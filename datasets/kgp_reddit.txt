Title: I think this is the best Rangoli ..

I may not have seen all the rangoli in the halls, but the one which which have won were not as good as this one. Maybe because Gokhale is a small hall it suffered the politics of KGP

Just saw this post about this Gokhale Hall rangoli here, and bro I’ve been doing rangoli for my hall for the past 2 years continuously, but honestly, what they made is next level.

The detailing, the concept, the whole f**king interpretation it’s too good. I even went there to see it in person and literally said, “Bhai sahab, kya banaya hai!”

And real talk I had no clue what Gokhale Hall even was. Thought it was some guest house 😂. But after seeing that, compared to those who bagged 1st and 2nd this one’s 10x better. Bade halls se toh kafi sahi hai ......mein kiski baat kar raha hoon pata hoga......🤞....aur baki bade halls toh chutiyapa hi karte rehenge ...evene mera bhi..... inko ragging se fursat mile toh khudse rangoli banayenge......
And I’m saying this as an artist myself this is not some biased rant. Everyone knows how these f**king results work here. Some halls bring in outsiders, professionals, whatever. But Gokhale actually did it themselves, and it shows.

Don’t know what the judges were smoking this time, but man, Gokhale deserved to be in the top 4 at least.

Real creativity got f**ked by politics again. Classic KGP shit. Krte raho chutiyapa......👍

which hall?

I like that Red Blue Shiv and Shakti better

I  visited this rangoli after this post it definately deserves position... ye chote hall bhi badhiya banate hein

This isnt rangoli. Can be made a permanent poster if drawn on walls

The best.

Bro this is just sooooo goooodd

My god this is amazing

This rangoli definitely deserved a spot in top3. This kind of politics must not happen at such premium institute level.

I assumed it a painting on the floor until I read rangoli

Aur vote do Praneet ko

Yes it is

Rp was also good

True but this wouldn't have won if it was fair either, Azad rk and jcb were something else, though jcb and rk had the same theme so they suffered

Call karu bacha🏆

Gokhale hall

[removed]

No no bro don't compare.

This rangoli can be at 3rd or fourth if its fair.... RK and JCB are top 2....MMM and BRH are not even deserving for top 5

first time hearing about this hall lol, though now i know i have seen it

Title: Not all heros wear capes some own a black marker

So proud of the guy for doing this. Man these people who cant flush need to learn how to behave in a public space..They don't have the right to call themselves "iitian".

Matlab basic personal hygiene bhi nahi hai kuch ladko ke pass ki aisa notice board lagana padd raha hai

Shameful, hands wash bhi nhi karte, naa flush karte h

Aise logo jaha mile waha maro bc

Also the ones who don't lift ring before pee

Plot twist, it was Golu all along

For a second I thought I was viewing a post from my college but it turns out the situation is same here lmao

Mummy yaaaaaar

Kuch lawde ko to mutne ke baad pani daalna vi nhi aata... Patanhi ghar pe kaise rehte hai

Some tips.

When you try to rotate the flush lever and it doesn't make the water flow.. -> Open the lid and pull the flush valve up. It is like a pipe which needs to be pulled up to allow the water flow into the commode

\-> If there is no water in the flush tank, then probably the flush valve didn't come down to lock the water flow. First try to pull the handle fully up. If the water flow still doesn't stop then open the lid manually press the flush valve and flapper to lock it in place.

\-> Before starting your work always run the jet spray to check if there is water, otherwise no flush for you and it will be difficult to wear your pants back as well !!!!

These are some of the things which I learnt from general observation of the toilet I use everyday here.

I feel the need to share this with my college mates even tough these things are meant to be taught to some FUCKING 3YR OLD BABY!!!

I hope that you flush the toilet next time and don't make the toilets' condition like the sleeper coaches in train

Edit: more detailed explanation

I have been laughing for the last 10 mins.

Uncle Ned

Heroes\* issey pehle koi bina flush karne waala grammar sikhaaye

Who tf forgets to flush 
Ts is beyond me 🙏🏻

So op is chhota golu.. 🤡

Similar thing I read in IIT Roorkee.
- If you can't flush properly then you are not a human being at all. 

So I double checked every time to ensure whether I'm a human being or not.

And they can't even be bothered to read that and comprehend.

Inn madharchod logo ki Maa ki chut bc sare achhe washrooms ko ganda krdete h bc fir washroom hunt pe nikalna padta subah subah bsdvale sale

Golu se dur raho sala Gand saaf Krna bhi bhul jata hoga 🙂

creativity awaaj 👉👈

I get the humour and the point of the post, I appreciate the attempt as well, but why targetting his mom for his fault, it somehow doesn't sit right with me.

Nigga SYBAU 🥀

Golu mera petname hai... Kasam se

My name is Golu

Even in an educated institute, this is the mentality of boys. Take out your frustration by downgrading sisters and mothers and treat their bodies as some sexual objects for taking revenge for the wrong behavior of men related to them. Why don't you go after the men in the family? This is so disgusting. You think you're acting smart by putting up such a notice, but clearly you're shit yourself. You need to be flushed out of the system.

Ab iitian kehlaane ke liye tatti bhi dhoni padegi🙂‍↕️

In other news, Golu is bloody misogynist.

Chaddi bhi share karlete hai ladke. Girls' toh apne bestie par bhi trust nhi karti

Bhai I swear I have talked to so many about this(I know it sounds weird but it is not trust me) and I was myself disgusted to know that like 4/10 of them don't...

Can i be ur moms golu

Yes i am golu and i know all about you😊

Because his mom raised him the way he is now, surely he would have stayed in a home where his mom flushed for him and never made him realize how gross it is, and guess what it didnt work today morning the toilet was filled with shit so even if the joke on their mom couldnt drive them idk what will

Brother, sleeping with someone without consent, itself is an ill-statement, be it someone's mom or dad. It clearly does not have any literal sense, over here. This is not the place to divert a different issue to patriarchy and morals. Try not to act enlightened and 'humane' in a reddit comment section, but actually stand against injustice towards female in real-world. Will help you gain more attention. We don't need such digital spines. And go flush before it's too late. Thank you!

Sadly you dont understand humour, It is attack on people who dont flush and its a comical way to say it, tera baap chuda bolne main mujhe dikkat nahi hain but sadly you west influenced pussies always miss the bigger picture and end up making it an issue on gender, sexuality and caste. Sometimes its more imp to find the solution, Ek ladke ke liye uski maa jyaada precious ek ladki ke liye uske papa, If you dont use this language good for you but we clearly dont need your moral policing. And no ones mother is disrespected if they flush

Guys this guy did not flush.

this guy *stinks*

Golu sleeps with this guy's mom

Nothing to be proud of , hope people of ur mentality remains far away from me ..touchwood!!

College should give a class on hygiene before starting the course atp

I get it, but why just blame mom or sister or the lady of the family everytime? Upbringing of a person is not just a job of the female of the household, why just blame them everytime. And moreover if he's 18+ and yet doesn't realise such a basic thing, then he's a disgrace and it's his fault!!!

Sister, understand the these jokes are the main problem which leads to bigger problems in the society. It's the cheap mentality. As I said, some humans themselves are the actual shit and we need to flush them out sooner. I do flush them out whether online or offline.

Okay but i dont think thats the main issue here...abusing the mother and sister of family is a general issue and its better if you raise it in places where the main agenda is related to this...The issue being solved here is much greater so lets not divert from that and waste our energy

I get it✌🏻

Title: Some chats with a professor...

Disclaimer: This is a throwaway account and I won't be replying. Probably. I won't name the professor as (1) they have left and (2) I don't really care about any punishment.

I interned under a professor as a B. Tech. student who to the best of my knowledge, is no longer is employed by KGP. This was during my non-senior years. I'm making a post now as I feel I have been quite successful in life and have enough connections to not get me into any trouble. But this will probably be the only post from me. Probably.

I also have a ...peculiar mindset to say the least... so I am not traumatized by these posts. I simply don't care.

But I have a question to ask: what will messages like these, from a professor to a student, affect people's mental state?

I have no bones to pick and neither do I want any sort of "revenge", and that's why I won't name them. I simply question the authority given to professors, and how they have the audacity to send this. Especially given what has been going on this year.

"contribution to India's GDP!", my hod told us on the induction program that they will make us global citizens

Name and shame, not for you, but for other students who might get trapped by this asshole.

IIT professors do sound like Viru Sahasrabuddhe!
No wonder most of you guys become stand up comedians 😅

No wonder suicide cases are high over there.

That's sounds so painful to read my god.

[deleted]

Why have is spelled weirdly everywhere?

Let me share one story with you. So, one of my friend got an internship in electronics department of IIT KGP. So, oneday his mentor came and asked how much he was able to learn from that internship. After saying that he is trying to learn as much as possible the reaction from the professor was astonishing. He said that the intern was not there to learn but to work for his project and lectured the intern should only work as instructed. 

Even my dissertation mentor in KGP was a complete psycho. I literally cried in the lab. I know why so many suicides are happening. But we can do nothing. 

Just one suggestion "stay low, don't grab any attention".

Life in kgp has made me realise that having simple dreams is the key to a simple satisfactory life. Fuck the professor's demands and the competition, we do what we want to

Hope you ahev done as she said!!

I am a working professional phd student, i was tensed that my mtp and btp students are trying to do too many things. One day i got onto a call with one of my students, i told him don't do this you will start burning out. I even told the student he can drop the project, and let's work on some thing else if the project topic was the issue. Then i got to know from the student that the student was trying to do too many things simulataneously, which had caused mental fatigue. There's mental fatigue that people ignore quite a lot. All I request to all the students, it's ok, you don't have to prove anyone anything. Just do what you like but at the same time don't be too relaxed that will fire back. If you are not making it in somethings, it's ok. I studied in a namke wastah govt college where hardly classes used to happen but the college was surviving due to the old legacy being 100+ years old. I had less than 8.0 cgpa in CS related branch. I used to score 40-50 out of 100, in total, in math related subjects. Today I am working in a big company that pays almost as much as MAANG companies(only thing is RSU in MAANG appreciate quite a lot, here its more stable increase thus net net my realized pay becomes less which is ok, atleast i have peace of mind). If i could make it, then you guys can also figure things out. Nothing is permanent, if something is lost today, can be gained if not the same thing, instead gain something else. Enjoy your college life, you won't get it back again.

This idiot wants to make you work AS A SLAVE for an UNPAID RESEARCH INTERNSHIP. Don't fall for her bullshit, it is not our responsibility to build someone else's dreams without adequate pay. She thinks you are valuable, that's why she's trying to browbeat and shake you into contributing. So don't be disheartened, just realised that she's an awful boss to work under and look for opportunities elsewhere....

[deleted]

Well, I had two major unpleasant experiences with professors - and many minor ones - during my time at IIT Kharagpur. I also went through a phase of depression, partly because I used to be something of a teacher’s bootlicker (which I’m ashamed of now), though not to an extreme degree. Fortunately, my parents were there for me during my lowest mental point.

I once dreamed of becoming a scientist and doing something for the country and for humanity. But after facing the professors (aka the devils), I said, ‘Screw social service,’ and switched to IT. Most of my academic friends cut ties with me because I didn’t join them in the US for an MS/PhD. During B.Tech, I was very close to the "Maggu", "Semi-Maggu", and "Machau" batchmates. We often solved assignments and projects together, and they genuinely appreciated my problem-solving approach.

The situation with my college friends is still the same, but I’ve moved on and made new friends. I’m now working in Europe (thanks mostly to sheer luck), and that has helped restore my self-esteem. I no longer feel inferior to my batchmates in the US. And where I live, nobody even knows what IIT is - so my identity is simply as me - my name and my skills at work, and nothing else.

The professor in your posts is nabanita Datta who left iit kgp in 2023 right?

Yup she looks like she want more unpaid interns

Desh ke naam pe gaslight krra behenkaloda lmao. 

If it matters so much to him then kyu nhi apni jeb khali krke tujhe ya sabko accha pay ya stipend dera.

Sara garz one sided h kya?

a simple google search of "iitkgp professor working on wind turbine" will tell you the name of the prof.

L*nd IIT krega GDP mein contribute. Ye hai labour for west producing archaic institution. State of art inke g**nd mein itna boota nhi ki ye kuch develop kar paaye khud se. Shakti chip banaaye thhe hagg dia IITM ne. Aise din bhar research hote hain ye banaya wo jhande gaad diye. Par US patent jh**nt barabar nahi ho pata aur na sahi se academia industry collaboration hai jo IIT dwara banaya gaya product Market mein launch ho paaye. Ham sab made in china consume kar rahe aur ye bsdk iit ka L*nd choosna band hee nahi kar rahe.

She is frustrated with life. There were certain profs in IIT who used to hate me and use to single me out and threaten me with supplis and redoes and lab bans simply because I had long hair. It was hell. These profs just wanted ego boosts since profs in these universities and themselves losers without any creative spark or ambitions and have to ass lick their colleagues for miserly grants and such. IITs and NITs are basically slave factories where innovation and critical thinking is discouraged. We are many decades behind the rest of the world in terms of engineering because of these Jurassic era institutes and also Indian student mentality of yes sir and ass kissing. Yeah but it all turned to be fine in the end I wish I could meet those profs one day and tell them how I minted fuck loads of money, worked with some of the most creative people on the planet and retired at the age of 34 and didn’t turn out to be the slave that they all themselves turn into and expect their students to turn into.

Man I thought IIT profs are busy intellectual people...but this

I have a general rule (although recently made)... If you want peace in life avoid highly ambitious women... They can go up to any extent to destroy you if things go south
===
Also it's very childish to make IIT's first WT.... 
Indian companies Suzlon, Inox, Enercon etc. are manufacturing and exporting indigenous WT to the world (although inferior and smaller compared to the GE or Vestas)...
What's the point in reinventing the Wind Turbine (wheel)...
It would have been better had helped Suzlon etc to compete with global giants...

Now it makes sense when students are killing themselves.

very filthy conversation. disgustingly intruding into personal space. if this kind of emotional blackmailing happening all the time, then students will definitely think about suicide. those who are brave will be the lost cases. some of them will come to the newspaper, while others shrugged under the rug.

Man years of academia does drive professors crazy. Not defending this but after a PhD this kind of behavior does not make me think bad about her. She has been through all this in her own journey and trust me usually it mellows down with generation so if she is saying this to you just imagine what all she has been told when she was in her academic years. The entire PhD postdoc professor line is toxic and after going through all this most of the prof become what they hated in the first place as an undergrad.

Ghanta responsibilty to nation. Nation ne Hame kuch nahi dia corruption aur tangi ke alawa. Agar marne lago toh nation thodi bachayega. Apna khaao piyo paisa kamaao aur apne parivaar ke liye reponsible raho. Ye nation ka dildo inn prof. Ko lene do. Tumhare aage jindagi padi hai jo mann aaye wo karo, jindagi apne hisaab se ji jaati hai koi cutout formula nahi hai. Ye hijli jail(IIT kgp) Jaisa chutia place maine jindagi mein nahi dekha especially khaane aur unecessary cycling of 5+km waste in scorching sun to take classes from MMM hostel to Nalanda is utter waste of time and energy.

i am not sure if i would have been able to keep my temper if someone spoke to me this way....despite knowing the consequences... 
i really need to work on them emotions

yeh professor bol toh aise rahi hai jaise kgp mein bacche padhne nhi indopak war ki tayari karne jaa rahe hai

All this for a wind turbine? Damn.

It looks like the professor is frustrated with her own life, which is coming out in such a way. If she genuinely thinks that India will become technologically superior if IITians all contribute, then I have a bridge to sell her. 
 
Technological superiority can only be achieved with a top-down approach, starting from the government. What is our R&D budget for 2025-2026 again? When the government is super tight with its purse strings, what can we normal people do? Spend our own money? What an idiot of a professor.

IITs are joke now and I mean it

Iss professor ko bolo pehle have or after likhna learn kr le fir gyan de

Talking as if she had fixed global poverty and global hunger lmao.

[deleted]

They could have said it in a much better adn encouraging way tbh. part of what they said makes sense, but the way they said and their intentions isnt good at all.

Hehe.

Accha nationalism hai IITs mei. Ye post car kisi bade subreddit pei like r/indiadiscussion

I am under a project, not a student, but we have to work on Sundays, and there are no holidays such as Independence day or Mahavira Jayanti, as such . We are given parallel tasks to complete, and strict deadlines for the results. It's tough being here.

She herself wouldn't have contributed anything worthwhile and also eats perks as a professor. 
Khudki salary chod ke desh ke liye karo na kaam BC

i see why murthy is still in trauma.

Being an IITian is a national responsibility lmao

family over career always

My eyes muscles started to hurt reading "ahev"

I don't expect anything from these profs. Honestly, only a few profs from IITs are making real contributions. Everyone else is there to earn saaris for their wives and diapers for their kids.
Mediocre profs. Not even the best people are trying to become professors cuz of seeing this kind of pathetic people.

She is from my city lol

the professor is an asshole he himself hasn't done anything to the technology is just a professor

Mall and INOX visits do contribute to India's GDP though...

Who made her a professor ?

Teacher toh aisi baat kar rahi hai jaise she is the richest woman in india

The only good point in there was " don't flex before proving yourself" other than that everything is bs

You only live once buddy, please don't be gaslighted by such people who try to brainwash a slave mindset into you.

How she felt after typing all that

She is trying to groom you.

I just read her blog and honestly we re each of us going through our own shit. This lady seems to have been going through trauma as well, so OP just be kind. Maybe catch up with her I think she s in a better place now - reddit will get you revenge if you want and there are plenty reporters lurking here who ll publish this story and malign this lady but truth be told she was also going through some stuff of her own and profs are equally human and capable of saying shitty things reserved for corporate middle managers. OP time to bury the hatchet on what seems to have been a traumatic past for both of you

Am I an illiterate yafir madam se HAVE nahi likha jara?

Psycho

If India wants to progress, managers of all kinds and stripes have to learn to be less toxic and learn that leadership is different from micro-management. One of the best ways to learn management is from the original Star Trek. How to take responsibility, accountability, professionalism, work life balance. and most importantly how to have the back of your team.

Fuck proff they also don't make any contribution to India. By writing lab records we won't make Jet fighter engine or hight tech Ai technology. They don't teach. They show us slide. We learn from youtube and skillshare and udemy. If they leave the college na...nothing will impact students.

She needs to get a life

Bro this is toxic. Period!

LOL these guys talk like IIT is such a big deal. Idiots.

This seems to have been misdirected.

What a dose of tough love but she's speaking facts, under stern leadership will this country excel

itna khaali professor kon hai bhai ????

Oh man I'm not even from iit and i got so fucking scared and sad after reading these messages. How did you even cope up with this😭😭

clearly the professor is insane. i mean do millions of students give jee every year to try and get into iit's just to make india technologically superior. No, most likely, they want to move up the economic mobility ladder, and there's nothing wrong with that. you don't have to be thinking about your country all of the time, and it's okay to want a better life for yourself, and working hard to get into an iit is a way to do that.

Dhasu Prof hai bhai ye
I don't think he was wrong in pushing you forward

Grade A Narcissist spotted

All the crucial points about this interaction are already highlighted by the other commenters.

I just wanna say, bragging and boasting, acting high and mighty yet she is confidently wrong, lol!! Every individual contributes to the GDP from birth, is she forgetting the most basic fact that to have a GDP you must have consumers? What an idiot!! 🙂🙏🏻

Saw this on all and I’m not Indian but …..

Firstly why the constant saying sorry. Fuck. Stand up for yourself. 

Secondly you said ‘my mindset is different and it doesn’t bother me’ are there students this would bother? If my professor spoke to me like this I would have forgotten about it one minute later.

Real toxic 🚫

These kinds of people are needed in the civil sector, because roads…

Pehli baat tho, madam ki priorities hi bakwaas hain.

India doesn’t need wind turbines. India needs wind tunnels.

I am from 2009 batch. Nothing like this used to happen back then. Absolutely shocking to know.

This post and thread is a reminder why there is no future in this land. RIP

So fucking scary and rude

The real mentor 😊

!gif

Just playing a devil’s advocate here, isn’t the professor partly correct in her arguments? Aren’t these the exact reasons why people diss JNU? Middle aged men and women eating tax payer’s money on the name of Phd and higher education?

Bruh and then they’re crying wolf when people kill themselves

She’s contributing to GDP by eating up tax payers money and doing the bare minimum.

She has clearly overstepped her professional boundaries, report her maybe

Generational crashout. She needs to work on herself

maam cannot type 'have' lol :v

Arey tu IIT ki professor hai, kya ukhaad liya bc?

Ouchhh

Are you KETUL SAGAR from Nashik..?

Why the personal comments bruh, fuck this person’s shit up man.

I kind of agree with the prof

अरे भाई नाम क्यों छुपाया है इस घटिया औरत का? 😡😡 खुल के सबके सामने इसकी करतूत लाओ... ऐसे लोगों को प्रोफेसर बनने का कोई हक नहीं है! 😑 Don't worry about the consequences when you're right...right people will understand and help you. If this keeps on continuing and you guys will not raise your voice...then GOOD LUCK having this slave mentality for life and defending and feeding these ill-minded SIR and MAM'S. Look at her goddamn logic "buying sarees and diapers" तो तू क्या पहनती है और अपने बच्चों को डायपर नहीं पहनाती क्या? 🤣😒 I mean you gotta respect elders but this is just INSANE! अगर स्ट्रिक्ट होना भी है तो यही बात थोड़ा सम्मानजनक तरीके से भी बोली जा सकती थी थोड़ा तरीके से भी डांटा जा सकता था स्टूडेंट को...but look at her attitude! Like just because someone is not paying taxes (which BTW you already paid a lot on whatever was spent on you including that IIT fees in form of GST and all)...even if somebody is not paying taxes, does that give her the right to TALK like that? 😡😡 PLEASE BRO gather some more people and raise voice against this... वरना जिंदगी भर ऐसा ही चलता रहेगा और आगे भी जो बच्चे आएंगे उनके साथ इस तरह बदतमीजी करने में यह मैडम और कंफर्टेबल हो जाएगी इसीलिए केवल अपने लिए नहीं भाई लेकिन पूरे समाज के प्रति और जितने भी स्टूडेंट अभी है या पहले जिनके साथ ऐसा किया होगा या आगे होगा उन सब के प्रति जिम्मेदारी समझते हुए आपको आवाज उठानी चाहिए...AND EXPOSE THIS DUMB ARROGANT LADY!

And BRO if you need my help...I know some people in media houses, if you want they will publish this story, you'll have to provide all details. And if you want, you will not be named anywhere. I am not being hyperbolic brother but this is the time to go against it...and why you saying only SORRY MAM SORRY MAM SORRY MAM...at some point you'll have to raise your voice or atleast respectfully but STRICTLY reply to her that Mam this kind of behaviour is unacceptable and will not tolerate it further...please be respectful and take care of students dignity...you professors are not the only ones who deserve that"....something like that...if multiple students will have the the courage and brain (irony here for IITs) then how much they will cause trouble for each of them?

You'll have to start and gather other students to do the same...Anyways, I hope you got the point brother and no further talk is required. And please DO INFORM ME id you need media help...again, YOU WILL NOT BE NAMED if you don't want to, but will to provide all details. Anyways GOOD LUCK FOR YOUR LIFE 👍 and PLEASE if you ever get to some good position in life, NEVER EVER have such attitude towards anyone. She us a STUPID LADY! 😡😡 And do inform me if you wanna take action through media...or do it in your own way but raise voice or reply strictly to that mam...else good luck and keep a lot of SORRY reserved, thats all you can do then for life. 😞 Hoping for your best brother...STAY STRONG! 👍😌

Source: trust me bro
It really happened bro
She goes to another school

Kinda agree with prof. And such outburst dont happen randomly for sure. You need to introspect yourself first that why she had such outburst. We, the middle class, look upto the iit/iim guys to change the nation to a certain limit. I was preparing for JEE, at that time i understood iit is not for me because its too hard. Fellow pupils who were serious about getting into iit, saw them work hard that I can't even imagine. So, probably we dont like crybaby iit/iim people, as we have extremely high expectations from them to do something really big.

Just read her latest linkedin post, she is bragging that at age 42 she is financially rich. It seems like she is insecure about the fact that she is unmarried, I am glad i never had such profs.

IITs first wind turbine Paglu

Ye mam ne IIT ka professor banke kya aisa ukhaada?

I guess she felt like she needed to scold you? Why I don't know. She appears to be an asshole here, but what do I know. Just take it as constructive criticism I guess, and ignore the negative stuff. Now obviously this didn't affect you much so that's good.

IITian? Professor is confused between IAS and IIT

That "ahev" is so annoying

Is this Prof from Ocean and Naval?

Ye pagal professor apni life ki frustration student pe kyu utar raha hai? Hum na jhelte ye sab!

Almost all IITians leave this country run by clowns and settle abroad. Buying groceries and diapers is way better than getting thrashed and abused by dimwit sarkari babus. All in the delusions on "contributing to the country".

If you have succeeded in life as you claim.. a petty "aukaad Bana liya bsdk" to this professor will go a long way to calm your soul. Don't expect a reply. But sometimes pettiness is justified.

this is pretty unbelievable sht, but if its true then damn

ahev

Have ko ahev kyu bolri lekin? Is she contributing to the dictionary or something?

Is your mam dyslexic?

Bhai teenager se socha toh galt h but , actually she is right , maybe she have been through what she is talking about , i think unki thinking ye h ki , the things that she achieved but due to family pressure couldn’t her dreams, and she don’t want her students to be at her position at her age… bhai har cheez ko negative nahi lena chahiye , kabhi kabhi dusro ko samajhne ki koshish karo…

Not from iit. Idk how this came on my feed but gosh what a horrible woman to be taking out her frustration on kids. While not even knowing how to spell basic words like “have” 

I hope you get the coolest job ever, go on loads of vacations and enjoy your life then throw it at her face. Good luck to you.

that is a terrible way to inspire.. could have taken a different approach to inspire..

YIKES.

Have*

ahve :)

[deleted]

Some deep rooted issues there

ngl it's not your fault , it was your proffesor's fault to assume that you were a different person who wanted to achieve something in life not to just be a commoner like others . That's why he is angry, but he is chosing to take it out on you .

I cannot believe that you just wrote "sorry ma'am". Ik its better to not mess up with professors but this is way too much! And her audacity to target a student personally, And her comments "Shadi karo, Bachche paida karo", What a pathetic women!

Who is this bitch

Ahev

Jaa naaaa bheen ki lodi in my mind trying to come out.

Ask her to calm down her tits

Memdi ae memdi

Bhai literally these iit paglus are self centred maniacs who think sun revolves around there iit campus and somehow there life too

Like the ones who come from a very poor or lower middle class background and clear iit wil literally tell your life is worthless if u dont have an iit degree😂😂(i have a realtive of such sort...hes a 40M and hell bent towards this particular fact about being IITIAN like literally u cant even imagine the lengths he is going to convert his non chalant son into iitian...and i can tell hell commit something if his son doesnt crack iit )

Fkin , i ask whats success to you?
Working in a good Mnc?
Having a govt job u dreamt?
Having a successful startup?
Earning say 1 cr per year?
Settling Abroad?

For that guy these all are worthless if youre not an iitian😂...

"ahev"

Sounds like a Coldplay gaslighting, just brutal

She is right, though; however, the way she conveys her message is atrocious.

,

I still can’t believe it that it is true. Since when professor has started showing this much interest in other folks live and they are chatting in hindi

Never in my 4 years I have seen a professor saying more than 2 sentences in Hindi.
Writing in hindi is way out of scope

Just report the professor

Which prof talks like this man? Almost looks like a student is chatting

You handled it so well dude 👏👏

Wo velli hai bhai. Na husband, na bacche, na mall jaati :P
You focus on your studies, your learning and also on your family and life. 
Sab baatein acchi hai but bhagwaan na kare jab last day aayega la¥da yeh wind turbine yaad aayega. Yaad aayenge sirf moments, dost, pehla pyaar, maa baap. Last ke kuch seconds mein bhi. Make sure you have some good moments to revisit that last day.

LMAO the first wind turbine? You guys are like decades behind the rest of the world, that's so pathetic.

you should have gone to the cops. this is mental harrasement and breach of privacy. she may not be in a relationship or have children and dream of flying strapped to a wind turbine... but this mentality towards is not healthy. remember to be successful and invite this beeswax to your wedding and ask to leave since single entry not allowed. lmao, Hire some lady bouncers for extra fun.

Why does she write ahev for have? 
Is she dyslexic?

First you better learn to spell "have" correctly then you can lecture on the kid's future

Ye professors PhD krke khud ko bhgwan maanne lagte hai, narcissistic and rude.

Bhai pakka assistant professor hoga, they want to get more papers published, more PhD done for their promotion.

With that personality, nobody would want to be near her. Hence spitting venom to mask jealousy and frustration about you having a life outside gadha majdoori.

If IITs are trying to build their "first wind turbine" in 2025 toh kya kehne...

Bhai tu itna seh kaise liya, teri jagah mai hota, toh yeh professor agle din college me nahi dikhti

fuck this teacher. kahi aur ka gussa isss bande pe nikal gaya.

Wtf happening in IIT's ? 🤣🤣🤣

ahve

If you don't name and out such people, then you are exactly what your prof told you to be. You are here not to make the country a better place but to gain some momentary sympathy and run away. 

To make it a better place, you have to use the tools in your hand and that here be to expose anyone who you see is not in the best interest of the country.

So yeah, this be a throwaway and that you don't really care actually drives home to the point that your prof (who is an evil person) right!

!gif

All of this just goes on to prove that: Every time we say things like “this is how the world is, deal with it” or “ to survive in this world you must bear poor behaviour” , we make the world a worse place.

Even in the worst case I can imagine a professor being this angry only with a PhD student because there are some responsibilities involved but doing this to a [B.Tech]( intern is simply criminal. It's an unspoken rule that nobody expects anything from undergrad interns. If they do well then it's actually a bonus.

Campus mother ultra pro max

The professor wants free labour.

Being an IITian is not a "national responsibility". Pretty sure every IITian with a brain is aware of that.

Her linkedin recommendations are crazy , maybe she is a "good" professor , but crashing-out on an UNPAID INTERN is not justified on her part ! And you keeping quiet and still trying to be respecful? Its indirectly boosting her ego, idk what you did as to why she crashed-out on you like this , i believe that there is always two sides to a story without the full-context of what you might have done, i'm not going to judge her like how everyone is doing , but i wouldnt have kept quiet when she said " Tera sorry baad main hoga, pehle clean your brain"... this line of hers makes me question you as to what you might have donee that she's talking to you like this

She isn't wrong tho. Move in silence bud

56% of Indian women over 25 have a primary school education.

omg she could calm her +its

Somehow that evening timestamp tells me that alcohol might be involved in inflating ego of that poor "professor"

Ek baar meri baat kara usse

That's insane.

I feel like day-by-day Teir 1 university/colleges are loosing their value because of all such people and their horrible management.

Ahev

A professor who can’t even type ‘have’ the right way😭

Just say sybau

did i just witness whiplash iit kgp version?

I mean. There is some merit to what she's saying. To achieve great things sometimes you do have to sacrifice.

No one realises this until he is 50+ and attending two cremations a year: “Family should be the only priority”

Madam atleast enjoy a kid his vacation peacefully 😭

"ahev" 🥀

She is a nutcase indeed. Seems like the only thing she did was studies - brain couldn't mature/develop.

Ts shi pmo

"But ma'am wo have ki spelling thodi galat hai."

Would be the best reply to her

Ahve

People have become so soft. I never expected Indians to do any better but just ew. The teacher sees some potential in this guy and cares enough to text him amd ask him to focus and give him a talk his parents might not be giving. There are alot many ways to be distracted nowadays and we are. She just wants him to study man wtf does it have to do with mental state and bullshit. You will regret not having a mentor in your later years. She wants what you can do. But you need to be guided and put in your own efforts. Indians are some slimy mfs.

How is this any better than caste lmao, what this lady (ashamed to call her professor) is a class mindset. Thousands have been graduating from IIT's and out of it very little have made 'India' better. Most just leave the country for better jobs and lifestyle. This lady is a boomer in delulu thinking IIT's are some holy grail of modern day.

Seems edited

What ahev you been doing yaar

God forbid someone has a life other than building wind turbines for a multi million dollar company 
gift them a belt on their birthday they might as well start beating the interns as slaves lol

Ye teacher masturbate bhi iit moan karke karti hogi 😎

I was in a conference once with an Indian researcher who was looking for jobs in Indian academia. I asked him where would be like to work and what his approach to teaching would be. He said I want to become a professor at IIT, and release my frustration of not clearing JEE on those students who have, make them work like slaves under me and increase my research quality and quantity. 
Looking at your chats, no doubt there are some of these kinds of professors at IIT.

Looks like every evil woman an indian serial portrays as lol🤣

What a Dick.

strong sarkaari naukar energy

Whatttt??? Am i reading it right?

This Teacher is probably smarter than most of Indians.

Gotta be satire lmao

Why women in power lose their mind?

Bhai main rehta to isko aisi middle class galiyan deta jiske baad ye kisi low class kachre ke dabbe mein bhi muu na chupa pati.

Excluding the glaringly visible classism, there is nothing wrong with her words.
It's refreshing tbh. An Indian Individual urging young adults to go the non conventional way instead of joining the melo drama.

The classist narrative and her filthy ignorance about India's class divide is very problematic tho.

Sorry mam 🥀

Oo but why wrong spelling of have or am i missing smtg what's ahev lol

What kind of wind turbine are you making bro ? A HAWT or a VAWT ?

Ye deshpremiyo ko mai mar dunga kisi din, har baat me ye moral high ground pakad lete hai

reply her : bakchodi mat kar lowdi tu bhi job hi kar rhi hai

Kya faltugiri hai bhai
Bc sb kuch family ke liye hi krte hai.
Ye aisi lady hai jisko apne mummy papa ke liye jara bhi gratitude na ho.

enlgish spkeaing... shitty person overall bruh

So many spelling and grammar mistakes.

Teacher sounds like a MILF

I ahev not seen someone use these spellings for have ever

Khopdi tod sale ka

Crazy🥀💔

This “professor” is so over her fucking head. She needs to step outside her bubble and realise that the world doesn’t revolve around IITs (no offence, they are good colleges), and nobody gives a flying fuck about “iit’s first wind turbine”, and doesn’t she also need a job to pay her bills ? Speaks with such narcissism. Lord, hell I’d love to get her in some legal trouble and suck whatever meagre amount she has made off of her SIPs

ye mbbs ke profs iit kaise pauch gye

Would have replied lw#a wind turbine

lol some guy even linked this reddit post on her LinkedIn 

!gif

Tech team ko bulao 

In professer ko uda do

I now have beef with this professor

Lol your username checkouts 🤣😂

The only reason they talk so much is because you let them

I used to have a teacher like this during my childhood. It destroyed my confidence, and my skills plumetted down so much so that i had failed that class. To compensate for failing that class, my other studies started to be affected, which made him worse, and then i failed the whole class and had to repeat the year. If you're or anyone is suffering through this, please take action against it because bashing something until it works is not the solution. It just destroys the very thing that is being bashed. Not only will it save an individuals life, but it'll stop his whole future from being tarnished. And much more people's lives.

She needs to have ….

Vestas India has pathetic leadership, HR and management who hired dev\*ls like her.

Jesus Christ , what a vile woman

What ahev I read😭

Be ready to see an article with a headline like -

"Student shares chat with an IIT professor. Calls the student typical middle class mentality desi nobody"

Well someone’s really frustrated. A good time is needed. A VIBRATING turbine perhaps?

Unpopular opinion. 

Trying to thrive as a professor at a top IIT is brutally stressful. You may have left behind Ivy League prospects to serve in India, only to face disillusionment, bureaucracy, internal politics, and a system that usually sidelines merit due to absurd policies and an unrewarding ecosystem. You're expected to produce world-class research, mentor students, manage admin, and meet global standards, on a salary lower than many entry-level roles. 

Staying motivated and sane requires more than just passion here. 

Yes, they need to stay polite and grounded, but maybe the system too needs an overhaul.

Professor ❌ Narcissist ✅

Thecher shuold ahev lernat egnilish frist.

These professors remind me of the movie whiplash and I always wonder if we all need these professors at least once in life or not at all. Few of their techniques might seem toxic but this conversation was pretty normal considering she doesnt have a family and maybe 'contributing her life to Indias gdp proactively'. I might be completely wrong about it, just my 2 cents. The question should be, "Did her methods make you a better person?"

Bhai bhot se iitian se jyda mere local businessman kamate hain or support krte hain local villages ko

So students from iit can’t have life?

Chutiya thee teri professor. Kisi diversity quota ke kaaran job mili hogi tabhi itna udd rhi hai. Khud ke dam pe job lee hoti toh humility bhi aajati.

bruh no wonder kids are offing themselves in colleges

Shes unmarried?? I wonder why

Didnt she ask him how the wind turbine works and his reply should have been Dame un Grrrrr 🤪

Sounds sus af, no teacher talks in such a casual language.

i thought meme post/satire hai at the start wtf

oh god, the amount of typos she had are embarrassing me

Tell her you ahve life

Lmao she thinks she's a prof at MIT or what?

ahev

This prof is full of shit and just manipulating you for their own selfish gains. You will find similar folks throughout your career, convincing you to work extra hard for their goals, making it seem like some moralistic thing to do. Well.. fuck them. Do whatever makes you happy.

Someone send this poor woman to therapy

Well even buying a choclate contributes to India's GDP, any kind of consumption increases GDP so it's not a right instrument. She could've used the argument "You're wasting taxpayer's money, we need to make much greater return to their money."

I wonder how much return did this Professor made for taxpayer's money.

Bhai she wanted you😈

Darawana

Should have left her on seen

Yeh do kaudi ki salary pr do kaudi ka tax bharke kitna contribute krti hogi GDP mein lol. 
“Average” IIT graduates definitely earns more than her and even those IITians who are family oriented, contribute more to the GDP based on taxes alone. Inki bakvaas research methodologies ki vajah se India ka naam badnaam h, not because of students

I'm not your lawyer but if I was I'd definitely get her in trouble for mentally harassing students. Bullying is not allowed in any campus and remarks such as "middle class" show you a person incapable of handling the art of teaching. File a complaint don't stay silent remember there were many before you and will be many after. Your kindness shouldn't be your vulnerability but your strength. Cowards like these deserve what they get

kya fayda itna crazy profile hone ka if you cannot convince it in a "human" way, rather than just shouting at someone. Whatever she is saying, vaise sounds right ki if you have to do something remarkable, you have to sacrifice your comfort and show up. But the way she is putting it, seems like it is her dream project, and forcing a student to get into it, and work their ass off (yeah the student wil be a part of something big) but when will such professor's understand it to convey and convince in a very calm and composed manner?!

Baat kadwai hai, but there is some truth to it.

this looks so fake lmao, no professor talks like that

It's indeed Nabanita Datta I interned under her in my 2nd year in the same nonsense impractical project 
And she told me to respect her more than my mom and that I am not fit to join industry

This shit is why I left India for Canada. Imma host a freaking party when I get my Canadian Passport in a few months! Thank God I left that rat race 😂🙏

IIT'S first WIND TURBINE !!!!! 
BHAI contacts bhej mujhe kaam karna hai kasam se. 

Nigga personalized turbine in a UNI??!?!??!?! with STUDENT ACCESS....bhai kya nhi simulate kar sakte udhar !!!!! 

What's the Size of turbine btw if you don't mind

And yeah that was really rude ....very arrogant proff to be h8nest and most stereotypical person 

Yeah anyways

Bhai what's the SIZE OF TURBINE TO BE HONEST MAN SAHI MEIN COMON TELL ME I'm not here to disrespect you but STILL IM CURIOUS. 

EVEN OUR COLLEGE PLANNED TO HAE THEIR OWN WIND TRUBUNE BUT THE PROJECT WAS SHUT DUE TO COVID AND THE BATCH WHICCH STARTED PROJECT GRADUATED. 

BHAI HAVING WIND TURBINE IN UNI CAN GIVE INFINITE ACCES 

NO NEED OF MOD , MOU with DRDO and ISRO 
no need to convince scientists for simulation validation

Build. Simulate and validate by yourself in your OWN CAMPUS. 

Bc IIT KHARAGPUR is actually on another level.

I think they had a mental breakdown in chat.

Proff was really good with their words.

Please tell me this is fake

I kinda get it. We've all turned into snowflakes. The teacher seems very passionate

Lowkey i feel shes right. But y the hell she is misspelling have everytime😭😭

Hope I had a great professor like her. I would fear not getting ranted for my smallness and mundaneness than being scolded by someone who wants to do and is doing something worthwhile.

oh did she make then?

This sounds like Nabanita Datta from Ocean engineering, have heard many horror stories about her from batchmates. 
Edit - Definitely her, her profile says she has left insti and her specialisation is wind turbines

I don't wanna. Maybe cause of any repercussions I might face. Although given the keywords in the chat, I suppose a select few might be able to narrow down.

Again, they're no longer employed by KGP. If they were, I might have named.

Yeah she can be

Asshole? There’s NOTHING wrong in what she said

Na bro, we have some amazing profs, and there are 1000s of graduating every yr, most of them are no comedians, few pivot. Likewise many become singers, musicians etc. They do it because they love it, not because there was any flaw in system.

Most?

There have been 4 cases in 2025 only

A glimpse into high-pressure jobs suicide rate, most probably. I believe.

Lmaooo

Both the audacity and the lack of autocorrect 😂

Nabanita?

she's typing really fast. look at the timestamps

maybe she types too fast

I'm an alumnus, but...

\> stay low, don't grab any attention

This hits. Even outside KGP.

Not defending the prof, but this work not learn thing is same in industry as well. The manager will say this to you.

!gif

My batch mates would laugh if they get to know i work in AI(not the API calling stuff, proper data oriented where heavy statistical analysis and modelling is needed), that's how bad i was in math. My seniors mocked me that i won't even get placed(irony was end of 6th sem i bagged a ppo from jpmc when some of the seniors were still sitting for placements). Believe in yourself, if you ever doubt yourself, look at my story and think "if this guy can make it, i too can make it".

>I feel sorry for those who say sorry too soon...

Speaking your mind can only happen in scenarios where there is no imbalance of power between the two parties. Student-Prof. relationship is not one of those.

I understand your anger but while you are in college, professors have a lot of power over you. The op was smart enough to handle the situation calmly.

great to be in Europe 
those people know how to live a life!

Bruh, what broccoli looking human is this

>behenkaloda

More like behenkilodi.

Nah. Gotta defend the good profs. Some I met, the best people I have encountered. I would curse myself now for being so stupid as a fresher, but they (the good ones) didn't. They shaped a part of me.

They are intellectual people ... don't mistake Intellectuality with kindness.

Avoid people (regardless of gender, but including this professor!) who weaponise ambition to dominate, belittle, or abuse others. But don’t fear ambition itself—it’s not the enemy. Lack of empathy is.

However, it ultimately boils down to your personal preference for what you want in a life partner. Peace is always paramount to lead a fulfilling life. 
Now, whether that peace comes from being ambitious in our personal or professional life is upon the individual.

This professor now works for Vestas ... how ironic.

Abuse you receive does not justify the abuse you force onto others.

wind turbines can still work at 9 pm night. okay? we are not talking solar power. okay?

Like what is ahev 💀

Because she is a professor at the college ,she has powers in that college

Lmao indiandisscusuion

Smjhane ka tarika hota hai woh uski maa nahi hai ek professor hai and her audacity to talk like he owes her money is insane

but they dont have iit aluminium rod

Changed my mind nvm. After reading all the comments I'm pretty sure the proff too was doing as the work of some governmental pressure and not for innovation. Fuck it. Also the sucude case is disaster in KGP. so yeah 

Thanks anyways

Then you need some mental help low-key if you believe ambition is more important and family is a waste! 😅

[Yup, definitely her just by the looks](

IIT's First Wind Turbine? 
Really? Did No IIT had a role to play in amazing Desi Suzlon Story(now that'd be a super hard pill to swallow)? 
Sorry for digressing from the topic, aka cruelty of the leader, but I seriously doubt "IIT's First Wind Turbine" claim. Since it is THE chip on this arrogant sir/ma'am shouldier. 
I'd really appreciate any comments. So curious.

Bangali female what else did you expect lol

WTF is a batchmate

I'm a little confused, what does " I don't really care about any punishment "mean ?

Ok, when did this happen? Which dep?

Left means visiting faculty. IIT's first wind turbine narrows it down a LOT. A simple google search will give you the answer in case anyone wants. Her own website mentions that this research was done to start wind technology research in IIT KGP. Also concurs with the story that this story is from a while back. 

If I am correct on who this person in, I am surprised she retains this mentality even after a US PhD (unless her PI was toxic too). There are strict social and institutional rules in place in US for these types of cases.

I don't know the name but I know exactly what is being talked about. I was present at the inauguration function of this thing.

If they can , they will find you out by any means .

Vestas is a Danish company, this is 100% opposite of Danish values if you bring it to a higher up from Denmark and refer these messages I am sure things can happen.

Ok Miss Nabanita Datta

Welcome, Welcome, Miss Nabanita Datta

What the fuck? Are you sane? That doesn't seem like sarcasm, Nanbanita Datta.

Yes man I understand. It was a silly joke that’s all.

[deleted]

A friend from IITM told me that there were 4 in one semester once. 

I myself am from IITD and there were 5 + multiple attempts during my placement year

fuck you mean “only”

4 cases is a VERY high amount - it should be farr farr lower , preferably zero

Her autocorrect is too busy to correct her spellings as it is contributing to the gdp

Ahev

[deleted]

[removed]

She is just doing 30 odd words per minute, my girlfriend does 90 words per minute, i wonder sometimes if she has a keyboard kinda setup paired with her phone.

Nah, autocorrect is like ham fakir aadmi hai, jhola pakad ke nikal rahe

And types a lot. I wonder how she kept the conversation engaging by not choosing to write an entire paragraph and then send, like my girlfriend does, it reduces clutter.

why is that? can you explain...

Applies Throughout.
*Dark Forest* Theory

that was really raw but intensely motivating 
thanks for writing this

I'm not a Science/Comm student, but your message has touched on many of my insecure thoughts, especially as an academically "average" student myself. 

Thank you so much.

Thanks for motivating me
I'm also trying to learn gen ai Ml stuff, with my weak maths 🙃

Hey brother, may I ask that if you introspect, what were the key differences in your actions or even those things which happened by luck, that lead to you in catching up with the race despite not having a great lauchpad to begin from? And lots of congos to you.

Bootlicking is the worst thing you did...learn to stand for yourself (in a respectful manner, you do not need to fall to the level of these professors) because it feeds their I'll ego and only encourages them to behave WORST to students after you...so it's your moral responsibility to atleast resist it in some way.

But this stupid lady should definitely be cursed 😡😡...just because there are some good ones does not mean you cannot hate the bad ones!

Right ✅️

Gender aspect :: I think you are young... And soon will get some real life lessons.. stay strong

Whats the irony

Yeah see the issue is since they have gone through way worse, this sort of statements may have been regular for them for 5-6 years of their life. For them this has been normalized. They don't think this is abuse. For them this is just some strong criticism.

Right ✅️

Appreciate the insight, Falcon. Next time someone feels burnout, I’ll remind them turbines work at 9pm too, great way to compare human exhaustion to spinning blades. Okay?"

oh mb i misinterpreted the timeline

Are Bhai point samjho, doesn't matter exactly konsa subreddit

😭bro try to understand, she must be in her late 40s or maybe even in 50s , bhai Buddhe logon ki kuch cheeze ignore Karni chahiye, I was just trying to convey that we shouldn’t take her message as a negative message😭

Brother who care, My one of relative per year revenue aroud 1200+ crores who cares about IIT, when you have business mindset or doing something big. BRO i respect you did hardwork and got the tag but what next bro today, People who have vission or ambition their DNA make them great their habits or their dream not just a degree from IIT, I wish you work hard and make a business TOO. coz business is directly contributing in GPD or in society. 

Between my friend is also IITIAN he is a good person and want to earn more but fear from dreaming big or taking big steps.

Son what are you talking about?

bio me wind turbine bhi hai

damn we are doxing her profile lol

Someone who was in the same batch as you? Same batch same college, but different class

Probably meaning that he doesn't want the professor to face repurcussions for saying these kinds of a things to a student.

Punishment that the teacher might get, I suppose. He's not concerned about making the teacher feel the heat.

I suppose I should be happy that I have no idea what that means

Ese logo ko miss nahi bolna chahiye

He doesn't mean 4 only ,he means there are 4 cases in 2025 only- meaning that is a lot for 1 year

You misunderstood. He/she probably meant that there have already been 4 cases in 2025 itself.

Hey dude, if your verbal aptitude is so low....so as to not understand what is written clearly, maybe you should not be in a iitkgp sub. 🤦‍♂

😂😂😂

[deleted]

said typical Nabanita datta

your gf is probably using text to speech or gesture keyboard. otherwise, it's very hard to type all this without mistakes. 

If she's using a normal keyboard, that's a good sign for your relationship.

Bro can't leave an opportunity to mention his girlfriend

Apparently she doesn’t have a smartphone because she’s smart

😭😭

😂

When you are exceptionally good at your job or whatever you do - you become the subject of envy, jealousy and manipulation. Everyone tries to take advantage of you, everyone tries to one up you and some people are straight up rude because your work ethic clashes with the non existence of theirs! You have to deal with SO MANY insecure people. Plus even your bosses will overwork you instead of rewarding you once they figure out what you are capable of, and will still find ways to mistreat you. I’m no IITian but I think I am good at what I do, based on the results I’ve produced.

In college my project guide tried to steal my code and sell it off for a grant! She went to great lengths to manipulate me for this, and when I graduated as well and started working she sent her new students to me to get the code. This is just one of the examples of the shit I’ve faced.

I wrote it short my brother, luck has not favored much. Is just that i have got immune(not compketely but to certain extent) to failures as i failed a lot! First year when i entered my college, all the people who were studying with me were folks who had missed getting into iits by few marks short. During our time the seats available was half the seats available nowadays. Now coming to the point, when i entered i thought i should be good but with start of academics, i didn't really get much interest in studying theory as i was more of a practical person. I joined the Entrepreneurship cell thinking i will so something. Volunteered for some events, meet some startup folks. I asked few of them for an internship, but didn't have the skills to make it, some even made fun of me saying, you think you know that you know stuffs but in reality you don't know it. This gave me a reality check. I learnt some basic development from youtube but didn't really understand what it really meant. Of the places i interviewed, i pestered some of them to take me in, i told them i didn't even want any monetary stuff, just teach me somethings. Almost all of them refused, one told me he is happy to see the drive in me but unfortunately he doesn't have time to teach me. I told him that may be minimal guidance should also be fine as i wanted something. He didn't say anything, things went on, i tried to learn somethings hear and there, tried competitive programmimg but failed miserably, some of my friends used to pull my leg saying kya hua tera josh! I used to sheepishly grin but lack of skill was the reality and i realized it. I tried many stuff nothing really clicked, but always had told myself, if not this may be something else. The last guy from ecell who told he didn't have time, one day told me, he needs help in building small app so learn ionic framework and flask(those days it was just miguel grinbergs blog for documentation), learnt it and started getting hands dirty and tried building the app. Was not able to completely build it as there were lot of unknowns in flask those times. Unfortunately his startup had to be closed so i was again alone. But this time i tried the only thing i was close to knowing, development! Tried to build some web applications using python flask, django, html, css, js, ajax, jquery. Used to attend hackathons but never won anything, did this for a year then i met an early stage startup founder who was the judge in a hackathon where i built a legal domain chatbpt(was using regex and if statements behind the scene), it was working okish but didn't win it though. That startup founder was happy to know what i did, and he told me he will take me as an intern if i pass his and his cofounders interview. Now in interview i didn't know anything except basic data structure like list, stack queue, aand some algos, had just byhearted some of them to pass in the exam but never really understood much as i didn't know where they were used. These startup folks thought be something during the interview and asked questions which i could answer. He then asked aboit AI, now i am a guy with half baked knowledge on CS fundas, now AI being asked, i said i don't know. They taught few basic stuff and asked advanced questions to teat if i am able to extrapolate my knowldege and answr, fortunately i could. This is how i got into the startup as a intern, learnt a lot of things and could apply them in real world scenario but still lacked DS algo needed to crack interviews. Gave up at one point, until i was shortlisted for phone interview for jpmc, so had to learn some bits of ds algo but was very confident about the fact that i will not make it if they ask difficult question. But somehow the questions were on my startup experience and time was up to ask about ds algo. Made it through phone interview. This lead to lot of things. Net net had i not have had perseverence, passion, drive and the most important thing, treating failures as stepping stone, i wouldn't have made it. Don't think of failures as a drawback, don't fear them, face them and accept reality. If you start accepting reality you will know where you stand and be able to Guage your current level and then take better decisions to move forward in life. All these things will come with experience! So face the failures, it's ok to be mediocre but the moment you realize and accept this, you will definitely find a path to shine better and get ahead in life!

and get what in return?more depression??

Maybe, i am open to any life lessons, but I don't think I am getting any younger, i am 30M btw 😅

This argument of yours is non-so-sensible...I mean I understand your point brother but If somebody has gone through this...The right lady or anyone with good mindset would have been more sensitive towards others...because a good woman would understand how it feels like to be treated this way! But instead she is treating others the same or even worse! 😡😡 What kind of excuse is this? 😑 That too is our assumption. Some people are just like that...she deserves to be hated for this and needs some mental care and treatment immediately. And even if I believe you...why she is being a part of continuation of that toxic chain? BATAO 😅 She is a horrific professor that's it...maybe her past also has to do with it or maybe not...but this is just downright VERY BAD behaviour, which can have devastating impact on that student...that's it! If you think deeply look at what she's trying to drill into his head...that "biwi-bache spending time with your family" is a waste and low-class mentality and success means all this BS! What kind of STUPID LADY says that? I am not denying what you said but it does not make sense as an excuse beyond a certain extent.

😛 it was a sarcasm of the chat, given the time your manager asked you through the chats. i meant it is an extremely unhealthy practice to send message at night. that's it! okay? 😊

I get it but it gets to a point where someone takes disrespect 😭😭😭 the guy kept his cool which is a great thing i wouldve been pissed😭

mujhe bhi 25000 crore kamana hai bhai

Bro wtf is that 💀💀 is that a matrimonial proposal

She's living an empty life... My family and my wife would be more important than the number of countries I travel & 5 star dining.

Sounds like a narcissist to me. Why would anybody write all this? Some of the things seem very personal and not something you randomly announce to people. She's a weird one for sure.

Everyone has a right to live as they wish to but her tone feels like she thinks everyone else who is married/ inherited money from parents/ goes shopping more than once lol etc are beneath her.

I sincerely think she has an autistic spectrum disorder.

no smartphone? how did she send those messages? via text?

Hahahahhahaa

How is she using WhatsApp without a smartphone?

Geez....she got issues...

Whats the purpose to become rich if there is no one to inherite and do rich people declare that they have become rich ?Like7Reply1 reply1 Comment on Pradeep Poddar’s commentWind Turbine Technologist | Vestas | Faculty, IITKGP | PhD, Univ. of Michigan. | B.Tech+M.Tech IIT KGP..

Really? I remember there was an advertisement for some openings to work on the project some 3 years back.

Using text to speech instead of calling me seems like her kind of thing. Appreciate your input.

90 wpm on mobile keyboard is doable tbh

Well the world record of on screen typing is 108 wpm so totally possible

What are you guys saying, the person here is soo good that she saving time contributes to the country’s GDP

Or swipe typing

Bro no need for this toxicity. But first i will ask you politely to refrain from engaging in name calling please :)

Heyy, felt the same thing after college. It’s only after burning a lot of fingers i have realised what Robert Greene (author of 48 laws of power) meant when he said, **never outshine your master** and how that affects the power dynamic between you and your boss.

Don't know you but this has inspired me to go hard at my goals in life. I'm in my 30s and just now started to learn programming. I often feel I'm late and that others have surpassed me in life. But this post of yours gave me hope that doors do open if you give it your all. Thank you :)

Its coming from 36yo m... although experiences makes us young or old... but still age matters, because if u get a lot of info at short time... you wont be able to process all

It's internalized. It's not toxic to her. You would be shocked to know things older professors make PhDs do on regular basis and you see others around you go through it like it's normal. It gets internalized. Yes most of the PhDs and postdocs stays unmarried very late upto early 30s. They have been driven by only work all their life. Family is seen as a hinder to growth. All this things becomes normal for them. 

Also the hiring in KGP is done by fellow professors who only care about research background. There is no HR, no psychometry. I personally believe after hiring professors should go through a some sort of detox treatment.

Hmmm… good. Wind speed decreasing. Ego stabilizing. 😊

bhai bus, nashe, poor habits, insab se door rehna hoga, or mei nei kal hi padha tha khi, tum kisi cheez ko kitna chahte ho ye uski bhookh par depend krta hain.

She thinks marriage is patriarchy, having family is patriarchy

Forget about the first line. What is your problem if someone chooses to prioritise travel and food to family?

Not everyone needs to do so

thats why she said those things. makes perfect sense. shes femc\*l and misery likes company

laptop?

You can also use a laptop

My exact question

Bet you got a good 5 min laugh out of it 😂

LMFAO 😭🙏🏼

Oooh I’ve read that one.. I love that book it’s so interesting.

in our college afaik, our teachers never ever disturbed students at any point of time beyond officially allotted timings of lecture hours. 😊

ha mujhe kfc bucket khana hai

not marrying isnt wrong, some people like being alone. but ye proff itne loudly bol rahi isska mtlb she is insecure and miserable. i know a few good folks who never married, are very happy but they never mentioned shit like her

i see

Well i think you at-least need to have Whatsapp on your phone just to link it to your pc lol! Or she might have took some friend's phone, you never know, and if she's not using a Smartphone, prolly using a Nokia-type phone or smth to receive SMS and calls, then the friend-phone theory is prolly real...

i see

she flies around using a wind turbine installed ... where u can imagine... and when she finds a loving family she swoops down like the demented and deranged vulture from spiderman and abuses them. before taking their smartphones.

Although i got a lot of information at a very short time.. a near fatal accident or attack, coma, wife filed divorce, unable to meet my child... i dont know what exactly has happened as i lost my memory...

But to process all these u need to be unemployed with a doctorate in engineering

Lmao haha

Oh! Stay Strong, man..I cannot relate or even begin to understand what you are going through..or how are you moving forward, but still keep moving forward, even if that means something small each day!

police found me lying on the road in a pool of blood dying like a street dog in a lonely street (I went to beach for a walk during night and was returning)... God had a different plan... Police and strangers saved my life... They Informed my colleagues.. who got me admitted into Apollo hospital... They also contacted my wife and family but they didn't responded, they were living in a different city... And I never saw my child after this... Wife sent divorce notice and I am only seeing her lawyer in court.. although my health was extremely fragile initially.. now recovering... Btw she is also a doctorate from iitkgp lol ...

Title: IIT's new research

IIT director wants everyone to drink cow urine because it has anti-bacterial properties.

Harpic also has anti-bacterial properties, will he drink it?

How does IIT not know the difference between a lab tests and human trials

Ammonia will not only kill bacteria, it can hill humans also.
 
Btw human urine also contains Ammonia.

My dad believed the same and drank it. Got ill for a week with severe stomach pains and vomitings. Later he started blaming the farmer for not feeding the cow with proper nutritious grass and water. We cant change their minds.

Imagine how nutritious the cow itself must be then! It's not like the Goras are a foot taller, and way stronger than Indians for no reason.

Then there is this professor basudev biswal from IITB who is supporting this cow urine thing by comparing the director to newton. Also gaslighting us by saying we are stuck in our colonial mindsets. No wonder we are so far in the tech race.

It gets more absurd if you look into scriptures. Cow urine is forcibly given mostly as a punishment for criminals and Papis but slowly the society accepted it as fit for everyone.

Please drink this and die out. May natural selection win.

There is no limit on human stupidity.

And then they wonder why so many seat in btech and MTech are not used. How are the “elders” so astoundingly dumb? Like it’s so stupid it’s making me laugh.

All IITs need have a cow excrement science department

Holy cow!!!

can't blame britishers for this 🐄🕉

Has there been any notable research released from the IITs in the past 4-5 decades? Not surprised that the volume of output is low and miserable

I am 100% in favour of providing free Gaumutra in bulk to all gaumutra promoters provided they agree to drink at least 500ml per day. This can be an experiment we can all follow. Let us see if this makes any difference.

Antifungal, maybe. But definitely not antibacterial. And why is IIT doing a research on biology and not ICMR or AIIMS?

Such bigot always existed now they are coming out.

Newton believed in alchemy and wasted his time in hopes to find the philosopher's stone

Aristotle subscribed to geocentrism

Maxwell believed in communication with the dead

Shockley, inventor of the Transistor and a Nobel laureate was also a eugenist

Ramanujan claimed that godess Namagiri whispered equations into his ear

All these people had wacky pseudoscientific beliefs but are still considered men of science and have their portraits and quotes all over Academic buildings in nearly all top Science and Engineering schools around the world whether it be India, China, EU, US or where ever "science prevails"

So why does Kamakoti stating his personal wacky beliefs is suddenly such a big deal?

idk how tf ppl are arguing in the comments proving that it "could" be right.

As much as cow urine having any medicinal benefit sounds ludicrous to me and peddling such information clearly seems dangerous, Kamakati has cited five peer-reviewed research publications, one of them from Nature, which support his claims and talks about beneficial effects of cow urine. He went further and welcomed anyone willing to do research on this subject proving him wrong or otherwise. Now, as a student of science, I don't know what more to expect from him.

People who know Kamakoti from before, I am sure, won't be surprised by his thoroughness. He is a very popular director at IITM and very much unlike other academic position-holders who are usually bone-dry political appointees.

U are representing this in a very wrong way, the research have a very diverse categories cow urine research is a different topic handled by a seperate body and china also do animal research (that other thing they eat them during research), but that does not represent India is not doing research in technology, 3d printer given by the iit kanpur, most of the tech startup ruling the world are gifted by the iits, and lasted maximum of the top tech companies ceo and major porton of their employees are indians ceos are iits don't represent India in such a low level, value the nation 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳

If you are so certain that research on cow urine is useless, then tell me the ultimate source of energy in Sanjay Singh (Desi Tarzan)'s body, who set a world record by performing an extraordinary task that China can never surpass. Value the research and respect their efforts.

And let’s not forget tulsi, which contains an immense amount of antibiotics and healing properties. Although it was patented by Americans, it is originally a gift from India itself.

The robotic girls in first pic are actually real girls wearing contume and not real robots. China is bad on faking things up

Next day some Indians will start saying that yoga is a sham

My uncle used to be doctor in PIMS, a crazy amount of patients used to come with severe stomach pain, high uric acid and whatnot because baba ramdev told them to drink cow muttar. Its crazy people don’t understand that urine is a waste product not something to drink.

Kyon kya dikkat hai bhai.
Atleast harmful microbes to marte hain na, human health pe kharab effects ki baat karna to vaise bhi papa hota hai agar topic religious hai to.

Same with havan, uska dhua bhi to poisonous hota hai kharab microbes pe(i admit humans k liye poisonous hota hai but still is country me rahne vale har ek citizen ki duty hai ki vo 1000s of years puraani practices continue rakhe 'ayurveda' k name pe vo bhi bina kisi fact ko check kiye/research kiye. Vaise bhi jo cheez religion k name pe kee jaa rahi unpe shak karna to paap hi hota hai)

I mean even if this is 100% true I would rather get the fever and potentially die than drink a urine.

[removed]

Panchgavya is medicine in itself. Try and then see...

So by this comparison, you are trying to convey that India does not pursue robotics, or that Chinese don't poach animals to make traditional medicine?

Largest mammals across species are herbivores, Elephant, Giraffe, Blue Whale, Even amongst dinosaurs, you'd find the biggest one to be a herbivore.

[deleted]

My whole family follows the ritual of a MAHARAJ who actully gives remedies to get passed without even touching books

No wonder many Indians are leaving this country

Welcome to the new era of IITs...
The best Institutes of INDIA❌️ Bharat☑️

I'm gonna play the devil's advocate. This is how research works, unless there is already an extensive study that there is nothing to be done here,, a research is the way to go about it. 

Apart from that, the comparison here is of 2 different fields entirely, the researchers working with urine are not the same building a jet.

Sanskrit bhi galat hai🙏🙏 pibami hota hai naki pinami lol

There is no point in comparing us to China. They are competing against the US. We have a long way to go.

Every heard of any animal on earth whose urine is a medicine cure all for humans. Probably not. So don't get your hopes up, just saying.

Not defending, but urine especially when fresh is probably the most sterile body fluid. It's unlikely you would find any bacteria in a healthy urine.

Peak dumbness

IIT M which is madras/chennai does top notch research compared to other IITs. Did we forget how chinese are obsessed with animal extracts in the name of traditional medicine?

People should be open to any kind of research the scientists or engineers developed in experiments of robots or ai are different and the ones who will research on this are different , it's not about every cow but some breeds , the medicines we take , most of them use animal products so what's wrong with this research . Grow up man

This is why India is called out in negative manners

This is severe propaganda. Kamakoti probably knows he is talking bs. He is a brilliant professor as I have heard from friends. Probably some ba propaganda he is spreading coz he is part of a religious sect.

Those Chinese androids are fake iirc

We are getting closer to dominating the world in technology sector very soon! 😑😑

Why does this post exist, making tech and researching animal urine is totally different, both can be beneficial, op i don't have a word for u

well panchgavya is an important input in Zero Budget Natural Farming (agri technique) so if some research can help farmers improve yield of his crop and and also make his practice sustainable then why not?

"Tume kya pata vishwa guru aise hi bante hai" - Andh bhakt mandali

The iit director said "if" researchers are interested to pursue in the subject 

Are u a idiot? Where he says he wants everyone to drink it ?

The world expensive coffee is made when a specific cat poop the coffee beans it gets fed so shouldn't that be disgusting too ? Yet it sells 

Im not defending iit director even if cow urine turns out to actually work " i would rather die before drinking it or any medicine made out of it"

These are just toys!! You are highlighting this news but you were mute when IIT M successfully demonstrated hyper loop!! Ignore such news and stop insulting our own country!!

China is run by businessmen disguised as politicians whereas India is free democratic country!!

The task at hand of any avg student here is to do the assignments, they dont care what the assignments are. These dumbfks just think at the end of their 4 years some knight in shining armour will come all over their face with a 50 lpa job and hopefully a ticket to murica. They dont care if its piss or potato science.

Once I get rich bye bye.....
. literally the iit director said this for sure....the top institute

This nation is inhabitated by losers.

It's sad to see that china's propaganda is winning, No wonder China has improved a lot but as much as it looks like . And we Indians also do have inferiority complex so it makes it even worse

Merit based admissions vs reservation based admissions

The extreme left pic on the china side, they were cosplayers IIRC

Vishwaguru 🤡

Systematic killing of rationality and scientific temper in progress here

Vishwaguru🤡

natural selection

We are evolving, but backwards.

Unfortunately all three things showcases as Chinese tech - they were dummies or a lie. Please do some research before posting it

So even researching something is bad? You all do not understand science, do you? India was mocked for using haldi as medicine until it was proved to be effective.

It can severely damage kidneys and liver what’s wrong with people.

He and his team had started building shakti processor, India's first open processor. Don't underestimate him.

when u dont understand the topic better enjoy insta /reels

First they laugh at you. Then they keep laughing because you're stupid. Then you fight them for laughing at you. Then you lose.

Hope science will prevail someday! 🤞

Holy cow! Condolences for your parentage.

pojeet for a reason

hope darwinism gets him

Sorry to say but that's peak copium behavior from him

If one is really that rational and open minded , they should support this research so that truth comes out.

He needs treatment, contact a psychologist.

Can't even ask him to drink again of a healthy cow to prove your point cuz ofc he's your dad.

 Where have we gone as a society 😐.

It's not advisable to drink it raw

[deleted]

Add /j, mfs would think that is for real and forget that concept of genetics

Actually wasnt there a line in upnisad that said to eat bulls or something ?

Yeah sure with all the 10 types of allergies they live with...imagine randomly eating a nut and then if you won't get an epipen in 10-20 mins your throat will just close up and you'll die...def def this is what we want in india

It is not just the meat consumption which is responsible for that though. They were warriors for quite a lot of time before and we were farmers. The topic is a little more nuanced than you think

That's sad!

Papis mare nhi lol ulta unko aadat lag gayi

if darwin knew about indians, he'd have a separate section dedicated to us

Are you an IITian ?

What ?

😂

Wtf 😅

Doesn't matter if it's antifungal or antibacterial, Urine is urine, a waste liquid excreted by an animal.

Exactly!

They are considered as men of science for their scientific contribution which are proven from time to time not their beliefs.
Science does not work like oh Newton believed in alchemy and he was right about the gravity thing so alchemy also exists. No you scrutinized the claim even if it's made by Newton or Einstein.
Even Einstein was wrong about Quantum mechanics.
But we don't accept Einstein's definition of quantum mechanics,why??? Because he was wrong about it.
We accept his theory of relativity because its empirically proven.

People will believe anything if a professor from IIT or any person on a higher authority claims anything.
That's a logical fallacy. We should scrutinized and test the claims of anyone even if he is a person of authority.
That's how science works.

whispering equations into one's ear does not kill you, guzzling cow urine can.

Cos unlike the others, he refuses to believe that urine has bacteria and ecoli, even after so many successful research papers have been published.

Baat me toh dum hai tumhara. But considering literacy rate of India, if Kamakoti's beliefs are publicised, then half the population might be eroded.

We got cow urine defenders before gta 6

Sure brother. Cow urine is especially important given that racists literally make fun of us because of our "Beliefs"....
Why these head of managements in these top universities don't advocate for lower taxes? Or improving India's schools ? Or even at bare minimum increasing government hospitals?

I don't need an answer of why India is the third world country and the butthole of the globe.

Nobody remembers Newton because he worked for alchemy and wasted his time in hopes to find the philosopher's stone. Same goes with other examples you have mentioned. We all remember these legends because of their significant contributions in scientific and philosophical fields. The problem with we indian people is we tend to believe more in superstition than science and even appreciate and glorify the people who encourages these kind of superstition rather than the people who actually do years of research in scientific fields.

Very good point. Thank you for providing this info, I didn’t know most of these before.

This is such a poor arguement, all those scientists belived those things because the science was not as developed in those times.

holy strawman argument. this nation is doomed

Does that mean we accept these notions? No. We only accept the facts that were proven by SCIENCE.

They didn’t have the entire world’s knowledge at the palm of their hands in their phones at that time buddy.

Because in their times no one else knew better. Now we do know better.

Because it's 2025

Where are these comments

Don't argue with these guys bro, everybody who knows Kamakoti sir understands that he will never give this type of controversial statement without any supportive evidence.

All papers talk about lab tests, none of it is a human trail. 

If you use harpic in labs it can also kill bacteria, can you ask people to drink harpic because of that? 

He claims people were cured from diseases because of drinking urine and showed lap test papers, NOT HUMAN TRAILS. zero logic.

[removed]

Wow , the same was said about rasam being cure for corona and later disproved. These guys are just peddling bullshit and the publications are not even remotely standard. Yet if you believe go ahead and gulp it or even better make a brand like Amul for cow urine along with your visionary professor.

Dickriding is insane

I value the nation, and the idea of the republic it represents. That is why I'm calling this out.

LONG LIVE THE REPUBLIC!

Your arguments are as informative, as your grammar is coherent.

I checked and information about him is limited to only the far right news websites(which i'm not interested in clicking on)

\>Although it was patented by Americans, it is originally a gift from India itself.

What was patented by americans?

How is tulsi related to any of this?

Bro just google it. How does it fit a person inside it?

[deleted]

It is to be distilled and prepared in a specific way. If you eat vegetables straight from the market without cleaning and cooking that will also cause problems, so based on that will you conclude that vegetables are dangerous and not something to eat??

Hell nahhh bro really pulled up with this 😭😭😭

sorry bro , khud ka upvote bhi nahi dikhega

Have you eaten honey? Then don't because that is bee vomit.

We found your post/comment irrelevant in it's current state. In case you have an update, please feel free to post again. Please mind that spamming something 3 or more times may result in a ban.

There is a difference between using medical institutes to research medicine and technology institutes to research medicine.

This guy has nothing to with science... He is just a Dravidian agenda peddler.

Two of the most famous doctors have debunked it, if you still can't believe, nothing i can do. Drink and post q video for us

Exactly bro, the research is not carried out by a healthcare university, rather a university dedicated to technology, wants to carry out this

Veterinary University has done multiple research on this and published.

The difference is that they have been doing research through medical Universities and we are doing the research through Technology university.

Then how are you better? We need individual efforts to progress the country. Unfortunately, people say things like these to display their "love for nation", however, it's quite the opposite! 

You mentioned about getting rich right? Where is that wealth coming from? It's coming from India's Capital Reserve. You are collecting resources from poor people of India, you are collecting money from the Government, you're collecting money from India's companies. And, then you are taking the whole outside : somewhere else abroad...

What would you do that with that money? Will you invent a revolutionary technology? Smart hardworking people of India are feeding upon India's resources and laying the eggs on a foreign land.. Then how will the country grow? 

Since independence, India has never been in a trade surplus, we are already losing money to outsiders! The bare minimum it has... It is spent after maintaining low cost healthcare, education, transport etc. This means the government is constantly spending so that the poor can have their lives easier.. And when that poor man's son gets educated, earns skills (fuelling on the country's dwindling capital reserve!) he dreams of leaving the country so that he can have a Lenient and Sumptuous lifestyle! So that he can lend money to the foreign companies.. Just to relish resplendent supplies? 

This is why the country is not growing bro.. This is EXACTLY, why India is not growing.. And it will never grow even in the next 50 years!

No theist beliefs systems were hurt here!

In our society science will never prevail

*sense

Says who 😂😂😂. IITian ho to kya pehle accha insaan bano

Truly rational person wouldn't want to waste money on this bs.

Ek aur mil gaya gaumutra peene waala 🤣🤣

Atleast such things are not passed to next generations. They will be the last generation to believe in such.

distillation? that makes it pure water?

Veda* Yajurveda mentions beef being prepared for and offered to guests, while Rigveda mentions cows as noble. Hence, the clusterfuck.

Do you think Indians don't die of totally presentable diseases, to this day? India's lifespan is terribly low, and protein deficiency - as a result of blind religiosity- is one of the biggest contributors.

Even within India, states that eat more meat have better health indicators.

You realise a lot of Indians also have nut allergies …. Not to mention things like lactose intolerance and severe dust and pollen allergies ? Not every gora has an allergy, just as not every Indian has an allergy….

Chill. I was just extending the joke. Ofc it's not nuanced.

crazy inferiority complex

It’s definitely meat and high protein diets over generations. Those warriors you talk of didn’t just get big because they were fighting 24x7 or something. Their colder climates meant less agriculture and more meat based diets which means higher proteins.

It’s the Neanderthal DNA

Yes?

Einstein was wrong about Quantum mechanics - which is a branch of science. This dude is wrong about cow urine - which is a belief based on religion. That's the difference here my friend. It's a double whammy - it encourages baseless unscientific debate, as well as is a small yet continuous attempt of destroying religious harmony. Imagine the uproar had a Muslim professor said something like this for a tabeez, etc.

You're right. 

Except, that's not called a logical fallacy 😁

lol 😂

So can Alcohol, consuming either is a personal choice you make.

Also, a lot of consumer grade cow urine beverages are marked as fit for consumption by the public as per the Health Ministry.

I don't think it's elixir, but if someone believes it is, it's their private privelage to excercise that belief if it's not illegal.

If you ate vegetables raw from the market, without washing or cooking it, that also contains harmful bacteria and e coli. That doesn't mean vegetables themselves are harmful, you need to process it correctly. The consumer grade Ayurvedic products are processed and distilled forms. Also, there are many research papers which talk about it's benefits which is what he shared so it is very clear he meant it in the distilled form. Media selectively picking clickbait titles and quoting out of context is the problem.

neeche likha hai logo ne scroll kr

You are absolutely right, anyone who has met him personally knows the man is a gem! People are intentionally quoting him out of context and in fact totally false accusations too. OP has posted this same (incorrect accusations) in multiple subs, whether for karma farming or for propaganda is unclear. He is presenting it as if only China is doing research and India is doing nothing. In IIT-M itself there are multiple incubated startups researching these fields in OP's pic. In fact, ePlane is an IIT-M incubated startup which is the first in India to get DGCA license for eVTOL air taxi. The data science and electronic systems program is literally the first step to democratizing quality higher education to anyone in India. Recently, IIT-M has accepted 5 students under the sports quota which is the first for any IIT in India. Then you have the Shakti RISC-V microprocessor. Kamakoti sir has spearheaded all of this. Plus the consecutive #1 rankings in NIRF. These guys don't know anything

Then what's the problem if he invites people to come and do research on this topic? Your post and comments are contradictory.

It is part of the Nature group and it is a Q1 journal.

The real people who are profiting off of this crazy situation are the people who are selling Cow urine, who knows they probably are also the ones who keep spreading cow urine propaganda

Please do recheck 🥲

That's a whole ass person

Here's the thing. Ayurveda works too.

Its impossible to win an argument against a ignorant ahh person.

No, honey is not bee vomit. Instead, honey is made from nectar that bees collect from flowers and store in a special stomach called the "honey stomach". Explanation

* Bees use their long proboscis to suck nectar from flowers. 

* The nectar is pumped into the bee's honey stomach through its tongue. 
* The honey stomach is separate from the bee's true stomach. 
* The bee's organs turn the nectar into honey. 
* The dehydration process is the most time-consuming step in converting nectar to honey. 

not really

Ok I wont, now stop drinking pee please.

Honey is used in feeding their Larvaes and themselves too, It's like storing their food for later use, You expect a bug to make a carry bag to carry their food ?

You are just changing goalpost now. There are departments of Biotech and chemistry in IITs. Even medical science and Technology.... And even Humanities.

There are departments of medical science, biotech and chemistry in IITs.

Bro iam literally broke for now.....I just said it for fun man.....even though I love this country the rich traditions where I will never get it from any other country I was just being sarcasm to the iit director...

Huh the wealth is coming from my hard-work man where this govt loots the every middle-class people in the name of the tax...I don't care the wealth is coming from the capital reserve or not I do the work I get paid ....also i do care about the country not a. Country with so much corruptions..

And also I know that you have the knowledge on these topics and sorry for my lack of it I may have said more than I should... I would also like to help the country to grow and I know what the individual efforts makes the progress of the country, as a student and looking at all these colleges where our education system's are moving in a very money making direction rather than providing the quality education i don't think this country's gonna surpass any other developed countries 

This is my perspective......
If there is anything inhave said wrong please correct me....

Pseudo-rationalists patting themselves on the back for their ignorance is a tale as old as time

Common and civiv

Omg , you caught me ... yelo beta oscar... btw what i said was let there be a research and truth come out .. thats scientific way. Just ignoring it because it sounds crazy is not science

[deleted]

Can you expand on this, I have heard beef offerings but I could never use it as an argument because I hadn't read the source backing it.

It is because of individual neglect most of the time... people just don't think that we should eat good food etc etc...in tier 3 cities and in villages people just eat whatever they get, they would rather buy a piece of land than eat more protein...this has something to do with their mindset majorly which can't be changed at once...it will take a lot of time.

Sure in india these so called meat eating states like kerela, tamil nadu, karnataka had the first and also the worst no of cases of Covid 19 and majorly all the latest flu's. Look at the data all these diseases start from those states and the number of the cases is also highest throughout the nation

Well, I could argue that natural selection worked there, smaller weaker people got killed a lot more than taller and stronger ones.

Why generations? Indian kids born abroad are just as tall as white kids

I was trying to counter his 
Newton believed in alchemy point

>Einstein was wrong about Quantum mechanics - which is a branch of science

New finding? Different interpretation, not wrong. Einstein got nobel for explaining the photoelectric effect with duality of photons which is the core of quantum mechanics.

lol how they mark consumer grade cow urine fit for drinking ? Infact many indian researcher themselves prove that it is harmful and unfit...it may contain E. Coli bacteria along with possibility of heavy metals and pathogens..On repetitive drinking it will give more harm than benfits 😂

I mean, You're not TOTALLY wrong, but they should exercise their rights silently then? Wouldn't such statements lead on desperate people with health crisis who actually need real medicine to be cured, to believe that guzzling bovine urine can cure their cancer/fever/etc?

I, personally, do not believe in any benefits of this, but respect other's decisions and rights. But keep it to your own self. This is like vegans with the stereotypical superiority complex.

Bro he is not a doctor to do research on this. As an engineer, I'll claim harpic cures Cancer and then ask people to drink as part of the test. Will it be justified.

Am I expected to work on ML models or harpic 

IIT is a technology institute, paid by tax money. If should research tech.

[removed]

There is a difference between processed/distilled vs raw. No one is saying to consume it raw. Few years down the lane these same doctors will be praising it when new research emerges. They only have knowledge about allopathy and not Ayurveda.

Apparently the irony of you saying this is lost on you

How many medical patterns and human trails have been completed?

Can you do a quick research for me, at the time of Covid where these departments work on devices to detect Covid, instruments for labs to test Covid-19 samples or where they are working on vaccines and medicines for Covid. 

Be rational, do you really think that people can drink cow urine?

It's same.. I am poor also, but these things are just my observations, so I said. 

Similarly I personally believe that It's probably better to store your money in the hands of the government than to give it to Ambani Adani. Imagine, what would happen if government wouldn't subsidise fuel.. You would need to pay more which would entirely be accumulated in the hands of the big companies! 

That's why paying taxes is not that bad! But yes.. This is right that the country is rotten to near demise! 
People here have no harmony and unity! That's why corruption still prevails It it will never ever change, 100% sure. Even 50-100 years down the line, the condition is not going to improve much.. Mark my words!

paisa ped pe nahi ugta, aap dedo funding pls, don't use tax payers money

Bruh wtf is this serious or cooked up story... Well you're young age ...and your parents are older that's might be the reason for thier covid infection. Difference ig

had covid twice after that didn't feel anything you've have strong immunity that's all

Urine is usually sterile and mostly water. No one ever dies of drinking urine. Not defending. You can try drinking your own urine. Aside from the taste and nausea due to the thought process of drinking urine. You would probably be fine

Nah bro the cow urine definitely affected you 

You can read your comments once again if you doubt that

No. It's because of blind religiosity and pseudoscientific purity culture that elevates carb-rich, greasy vegetarian trash, above nutritious food.

The healthiest populations in the world are all voracious meat eaters.

The vegetarian dominant states have the worst maternal mortality, infant mortality rate, and premature births. Kerala's lifespan is above USA, while Gujarat's is slightly better than Nepal.

>Sure in india these so called meat eating states like kerela, tamil nadu, karnataka had the first and also the worst no of cases of Covid 19 and majorly all the latest flu's.

Source? You're shamelessly lying.

Maybe maybe Mr Knob head that covid 19s cases were discovered first there because people there are more educated and more likely to fly outside?

Dude , Covid 19 cases in Kerala were high not because they ate meat …. It’s because of a high number of travelers that travelled back and forth from various countries to Kerala , it records one of the highest number of Indians travelling abroad. Tamil Nadu has the highest number of international travellers in India. 
The other reason for high number of recorded cases in Kerala is the fact that they took Covid testing very seriously and could do it effectively due to a good statewide hospital infrastructure, while people in other parts of the country refused to even acknowledge the wide presence of Covid 19.
At least get your facts straight …. 
Karnataka shares a border with both Tamil Nadu and Kerala and also has a large population of people travelling between the states , hence the increased Covid cases there.

To some extent maybe. But, if we consider the case of south korea and north korea the impact of income and food becomes clearer. 

South Korean men have an average height of 174 cm while the North Korean men have an average height of 165 cm. 

Vox did an article on this ( Are humans getting taller? | Vox )

I was gonna comment that how exactly he was wrong about qm he actually proved the duality of matter

> *give more harm than benefits*

What in the hell could be a benefit of drinking urine other than population control !?🤷‍♂️

The research you are talking about is completely raw, not distilled and not processed. It is not the same as the one which is used in Ayurvedic medications after pre-processing. In fact, the report from IVRI that is going around, if people just bothered to scroll to the bottom of the article they would have found that IVRI themselves have backed it (the processed consumer grade one). If you eat raw vegetables straight from the market, without cleaning or cooking, that also contains harmful bacteria and e coli. That doesn't mean vegetables themselves are harmful.

Clearly you are not a IITian, not sure what you are doing in this sub. No point engaging further with you.

It has an IF of 3.8 now, it was 5 when the study was published in 2021. Having a low impact factor is because of the varying fields of the publications in it which have wildly different citation rates. Something like this for example, could not possibly compare to the citations for a field like AI or physics. It may not be the top tier, but that does not make it a predatory journal like some are claiming it to be. And it is still Q1 which is trustworthy enough.

Issokay bro, don't mind em, you drink cow peepee and poopoo. Darwin bless you

Again goalpost changing. Get a life.

[deleted]

What doesn't kill you , makes you piss drinker.

you may right , but there is no strong backing or research, most of them are upper level study...if cow urine is fit and usefull for drinking , i bet then horse urine will be best as their blood serums are used in antidote making haha ask govt to sell that also, or they are interested only because of religious reasons 😂

That's the basic things and common sence.
Cleaning vegetables is removing bacteria that is present on the vegetable and the part of it. 

If We consider your point that means we can drink poision by adding mineral water into it.

Sanghi rotten brains in IITs are even more dangerous than Nukes pakistan possesses.

🤣🤣

Hmm 39 is still old dude I read in articles that toddler , mid aged and old aged are got infected alot unlike early teens and 20's aren't much ...also death was only high in mid age and old age ...rest all mostly got cured and returned. That's why I can't able to believe it's cow piss that boosted your immunity... You had already immunity. And maybe practiced good hygiene with mask and less roaming on streets. Anyway as you said yeah one spoon of filtered won't get you into dysentery...it needs bateria and fecal materials to affect the body

Hope you won't drink in future and say no to your dad's compulsion

Paratha and yellow liquid

its definitely that dono ka as such kuch correlation nhi h logo me mut pine ka kink kbse aya pta nhi I would prefer beer than piss

Title: Ye kya hai 😂...

Mera dusra iit frnds ye wala pic send karke puch rahe hai ..

I know of a 100 different ways to die without a ceiling fan.

So they are installing ACs instead?

[deleted]

Pankha nhi to garmi se marjaega insan, good initiative!

It's interesting to see how one of the best institute of the country is taking stupid decision

Yep 
Fan was the issue😂😂

छत kaise remove karenge yeh log

How is the idea of jumping from the rooftop of SBP

"Even then, it is not our fault, we will not take responsibility, we will not pay for student's metal welfare, we will not be lax with our rules, we will continue this fatherless behavior till the next su\*cide happens. " - IIT Kharagpur

Nah, it's a clickbaity title, they are exploring having springs in fans:

What kind of heartless monsters someone has to be to remove fans like do they want their students to die in this heat? I smell a massive protest incoming

Next step… all buildings will only have ground floors to prevent students committing suicide by jumping off the roof

Basically, they are going to convert all the old halls into SBP type

Kuch nahi AC lagwa ke fees zyada lenge baccho se

it is so difficult to listen to the high IQ level people in IIT to make arrangements for professional help.They cannot keep a clinical phycologist for professional help.Sallute to their high IQ to for steps taken to prevent sucide..

Are bilkul kota ki yaad aagyi. Even the government of rajasthan passed the order previous year to add spring in every fan and nets on rooftop.........

Pankhe nikaalenge haalat acche nahi karenge

Absolutely they are iitian they will discover new method of dying. Don't underestimate them.😂

yeah like hanging from fans are the only way to commit suicide. what a stupid move

Or is it bec a ceiling fan fell on a guy in BRH

Yes ceilingfans lure students saying "aja raja ln pkd k jhuul ja"

16k bache kaha se aagye iitkgp me😭

Now people will die en masse of heat

Jaise padhne wale kahin bhi padhlete hain similarly marne wale kahin bhi marlete hain 😊

Bc iit kgp me select hoke kon marta h

Bhai Zeher kha lenge tab kya karoge?

Next electricity bhi nikalenge

Here at IIT Goa, due to an unfortunate suicide last year, they replaced all fans with Suicide proof fans, which have a spring loaded that deploy upon excessive force

This is technically not feasible.
Older halls like PAN do not have a wiring system which can tolerate high voltage appliances.
Even earthing is not proper. Even HMC sometimes suggests removing the laptop charger adapter from plugs during rain.
Having duct air would even be more costlier and not feasible.

Its called progress 🤡

Itne hushaar log india ke top college chala rahe. Wah

Iit students are smart.. they’ll figure out a way ..

Iitian ho saalo halka fan bnao jo bi latkega mar ni paayega insteda gir jayega

So what will students do in summer? Are they going to provide AC now to everyone?

Fix the curriculum and the entrance process I guess?

Yes celling fans were the reason for suicide. Top notch minds handling IIT kgp right now

Authorities think fans are the issue. What a clown state of affairs 🤡.
We’re doomed!

cost cutting ka bhadiya tareeka hai

Don't be a minimum guy

AC lagao students ki jaan bachao

So now more students will die of heatstroke

Sundar Pichai will be proud of his alma mater!!

Suicide ke liye nhi kar rahe, naye pankhe lagane nhi padenge aur in purane pankho ko kabadi mai bech ke powri karenge.

Next, they r gonna remove gravity...

[Rakhi Sawant proposed this long ago](

And then give AC rooms right? ..... Right?

Ab pankhe se marne ke bajae garmi se mar jaenge😂

From campus mothers to fan removal , IIT came a long way

So instead of helping the students, they are finding ways to prevent students from unaliving?

An apt example of addressing symptoms instead of the underlying disease.

Miss you Jagan movayyaaaaaa😭😭

not being offensive but there is still a 5+ floor tall buildings... left i don't know why they always make stupid decisions instead of stopping the root cause. i used to go to college they say no bullying and yet they let people of reservations casts to Bully us... for money for occasion and festivals though we can't afford and also these so called reservation people don't have to pay a penny...

Why do students actually end their lives What's the point idk after reaching that much peak ?

Where there is a will, there is a way.

mae balcony se kud jaunga

What will they do next , remove floors from hostels and keep only the ground floor , to avoid students jumping from the terrace

Mind you these are some of the smartest (Academically) people in our country .

Rakhi Sawant said it first

Visionary

Next make the buildings 2 floor high

Garmi mai bache aur maj jaaenge

AC laga rahe kya? Us se maybe kam ho jaye

May be they think fans is what appeals them or hypnotizes them for suicide...pls root cause naam ka bhi ek cheez hoti h ...

Do they think that students look at fans and think 'I have this urge to hang myself' or what!

System nahi balenge thoda... pankha ukhadenge

Terrace sales 📈📈📈

Ceiling hi hata do.

aab baache chaate se kud rhe h kyuki garmi boht h /jk

Fan nikalenge....but reasons ka kuch nahi hoga ..... KGP ka sanskaar change nahi hoga

Marne waale kahi bhi mar lete hai

Let me grab my book..📝✍️....

97 wala bataana

What are those

Dream big but not this big

Paper fans

You guys are getting 1 egg(MMM here)..

And jerking twice a day.

There are 18yo males too 😢

Jo Zinda rehne wala tha vo bhi tapak jayega

See that's where you're wrong, it's not one of the best in the country

Rooms in Nalanda would still have fans lol

Restricitng entry

They will add trampolines in every hall 😂

"we will send mail to all members paying condolences to him"..... that's the only thing they done🫠

SBP has ac how will they convert lmao

Marne wale kahi bhi marlete hai

Kahi suna suna lg rha h

Goated comment 💀

This is the funniest thing I've read on the internet today lmao.

Hey Kira

it isn't?

IIT Kharagpur comes in top 7 IITs right...

Marne ko padhne se replace karo

Nah, even profs are leaving to go teach in IIT Hyderabad. Quality is dropping off real fast.

It's stuck in history. Profs have 0 inclination towards any meaningful research. Placement stats are dropping. Idk what to make of it anymore, I feel like having wasted 4 entire years suffering here.

Padhne vale kahi bhi mar jate h

konse dep ke? mere wale ke to yahi hain..

humare profs kyun nhi ja rhe hain

Ha yahi tha 😭

Sirf acche profs hi jaa rahe hai anyway, koi fayda nahi hai hope karne ka

Got downvoted to hell when I commented "Lawda insti, lawde log" on some other post. 
My friend also got his phone stolen in a similar way on the last endsem of 6th sem.... Someone else got money stolen from their room during sf.... Some people used to call me paranoid for locking my room even for going to mess, not taking phone with me during endsem... Lawde log bhare pade hai idhar

Mera toh naya sutte ke dabba le gaya tha koi

such a disgrace !

Wtf is this crazy lore

Extortion

The same thing happened to a guy in my class, miserable ppl 😔

file police complaint, they will very easily, very very easily, nab this person down. this case is a cake walk for cyber cell. pls do file complaint as this may put a full stop on such crimes happening in campus (as mentioned in the comments). i believe trust in the campus should be 100%.. students cant live in a state of fear.

What tf ? IITian chor nikl rhe ab. Bas yhi rh gya tha baki sb th kr hi chuke h engineers. Ab IIT me bhi yh chori chakari hogi th kya rh gya bc.

When you get a seat through reservation

how did you get it back?

Is there any CCTV in that area?

Did you complain to the police?

My friend too lost his airpods from his bag which was literally in our department

I had lost my phone + bag from the main building auditoriums during exams last year. Went to police, filed a report and everything. Absolutely nothing came of it. There are zero cameras in the main building (2 point to the gate for vehicle entry and 1 points to the exam control room). Please be careful during exams.

lmao what the actual fuck

File a police complaint, this is pushing it too far.

isiliye ameer private college jana chahiye tha /s

Bro is trading, ain't nothing wrong.

Tumhare colleges me cctv nahi hai kya?
Apart from that you don't need to worry about someone's carrer, choices have consequences make them know that, go ahead with complaint to every official of college check cctv's file an fir/cybercell as well as anti-ragging committee by calling them on the helpline number, get the whole college into inspection and do it quietly not after announcing it even to your own faculties.

Bro should have used temp mail or proton mail , he is using Gmail...

Please file a complain even if you got your phone back, people like these won't stop unless they face consequences.

Ye koi tarika hai bheekh mangne ka

At least they saw you crying and had frickin mercy 😭😭😭 More like they got scared they might get caught

Cctv check krwao

I can't tell if this is because the comment section is full of STEM people and they don't know how police works, or some of them have seen too many Law and Order episodes. Either way, some of you need to get a reality check of how mobile phone cases are handled: they aren't.

He's Professor McGonagall

4th year hai voh.

Uska shayad placement nahi laga hoga

education has no species boundary 😠😠

What wonderous purpose does the canine serve in the sholarly assessment chamber?

Are you an invigilator? How did you take photo during exam?

The Doggo is one of the invigilators who only want chai, biscuit and AC

CAT aspirant

He might be helping someone with the answers. Ratatouille ❌️ Dogatouille ✅️

Let him chill bro..

Bhai jo pic le raha hai usse puchna padega

He is probably thinking ki acha hai mereko exam nahi dena parta.

Btw exam hall me ye photo kon le liya?

Tune toh sirf IIT join Kiya...wo paida hi wahi hua tha

it's not what you think, those dogs are not your average street dogs, those are highly domesticated, vaccinated, regularly cleaned and fed dogs that roam around the campus. Many people like myself often play with them, they are great stress relievers especially after things like examinations. We at IIT Guwahati have a similar system. And we have Cats too...

He's the "watchdog"

He is the Yawn Specialist. He is not the doggesh bhai we want , but he the doggesh bhai we need.

bro is invigilating

He aced in the iit better than humans

He is probably thinking that " yha aane ke liye log marte h" 🥱🥱

What the dog doin?

He's the guest invigilator 😭

Maybe Dogs and Indians are allowed

What that dog doinin here ahh picture

What da dawg doin?!?

If someone wants to use the" dog bite his or her paper" excuse

Youll see such semi strays in every colleges especially govt colleges where students pet feed them, the buildings are their homes, often during summers they take shelter in classrooms, i remember we had a dog called Alpha he was there since almost 10 years.

If there's a dog in the room, I will not be passing that for sure. 
Also I've failed because I was too sensitive that day.

maybe some jee aspirant who died and reincarnated as a dog to experience iit life

Aur 8 se 11 baje tak to tu mobile hi dikhega...

Pure din me 1 hr 5 min ke study🤣🤣🤣

No class this sem less gooo🦅🐐

\> wake up

\> nun-chai

mera last sem isse bhi tight rakha tha time table, 10 ke as pas a to gye lekin summer me burnout ho gya

12:30am -2:30am -> JCB/ bandi time

2:30-4:30 -> reels scrolling

The life we don't deserve

What is Nun Chai? I don't think this is salt tea? That sounds disgusting.

Slow down my boy, you're studying too much, your brain will melt 🫠

You are studying too much. Consider taking breaks and resting.

8 to 9 am wala thoda ache se explain kariye ek baar

😂😂

Most honest time table. You sure got some balls to post you legit schedule even after being aware that you're gonna be trolled 😅

LMaooooooooo legit at the start of every sem

Noice

jab tak fix schedule me muthi add nhi hogi, tab tak dassi nahi bajegi

Was ist nun chai ?

i think wo bich bich “study” se flow disturb hoga💀

Waah bete waah, mauj kardi

Bhai is waking up for nun-chai + makai sattu😂
OP Bhai OP

You will get A+++ Grade.

Bhai tu uthne ke baad fir q aaram karne jara

Thanku for adding short study breaks in between of ur busy schedule 🥰🙏

What OP sees at 6:30 am and 5:00 pm :

I'm not kidding this is way more than enough for 10 CG.

wow

All the best

I thought it was something serious until I saw the duration of each study 🤡🤣

You have allocated a lot of time for studying. reduce it and move that time elsewhere

Bhai college mai hai tu? College mai yeh Saab ni karte, jab entrance exams Dera tha tab karna tha yeh saab. Aab hostel mai party maar, phadai kar, game khel, dosto ke sath ghum.

Mene yeh saab Kia aur mai topper tha 😂😂😂.

Shaam k 6 baje 3hrs ki rest kyu chahiye 😭 

Wo bhi 3 ghante so k baad

add backshots from proff each day from 0700 to 0800 each day

gooning kab karoge??

Hectic hai thora but I'm sure you'll do it

Bhai, advice du toh very inefficient time table 

Woh beech mein thodi unnecessary cheeze daal di tune, like rest soon after waking up, or 3 hrs for afternoon nap, also too much studying going on, replace all with web series/youtube and it will give you the best ROI

Koi doraemon wala meme post karo

Title: Just got bit yo

Was running on 2.2, this dog charges me, unprovoked, and bites me.

I know little will change but I wish to put it out here. At BC Roy atm. Cheers.

I think i saw u at bc roy today

Get vaccinated ASAP

Hope u are okay now OP. 

These dogs are just a fucking menace. Can't run peacefully, Can't go for late night walks, Can't cycle at night cause they will chase you. And the authorities are least concerned!!!

Ye bkl same jagah pe mere piche bhi padha hai along with 2 of his rabid pals. Managed to hit him so hard ki wapas aya nhi kabhi piche fir.

But SNVH wale kutte was also a major reason ki I stopped going for the 2.2 and started running near the agri fields instead. Can't even remove them kyuki idk whats worse, getting the rabies vaccine ya fir trying to argue those dumbfuck activist aunties who dont let you remove them.

Bite him and assert dominance

According to this email sent by hp of SNVH on 4th August, all the dogs should be inside the barricade after 5 pm! What's up with that?

Dog lovers réponse roulette- 
“Tumne hee kuch kiya hoga.”
“Dogs aise hee nahi kaat te”
“You’re lying, looks like such a sweet dog”
“It’s your fault, why you crossing its path”

The dog is going though tough times 😔💔🥀
Feed him chocolate it might make him happy 🧠🔥

Feed it chocolate

Take the Rabies vaccine.

[ Removed by Reddit ]

Bite him back

Then some people compare it to cows and children on the street. What kind of crazy whataboutsim is that!

Rabies and TT lagao

If you got bitten, hold both of their legs and spin in the air and throw 15m away

Pee and mark your territory.

Bro made this account just to tell he got bit by a dog. ( hope you recover)

Abb kahan gaye कुत्तेचोदक(dog lovers)?

So sad, man! 😟

Visit nearby qualified hospital at the earliest and take necessary vaccination.

As a precautionary measure, consider carrying a portable, extending steel stick to keep you safe from any stray dogs you might encounter. It's always better to be safe than sorry, and this simple tool can provide added protection and support.

These dogs should be either trained properly or removed from campus. There can be no inbetween. Safety > love

I'm happy SC took the decision to clean the streets off dogs, I just hope that they implement it everywhere

At exactly which place ?😞

Please check dm

your username, lmfao

OP, keep posting about these dogs related incidents. Don't let this gr8 username go in vain.

Assert dominance, bite it back.

You need to run faster :) 

sorry u got bit.

Treat him w some chocolate

Say hello to rabies..

GetHuman Rabies Immunoglobulin (HRIG) vaccination as well. The dog doesnt look right by the way it's panting

Get rabies vaccine . Hope u are doing good

Dog lovers: it is your mistake. It sure dog is ok now. I’m sad that you didn’t die

[deleted]

I saw them chasing a guy riding his bicycle yesterday…there were security guards near ccd, not near this spot.

looks can indeed be deceiving

hope you recover soon bhai

Walking and running are wrong bro you're supposed to fly when you see these angel babies.

I know this dog. Quite friendly and a nice guy. Been friends with him on discord. Take care dawg. One can only say that you be careful. These mofo streets ain't for nobody these days.

Oh you poor thing. I hope you get well soon 😊

Fight for survival bro

Get your shorts asap , and also get a TT , and invest in a pepper spray

It's mostly rabid; early phase of contagious stage (excessive salivation; aggresion, etc.)

GET A RABIES VACCINE IMMEDIATELY.

OP's anger can be seen in the username

Go get a rabies vaccine shot yo

That body language screams Rabies

remove them from everywhere

Atleast attach photos of the bite so no one can argue that this is just a troll post

And ppl call these bastards their kids

Keep pepper spray with you next time

OP you're gonna be on my prayer list, I hope you recover asap you didn't deserve this shit

I wonder what it feels like..it's one of my nightmares

So, you stayed there and made a video of the dogs? Such a made up story...

Why are you running?
Its india where there's no pedestrians path, no rules , either a scooter or bike will hit you or these dogs

How many shots did you doctor told you should get. I got bitten 2 times and both times the doctor only have 1 shot on the shoulder.

Do you happen to be a 2nd year and a strategist at kgts

let's meet tomorrow at some place to discuss this. this is going out of hand. we need to do something

Hmm idk what’s worse, the ignorance of the people in the comments or the ignorance of the government, I feel for you OP but seeing the comments makes me sad how humans who are supposed to be the most intelligent beings of the universe fail to understand that dogs or any animal for that matter doesn’t harm someone if they haven’t had a traumatic past or provoked. Giving you the benefit of doubt that you didn’t do anything to provoke him, you did not deserve this. But it’s sad seeing people failing to understand that getting these dogs vaccinated and sheltered is the solution not ending their life

Btw wth is "2.2"?🤔🙏🏻

that dogs probably worth more than you are ngl

Deserved

It’s quite sad that he bite you. Take the rabies injection.

Tbh this dog seems abused in the past which is why probably this behaviour.

Most likely, yes

A bit unlucky, and OP would be seeing BC Roy. /s

Please educate yourself on how rabid dogs can't eat. Kya pata thoda padh loge to pass bhi ho jaoge waise to cgpa hi bkl hai tumhare

Most possibly the dog will die

Can you mail them again or something that this has happened again?

Why even feed the dogs?
Let them die of hunger

Canine distemper...that dancing dog thing?? Should take over them and let them die of dancing. Fuck yaar, they are cute enemies, and enemies are enemies!!!!!! 🤺🤺

Its works on human bro, what are dogs. But I don't recommend killing of dogs, authorities should take action. Maybe call a teachers meeting near that place and let that do bite teacher or higher ups only then will they understand.

How r u now?

It's dangerous for them cuz theobromine and caffeine.

Glad to hear that you have vaccinated , now in India if you go on Amazon you'll find a lot of pepper sprays , most of them are shit , and for some reason are marketed only towards women , like I said most pepper sprays are shit , here is a video comparing all of em 

Now out of all of these there is only one that works well ( time stamp 15:02 ) 

Here is the link to the product 

Remember to use it as a last resort first try scaring away the dog , and if that doesn't work or they are in large numbers point it as far away from your face as possible use it in small bursts as dogs as dogs have a sensitive nose . Stay safe and don't miss any of your shorts .

glad to hear that ❤️

I also agree, he needs help and staying in campus will probably make things worse for him

Authorities?? If they don't do anything we'll have to take action for our protection

Yeah until they experience pain they don't understand pain.To understand it you need to experience pain.I am pain

Thankfully our country has some morals still left.

What they do, do you think is right?

So, did he receive any email Poulomi?

Yeah there aren't enough shelters,but I wonder how far , unless its somewhere as far as Nagaland ,the dogs will come back

13?

5 (if deep wound) otherwise 4 is standard these days

Aye stop spreading misinformation. It’s 4 usually
In rare cases 5.
Let the doctor decide.

I took rabies vaccine, it is usually just ARG and no RIG when its low risk animal or not bleeding (Category 1 or 2 exposure), RIG when you bleed and there is exposure to saliva. RIG (usually HRIG is preferred and you should take HRIG too in case...) on Day 0 near the site of exposure basically kills all rabies by providing instant antibodies of other humans (ERIG are basically antibodies of horses, cheaper and more available but requires allergy test and has side effects, HRIG does not have side effects but is expensive so I suggest HRIG). And they only give you vax on Day 0 (in case Category 3 exposure) + Tetanus shot + ARV and then ARV on Day 3, 4, 7, 14 and 28 (28 is optional tho but complete your dosage), no 13 shots. And they give you vax near shoulders or arm, not butt or thighs

Much better!

how about cyanide biscuit?

Bro that means our government is showing negligence and unserious of a common man life, I have seen videos of dogs killing  baby,biting humans and hydrophiia rabies patients that feels worse than death. Think about human suffering and this dogs are also souls but you need to discriminate here, and as apex predator it's your wish to forgive or make it lifeless

What morals man , The dog has bitten a person , Should've been killed , No morality here .

Used to be. IIRC now its 7.

Humanity lives through them I guess

I understand from where you are coming from.

But There is no simple answer here.

You just cannot butcher a species because it is causing problem to you which btw again is a controversial thing in philosophy.

So, Think maturely…There would always be a way to co-exist.

Morally Try to think, You’ll understand how wrong it is.

There is a nice saying about this

“Eye for a eye makes the whole world blind”

Also, Dog doesn’t bite just randomly…there is always a past involved which is generally a abusive past caused by none other than humans.

So, technically first you abused it and when it retaliated, you saying its such a bad dog and should be killed.

Lol..teri iq se to lag rha tu to campus me bhi nhi thi. Average Kharagpur Women's college nibbi lurking in IIT campus. Fuck off.

Yeah bullshit , Dog bites dog gets blown to kingdom come , the guy clearly did nothing to the rabid mutt , still it bit him , Nothing justifies the biting of people by a dog , except maybe for self defense .

it's 4.

HELL YEAHHH

Now uncle became rabid.. jali na Teri .. mast !!

You really need to understand about dog and dog behaviour So, then you might be able to better understand.

Right now I don’t think you understand dog psychology.

It's more if u take booster shots

Ek Pagal kutiya padh gayi na piche faltu me kyuki

You have to take 5 doses and the schedule is 0, 3, 7, 14 and 28th day. And it's 7 in total if u include booster doses which further improve immunity for an extra 2 years. I don't think you're safe with just 4 doses, consult a doc asap. Which day's dose did u miss?

I got bit too recently and took only 4 injections, am I safe?

Haha.. itni asaani se jal jata hai tu to.

Title: CodeClub IIT KGP just embarrassed the whole college on Codeforces

Recently, CodeClub from IIT Kharagpur hosted a “prestigious” Codeforces contest. You’d expect a well-organized event that reflects the coding culture of one of India’s top institutes.

But what actually happened? A ranklist full of newbies magically solving every problem — people who usually struggle with Div 2 A were suddenly performing like LGMs. Peak character development, I guess.

And while all this “miraculous growth” was unfolding, not a single Master, CM, or GM bothered to give the contest. 

It’s honestly pathetic. The club that’s supposed to represent KGP’s CP scene ended up exposing how little they care about fairness or actual skill. Instead of building credibility, they just handed the community a reason to laugh at us.

And let’s be real — some of those submissions were so suspiciously fast and accurate, it felt less like a contest and more like a synchronized solution reveal. 

Good job, CodeClub. You didn’t just mess up a contest — you made sure everyone remembers IIT KGP for all the wrong reasons. Shame

"placement season is coming please dont make bad impression of my profile"🤡

the worst part is he isnt guilty of cheating but justifying his prompting skills

"The club that’s supposed to represent KGP’s CP scene ended up exposing how little they care about fairness or actual skill. " 
CP here without fullform is so damn funny out of context

Interesting

I took the contest and to be honest the problems were a little unusual but they certainly weren't bad per se (except maybe problem A). B was really hard in some sense the logic works without considering two balls can hit eachother but why does it work is hard to prove, by considering test cases it is possible to find the answer. I was close to solving C (found the answer bound for working m but couldn't find the construction of the graph within the time limit). 
I can usually solve div2 B's and I performed as expected (additionally with some good progress in C). 

People are hating because:

1) The flavour-text of problems are kind of annoying

2) Solutions are easily found by gpt apparently (B and D had an insane amount of solves in very less time)

3) The organizers were not very high rated.

4) The problems were certainly not your usual cp problems.

5) There are suspicions that solutions have been leaked.

Some amount of hate is justified but remember this isn't just portraying KGP's image itself but rather the whole of India. If you read the comments you'll know what I mean. I'm not really sure if only blaming the organizers is the right call since the \*\*herd mentality\*\* of cheating and fraud us Indians have is extremely concerning and today it was exposed internationally (definitely not the first time).

Average dumbass opinion. It's not the problem-setters' responsibility to ensure that there is no cheating. The problems themselves were pretty good imo.

Over to the suspicions of leaked questions, none of them have any evidence. 

Stop blaming the authors before you have some experience in the field

Codenite 👏👏

The excessive cheating by using AI is not directly not the problem setters fault. The problem set was genuinely good just that the recent newer models were capable of solving most of the problems easily. The chances are very high a lot of upcoming contests will have the same result. It's not the problem setters but the many participants from kgp and other Indian institutes who ruined our reputation.(Inda already had a very bad image on cf but it just got way more worse)

WOW what a fking joke, even the top students are cheating, leave merit itself seems to be dead, all seem to be zombies using chatgpt.

Which exam today can truly claim to be free from cheating? From JEE Mains/Advance to end-semester, mid-semester, and job entrance exams — cheating is happening everywhere. It's time we start learning to live with it. This is the harsh reality, and no one can stop it. Long live GPT!

How is this the authors’ fault?

This is so embarassing man

If students from a top university of a country are doing this shit then god help us

Slowly recruiters will stop using leet code , cf and other coding sites as a viable metric to filter candidates

I hope these handful of dumbasses dont turn every competitive Platform into utter dog shit

Looks like competitive coding will be soon dead, thanks to AI

You do realise that there are youtube channels (not one, many) which actually reveal solutions to the questions, some even for free, directly screen recording and sharing the solution live during the contest. In fact one of these channels shared the solutions upto div 2E in yesterday's contest (the educational round), and solved all questions in a recent div 3, which would be enough for a person to reach at least expert, if not CM or M. Unless some actions are taken against these channels cheating will continue to reach new heights in each and every contest.

Bro not only IIT KGP , but its a start of a new wave of racism against Indians in global CP community

avg iit kgp event

This doesn't reflect badly on KGP, no one in the global scene knows anything about KGP. This solidifies a already tarnished image of INDIA as a land of SCAMMERS, CHEATERS and dishonest people.

I mean wth, it took me almost entire time to solve till D, only to realize that even after that I am ranked almost 1.9k, too much cheating in this round

Whole college? MORE LIKE ENTIRE INDIA!!!

Indian coders image is tarnished by YOUR college. (I know imma get downvoted but fk it, this third class behaviour is not expected by IITians who are top 1% of Indian engineers, I guess they are still having the Indian mentality at the end of the day.)

I just read a post on code forces where a user said they are Indians so it is SELF EXPLANATORY.

I guess the release of OpenAI o3 has also enabled a lot of these cheaters.

I know some peeps who never came close to top 500 from kgp going for top50 or 100 from kgp itself they just removed their name from iit kharagpur . So yeah I am suspicious of leaked ques.

Plot twist: The problem setters themselves used AI to write those problems.

True it was a big mess . Idk i feel it's bcoz of 1-2 ppl

Not only this internal contest, look at Div 2 , Div 3 contests nowadays, apart from usual GMs and LGMs , there's newbie accounts infecting the rankings , glory of CF is gone tbh.

What a loser attitude. How are the authors responsible for the contestants? Is he supposed to go to every cheater and tell him not to cheat? If the hate was targetted towards the cheater it would have been understandable but hating the authors just because they are indians is simply racially motivated. It was further amplified by the Chinese gm who has is known to be racist prick in the community.

bc isi chakkar k karan cp chhor diya second sem se hi! ek to codeforces ka bkchodi bhi nhi pta rhta jab chatgpt 1 question bhi solve nhi kr pata tha tabhi mera solution kisi se match kiya and -160 lga tha tb se chhor diya! aur ye cf pr jab bhi koi contest india se host hota hai bahot backlash milta hai bc pta nhi kyun

Lmao

the amount of joblessness u gotta have to learn everything about the event and not contribute to anything in it

you guys made a joke out of yourselves

i was embarrassed by the post itself. not to be rude but how can a specialist and an expert create problems for div. 1? i do not understand.

Also as for your allegations on leaking the solutions, the problem setters have worked hard for over an year on these problems, why would they ever consider leaking the solutions and ruining the contest 🥲

"I didn't cheated"

They should ban the authors. What the heck they thought that how they will get away with it. I mean solving each problem from a newbie account. Cheating also requires brain ig

Similar happened an yr ago lmao. These ppl never learn

Post bhi AI se hi likha hai ye

Brainrot influencers have destroyed the CP culture in this country.

What a loser

Is this how "IITians" tier 1 graduates type in English? "I didn't cheated using AI...". So pathetic, they don't know English well, nor do they learn how to respect the integrity and credibility of a rated global coding competition. Shame.

i mean not to promote cheating but bro could have said i was testing how god AI was or was going cluely way and wanted to prove cheating is possible

Bhai, iska cf profile dm karna zara 😂

bhai isme Codeclub ki glti kaise hui ?

pehli baat wo cheaters ki glti hai, aur wo har contest me hai, is wale contest me wo bahut jaada ho gye bas ye issue ho gya

Aur Codeclub ke jin logo n questions diye the usko GM,LGM,CM jase logo ne testing round me approve kre. Aese hi hawa me question nhi diye gye the

Ab kuch jaada hi cheating hui to kya kre? Ques banane walo ki glti todi kahoge

 
Ab kaho Chatgpt,Gemini,Groq,Claude companies to jase apne model ko improve hi nhi krti.

Log premium AI model se cheating krte hai. AI compnies bhi to apne model ko improve kr rhi. Hard ques solve ho gye is contest me, agle 1 saal me dekhna sare contest me na ho aesa

English bhi chat gpt se likha leta

Wtf this guy cant even speak english properly.And dont come at me with elitism and such bs , they are being taught this language bachpan se .

"Prompt Engineer" 🤡🤡

PLEASE DON'T ABBREVIATE CYBERPUNK

I agree to some extent. Current AI models are so advanced and evolving that it's difficult to ensure that no problem can be solved by it.

Further to add to OP, CF platform itself rechecks every question and have a lot of testers outside of problem setters. So you can't blame CodeClub for any mishap. These problems were accepted by CF standards and given green flags by people outside of CodeClub.

As to claims of organisers having "low" ratings, you should check the amount of time spent on CF, the GRAPH of their performance rather than just the "colour". I know some organisers personally and they are highly qualified and master-level coders.

C was simply about making the tree linear, the maximum value of m is n\*(n+1)/2 and minimum value is n itself. Also, if you take n = 5, you can notice, that 5 4 3 2 1 (as a linear tree) have the maximum value of 15. 
4 5 3 2 1 has value 14. 
4 3 5 2 1 has value 13. 
and similarly repeating the same, 4 3 2 1 5 has value 11. (15 - (5 -1)) 
Similar can be done for 4, and 3 2 1 4 5 will have a value of 7. (11 - (4 - 1) ) 
Using similar operations, you can reach the base sequence with minimum m value, 1 2 3 4 5 with value 5.

Then what is a valid explanaition for this level of cheating where the top 20 non red coders beat a red coder? That is just the start read the blogs see for yourself the depth of cheating that has happened, which has never happened before, check the recent rounds, what is a valid explanaition for all this then?

[deleted]

It’s in thousands now

Show is your git commit history, code forces, leetcode profile , should be mandatory every time some one applies for F1 visa

Ya I agree. Rather than using a hundred MCQ questions of physics and mathematics in JEE or any other competitive exam, a new pattern of exam should be endorsed in which a few problems (5 or 6) of utmost innovation have to be solved within a frame of time.
Make the problems extremely hard and innovative like an open book exam and let them have 6 hours to solve them.

The interviewers take test on pen and paper or board now a days.

D was doable honestly, i had a course discrete maths last sem i did that being 1400 lol

So wtf is the point of these contests, these people don't want to solve only got at the end of the day.

same. I was expecting a sub-500 rank w my solved (I didn't look at submissions per question until after I was done w D). Lo and behold, 2k. I've had sub 1k rank with 3 solved in previous contests.

Pretty disappointing contest, to say the least.

top 1% engineers lmfao, I highly doubt that statement.

Issue is that coding questions asked in the interviews are significantly easier, so even someone with low rating can crack the interview. Trouble comes when it comes to shortlisting resumes for interviews and since this is a number and can be quantifiable easily , companies will choose it blindly, also everyone has some projects but companies can have a metrics to choose people from and this causes the rush as jobs are limited and cheating is needed to pass.

To give their friends rank boost

Reservation 🙌

Duh dude, IIT doesn't care abt english proficiency

English professor nahi banana hai sabhi logo ko IIT me.

Chill bro I never said anything about your codeclub

It's just a random comment i found under the blog

And people were mainly angry because of the standings,if you compare the top 20, this contest had maximum number of non-red people than any of the recent ones (though they have been banned now ig)

" HANK !! DON'T ABBREVIATE CYBERPUNK!!!"

whats the lore in not abbreviating cyberpunk?

Are bro more easy concept just take out r from r*(r+1)=2*m if there exists an r and less than equal to n then just write r 1 1 2, 2 3....,r-2 r ,....,n-1n soeasy bro else give -1.

Should the Question setter should also provide laptop with monitoring tools to detect cheating? 
If thats not feasible the rounds should be conducted on pen and paper.

I think you are talking about this blog: 

I dont see any evidence here. In upd2 he links a comment, but that comment clearly mentions 30 min "before the contest ended".

That mindeveloped fucker is clearly anti-indian.

I mean Jee advanced and Olympiads are the closest form of the examination that you explained about, you can talk about ISI,CMI, KVPY,NISER etc examinations too which Focused on the same concept, they didn't get in to IIT solving random 100 mcqs who they memorized, they were the ones who were in the merit list in all kind of these examinations which includes solving very very unseen hard problems

1550. chromate is not a specialist, firstly, and he does not set rounds alone.

i am genuinely curious, do you think that you're capable of setting rounds for people that are your_rating + 1000? i definitely cannot. i do not even know the names of topics that are asked beyond a div. 1 B or C.

edit: sorry switched accounts mistakenly :p

mai codeclub me nhi hu bhai. 

same bhai mai wahi keh rha top 20 me AI cheaters the sare

ww is not a cp, right?

damn, this is even better, thanks for sharing this!

yeah my bad in the ss it was mention as 7:06pm i thought it was ist time I realized it now that he was Syria i am absolutely sorry i take my words back

This just signifies that the government doesn't want to overly glorify meritorious students who can think critically, rather they want people who would unquestioningly work very hard to get the carrot they offer.

Smart people are harder to use because they can think things through.

yeah. Also even the hardest problems in Div3 rarely venture beyond Seg Tree/hard DP. That's chromate's schtick, and he's good at it. Div3 is usually Math/Ad-Hoc/Standard Topical.

Ik AI is good. But this is the first contest in a long while that I've genuinely felt this out of depth wrt competition.

[deleted]

a paper published in theoretical CS has nothing to do with setting up a contest lol. i think it is obvious (to all of us) that no one should be setting up problems for people their_rating + 1000. it is just that i can accept this fact, and you cannot.

Title: Wow 😳

So fan is the issue !

Adding new ways to die, by heat stroke during summer, inside the rooms. Institute of eminence fr

i have many methods to die in my list

Nice job, next remove toxic professors as well.

AC lagado😅

But he can jump from the top floor na?

Removed ceiling fans? These fucking idiots need to be shoved into a room in one of the older Halls during summer and locked in there for a couple of days. Phir pata chalega inko.

Masterstroke!!! Now engineers will be forced to innovate even to commit suicide. 🫡 
Who knows, they might even come up with a ranking on whose methods were the best, and then parents can flex their kid's rank...

But mere room pe fan chal raha abhi bhi

Some of you actually need to read the article before commenting. 

The full article says that they understand the mental issues behind this will not go away with fans and they are working to better mental health. No, the fans are not being taken away. They are being replaced with spring fans that cannot support the weight of a human and hence cannot be used for suicide. 

Whether or not the mental health commitment are hollow promises is up to you to decide but at least do not spread fake information.

So AC in all rooms? 😋

Removing ceiling fans due to suicides is like banning vehicles due to accidents on roads. Even a 10 yo would say this is a dumb idea

The Kota situation is repeating all over again

They gonna do everything except the real solution 😭😭

Fake !!
No fans have been removed but yes campus mothers have been introduced

most competent college admin of all time

IISC me chal gaya, kyunki woh bangalore hai, temperature rarely 30 ke upar jaata hai, idhar saala 30 ke neeche chale jaye bahut badi baat hai, they don't know what the fuck they are doing, (January me jo hua tha woh toh pankhe me nahi kiya tha grill pe kiya tha)

Ohh yanii students ko fan dekh kr hi sui\*\*\* ke thoughts aate honge.

Fan dekha aur mann kiya , " Yaar kya fan hai , ispe latakne me to maza aaega !! "

Wooow !! New thing learned today...

I'm in for "Campus Mommy"

what does campus mothers mean?

Campus mommy 😂

NEW DELHI: Faced with a troubling spike in student suicides, IIT Kharagpur is taking an unusual but decisive step, downsizing ceiling fans in hostel rooms to make them unusable for self-harm. The initiative is part of a larger mental health push aimed at protecting students from moments of impulsive distress.

AC nahi aane wala. “Downsize”

Can anyone explain in detail ? It's really hot most of time in hostel rooms, now this???😭😭

Cutoff their dihh

Ac rooms will do

Even the iitan can't see the problem is not fan it's inside the mind 😔😔 o

Campus 'mothers' really, can they not hire professionals for this?
How do educated ppl from prominent institutions even come up with this 18th century ideas?

Suicide krne wale kahi bhi suicide kr skte hai

Fan Hatakr AC lagaya room mei?

Campus Mother raat me pankha bhi jhalegi kiya ?

Hataake lagaoge kaha? Pichawade mei?

Do we really need a fan for the rope to hang on ? Plenty of other things. Unless they are implying that IIT students are dumb enough they won't know anything works for that Fans are not necessary for the ropes to go.

Don't they know that jumping from a height can also cause death 😂 ?

They even make sure we don't die due to obesity by giving only one egg in the name of egg curry

Rakhi Sawant was a visionary, indeed. That's why even the premier institutes are inspired by her

learning from IISC bangalore, although kgp weather mein it's impossible to survive without fan

Aur banao sumchaks jaise chutiyon ko director. That guy is bogus !

Now people will die of heat

The Institute is dumb shit. The authority will never claim these suicides. Motherfuckers

Now table fan

Rakhi sawant was a visionary

They will do everything to prevent the problem except solving the problem !!

Rakhi Sawant said this in 2016 as a Suicide prevention step.She is a fucking Genius.

[

Any IIT KGP student here? 
I want to know the reasons. 
Academic Stress (Attendance/Grading/Course Weight) 
or Something else?

One suicide today in IIT Bombay

So it was the fan the whole time damn it

Bhai tum log ne aage ka nhi padha

Mental health pe focus krne ke alava sb krwa lo inse smh

If i don’t see a ceiling fan my suicidal thoughts will die :)

the most prestigious engineers are produced here, im pretty sure you all couldve come up with better suicide prevention methods

I am not an iitian so i had a doubt that why some people who get into IIT take their lifes . I mean those are the ones who do insane level of hardwork to go into these IITs and after achieving their goal they take their lifes .

As if it is going to solve the problem , are they gonna collapse buildings too to prevent students from jumping?

Remove the institute as well, guaranteed to bring on-campus suicides to zero

For an institution known to have the best minds of the country, this is quite stupid.

Garmi se marenge ab ek statistics se dusre statistic mai hi transfer kar reh hai ye log

"Oh I see you're bleeding profusely out of that laceration. Best I can do is a bandaid "

Housefull 5 ari hai?!?!

I mean till when we indians are going to focus on symptoms rather than the actual cause/disease.

What is campus mothers? It just sounds like a nosey aunty who would mock you for having emotions.

!gif

IIT(assuming people are educated and aware) ka page hai, kam se private dns hi use kar leta.. 😂 Ya housefull 5 ka promotion hai?

Campus mothers is kinda sexist, have a dedicated therapist, female professors might have already had hard life working to become a qualified professor, now they'd be forced to do something they didn't sign-up for as well instead of maybe some research

IISc did this 5 years ago. Honestly, KGP is behind. 
Hang in there, KGPians.

Nothing a single strip of dolo 650 can't help with 😊

There is a teacher there who literally bullies student, emotionally trolls them. Puts burden on them and keeps acting s*idal

What are campus mothers? Can someone explain?

Tf Is campus mothers..

Accha Hua KGP nahi gya (kahi nahi gya💔🥀)

They should remove windows rods (whatever it is called) too.

Didn’t Rakhi Sawant also say this? I remember there was a video where she urges govt(I think) to get rid of ceiling fans.

I taught IIT people were smart enough to figure out the core issue and reason. This kind of makes me feel I am smart and they lack EQ or they just refuse to see or that level of pressure makes them what the become later in life.

campus mother thing is fu**** sexisz

Campus issued mommy now, PM Milf Dilao Yojna tomorrow. This is the development I (I don't vote) voted for.

what in the patriarchal sh1t is this maaannn?

They don't need campus mothers, they just need more sex with same age, sex has been proven to increase good feel hormones, maybe then they will not feel sad, because at this age, suppressing hormones and pressure of studies makes them mad, I know india will not listen my words, but it's the only solution

But at least there will be no sucide

No this is not a good hot take , india is still not ready for this one , and this is not even a solution

Ayee ayee tea

Bruh. so painful. literally just jump from some 6-8th floor of a building head first. pain only for a few moments, if at all

Why not

Chalo Kam se kam ac to lage ge

Damn? Head first from 8th floor? That's a thiccccc skull

heat stroke se marne thodi na chodd denge

ig its better too, can keep it near bed while sleeping and at table while studying

Exactly.. crime and rape cases will increase this way .. it's already worst

Idk i mean, there is always a chance you live by sheer stroke of luck, i mean people have survived with a fricking bullet in their head.

Title: The dream of many but only few lived it..

The many dreamed of it without knowing the reality of it. Those who lived it, their dreams were nowhere close to reality.

Happy to see comments people are not assholes

"The dream of many but only few lived it.."

Can we stop it? IDK man, I think I have grown a little older, but now things of this sort don't even make me happy. Sure I am sort of proud of my university and what I did to get there, but it doesn't even matter now. 

Even if "only few lived it", it does not matter. These kinds of statements make it seem as if this is the end of all things. I am sorry, I don't mean to come across as rude, but stuff like "dream of many but only few lived it" has such bad intention to it almost. 

I remember there were juniors who when were asked their achievements, said "cracked this and that exam". I mean sure dude, so did we all, is that what your life is about? 

Enjoy your time here, but let it not consume you.

Few....

 17000 population of just iit kgp:

I hate how there’s nothing other than the campus. Had horrible experience here esp with profs

Trash institute

Most professors were trash. The only thing I gained is a group of really close friends. Reminds me of a certain dialogue," bahar se jo jungle jitna hara bhara lagta hai andar se utna hi khatarnak hota hai"

haa be hila lo building dekh ke

Well yes in terms of outer appearance and materialistic achievement maybe. But the mental trauma and suffering till date says otherwise.

Man I love these comments.. 

Fuck glorifying institutes..

The tagline should be "The dream of many but only few lived it.. majority wasted it"

Mera sc dost ko yahi pe seat mili. Chimkaandi sala baat bhi nahi karta ab

Yeah, actually it was a dream but we didn't even realise and it became a nightmare

ek cheez toh man gya sbko apan college chutiya hi lgta hai chae mit hi kyu na ho

Coming to iit very soon for masters in 2 years. Not kharagpur tho

One of the most corrupted IIT's of our country.

Yeah good but ever thought of the ego it builts in those who went there and the inferiority complex in those who failed to go there, its a hub of education not the goal of life.

Comments dekh k pta chalta h ki log kitna rote rehte h harr baat pe.

It's not that bad. Nothing is perfect. One should also put efforts in things rather than always complaining

arey bhai life me sab aisi hi hota hai... maa baap bhi aise hi honge.. biwi bhi aisi hogi... bacche bhi aise hi honge.. imperfection me perfection dekhna padta hai aur maza lena padta hai instead of complaining...

fr

Mess wale dada ko bhi jodd rahe ho kya

Exactly.... Caption should be "dream of many, nightmare for few"

Can't agree more

Bro its not worth it u scored like 99.8 or 7 + right aim for  ivys  iit masters barely give u any lift if ur good enough

“It’s not that bad”

…Proceeds to be served with food infested with insects and rotten for weeks sometimes, not to mention the living conditions in the hostels.

Kgp has taught me how not to live life. I have never been treated worse in my 25 years of existence than the 5 years of kgp. And I grew up in a poor household to begin with.

>put efforts in things rather than always complaining

Yahi cheez desh ko le dooba hai. Complain mat karo bas sehte raho.

Sab apne hi log hain

What do you think about joining it for Mtech?

But masters packages are good. What's the issue? 

I can't afford foreign education even after scholarship it is very expensive afaik. 

Masters from iit is basically free

Is it that bad

Damn, when did you joined kgp?

Man, you completely missed the point of going there. Feel sorry for you.

We’ve been gaslit into embracing mediocrity as satya vachan

MMM hall welcomes you (guaranteed worst mess food on campus)

It isn't

Yes, I can assure that

You're really not a practical person.

How are the hostels for mtech guys?

Mailing about something that happened a year ago...highly sus, seems like an act of personal grudge and op just wants some reason to take it out

Freshers be like but but saar 50% girls reservation hona chahiye

is this a noisy screenshot or a photo of the screen? there's a random cursor? 
How did OP get their hands on this email?

They ask jee marks or marksheet for clg placement?

Bhai this is real issue people are decreasing their jee ranks 
Is this even possible to verify for company I don't think so, otherwise why will they ask us can't they get that from CDC. The point is academic section is bound to not disclose ranks I guess. 
Anyway one other real issue is transfering the codeforces profile to girlfriends 😂😭.

CBI INVESTIGATION NEEDS TO BE DONE!!

Infact another close girl to him, got her internship sorted at Goldman Sachs through him even after fucking few rounds of interview previous year, and now having a PPO.

Aah shit here we go again moment

Why don’t you all get together and maaro usko. Parents aaye toh uno bhi thoko aise insaan bada karne ke liye. Bas maaro yaar

So the companies do not check that the ranks the students upload are correct or not....

Lol this bitch got sorted Day 1 in Urban Company...gaand mara mara kr

Hi Siddharth Jain 22ME3FP44, strange you chose to spend time tracking these two ppl instead of making your girlfriend Roquiya Qamar prep for placements

What is Vinutha Soni’s category?

[deleted]

Do company reject on the basis of 10 12 and adv ranks??i thought they only care about cg

Pehle yeh clear karo yeh bandi kiski hai?

Bhai everyone fakes their jee rank in company ke forms, not a big deal, i have seen many people do that. Its the responsibility of the company to cross verify if they are asking for the rank of an exam a candidate gave 3/4/5 years ago

dildo of consequences rarely appear lubed 

pleas make this true lmao

u/Big_Rub_69420 - do ittt

Krde bhai, ghamandi logo ko humble Krna zruri hai

Oh lmao, PLEASE give us an update

Placement

[deleted]

Give credible proof to the top comment pls

In dono ko hi track kara

Ngl but they can be influenced as well

Hi Roquiya Qamar 24ID60R05 placement lag gayi kya teri? Yeh sab fake stories banane se better hai ki apne career pr dhyaan delo. Ab saamne wale ki day 1 lagi hai toh kuch toh machaya hi hoga in my opinion, tum bhi acche se prep karlo, interview clear hojaayega

Seg ka liya

That's the very heart of kgp now, top reasons to avoid this college from new admissions pov

Most don't care. Only a few do

Officially no, unofficially yes.

In our iit SRIB and 1-2 other companies considered the jee rank and the rest 95% of the companies didn't

Yes, it will matter a lot in your career

then the company might decide not to come at all lmao

The threat was clearly of an obstruction in OP's placements. idk for sure, but ig OP must have got a PPO or something similar which makes the threat invalid now.

Last year a few asked ranks before the CBT exam. Not only ranks even class 12 percentage. I don't remember now which companies they were. Don't know the scenario this year. But most don't ask.

:), abhi tho pheli job lagane mai padai hai

Baki bhad mai dek te hai :)

Bro that's so scary mann

how am i to believe you otherwise

I aint seeing any mandate banning companies asking for JEE adv rank, though i can see they cant ask for category, which is not the case here, so yeah dumbass, read urself first before sharing

Yeah some/many companies ask for 10 12 bachelor grades though not JEE Rank. I guess they used that info to make some kind of resume score.

 Hardly one or two ask for JEE ranks (they want that hardcore lineage I guess, one HFT even asked for below 500 all India rank students ).

[deleted]

Which HFT?

bro they stopped asking

One thing, rank aur category me relation? 
Also,Cdc aane do, fir test ke beech me acche se protest karna ki tumhara rank pooch lia

Edit : there is a possiblity that u were not even shortlisted to give test of those companies, in that case i wont blame u, but still give us the relation bw rank and category

How high are the chances that their parents would request the diro and he won't expel them? Keep us updated lad.

imagine getting into kgp cse and then getting expelled

What happened? Did all the ones mentioned here assault the guy named Varun Ahari? 

If so, then assaulting a batchmate with the help of your juniors is deplorable.

Oof, getting expelled in the final year has gotta be a kick in the balls. I hope the investigation was fair and the deserved ones got the punishment.

Congratulations 💯😂

Well done

Can anyone give me context?

Wow all the hard work to get into a great institute thrown away for what?

Hi, my distant friend from iit kgp got beaten up pretty badly in in march april around idk, since then he was recovering but recently he sadly passed away, his name was sourashish chatterjee, we don't know the full story, if anyone here knows about it then please let me know what exactly happened, I mean a student died, 
He was in 4th or 5th year I think , mechanical branch

Is this legit ? What these people will do after semester expulsion

Bhai tum acche pdhne likhne waale bacchon m bhi gundagardi chalti h kya?????

Good decision.. but imagine student getting expelled from iitkgp for which you struggled a lot.. btw a very good decision 👏👏👏👏👏

Masla kya tha !?

Mamla tha kya ?

wow! action against 11 people..Situation has to be really bad for this kind of actions to be taken.

[removed]

Expelled?? In final year??

Someone explain what happened there

I don't know why do kids are so desperate to know what just happened. Chill guys, life is so uncertain. Try to know yourself. They are one of us. The best way to deal with all this is to know why these things happen? What's secret? Life is so complex. Analytical ability is not the only solution.

Where did you get this notice??

Bruh why did you even brought up his name here? You dont even know the context here

True

What happened tho

Had been a fight with sticks and bats

I’m not sure if it will actually work. I’ve seen a similar incident back in my second year, when a group of second-year students from Azad assaulted a student entering his hall. Unfortunately, Sudarma Bharti (mentioned above) was also involved. As far as I know, two people from that group were expelled - one of them was quite influential, had strong political backing, and used to drive a Scorpio around campus. He had even received a semester back/DC earlier for similar misconduct (though I’m not entirely sure about it)

Could happen, I've seen some other iits reduce such punishments to year back or something similar, I think it might also depend upon the victim but idk

The decisions are taken by the disciplinary committee, not by the director alone.

Reservation

It's a fight between different years, not 1 vs all.

Because actions like this set precedents. And since this wasn't covered up by the admins themselves, don't the students have a right to know what actually happened? Understood that logo ke personal lives me nahi padna chahiye pr jab aise mar dhar ho jaye that is no longer personal, that is serious.

Kal senate meeting hui thi
Usmei finalize hua hoga

Then why u want to even know?

Bro what if the person had died then tell me do u even know the severity of physical assault done .. no right so keep you mouth shut or just get assaulted one time then tell to leave those who did it to u ok.. just giving baseless opinion when u don't have even knowledge what happened there ok.

Borat

Arey I meant why is praneeth not in the list.

I dont know what your issue here. Once you are saying about illu and another time praneeth. They were drunk and most of the expelled or Suspended once were already caused issues multiple times like Ganja other fights. Agar tu Har baar ganja k saath ya ladayi karte Baita h so insti admin is not going to save even VP is not the right guy take the decision.

VP hai bc. Students vote karte hai taki wo defend kare students body ko admin se. I know he doesn't have full power but he have to authority to speak in these regards.
3 students expelled is a lot. Election mein khade kyu hote hai aese chutiye jub gaand mein guda nhi rehta

physical fight b/w some people

Bhai DM to thoda tea milega kya👽😈

Between whom? I have a good idea of what the reason is already, but would like to confirm - illu?

How did he get into IIT?

Disco ( Disciplinary Committee) jab machati hai to koi nahi bachta.
In Kanpur it was called DISCO.

bro still with reservation his rank will be good.

Wait the 2nd person is not a Jatt 100% can't say about thhe others tho

His name was sourasish l, I didn't know him that well,

4th

Tea kyu ni chahiye bhai? Diwali ki chuttiyo me enjoy krnedo

its more about what you should/shouldnt say rather than you meaning it or not. the n word isn't ours. the word has a harsh history w it. lets not add to our (indians') uncivilized stereotypical image by using that word.

You grow up and read a book!

Omg looks like I started a war

My bad i forgot 25tards also exist now

Even if he was involved, expelling the vp wouldn't be a good decision

True but no past records

Yes, he has the authority, but that doesn't mean he is obligated to shield students who commit serious offenses like assault. There is a boundary for everything, and we don't know the full details of the Disciplinary Committee (DC) meeting. I am not supporting the accused or justifying him. I just can't stand the blanket-blaming of Gymkhana members without knowing their side of the story—it's happened to me. You have the right to ask questions, but not to outright blame.

Please please

Nope, it was long back personal fights. Fight between friends because of some shitty ego issues.

Through advance.

PWD

Here it was called DC when I was there

😂😂

Do logo ki ladai me teesra pit gaya wala haal maybe

Do logo ki ladai me teesra pit gaya wala haal maybe

I found his quora. Surprisingly there's not a single news article about him. Tbh it's not even surprising.

Oh right. We are in 2025. Nvm

That's fair, but not when the Black people popularize the word in rap culture. You don't get to act surprised when other people uses this word. The world doesn't revolve around USA. If you don't want something to be spoken, maybe keep the word hidden away? 

Typical holier than thou attitude some of our Indian possess.

Username checks out haha

Nah vo koi VIP nahi hai, agar directly involved hota toh expel hojaata.

Good bro shi likhrha h😂

Ohhh

And girl

I heard illu was a trigger or something

FR

What's advance? Rishwat? 🤔

It's still called DC here

A guy dying is not surprising enough? What kind of dystopia goes on over there man?
Whats his quora tho

The word originated in that country and was used and is used to demean a certain set of people. And if you were to use the pejorative term Ghaati, I would have reacted the same way.

Black artists use that word to refer to one another as a way to reclaim the word. But if you were to use that word in front of an African American, it wouldn’t go down well.

Illu was never been a issue here. Stop this BS blaming Illu as always. Their fight was personal and they were drunk. This issue was long time more than 2 weeks before the DP itself.

What is illu?

Fake PWD certificate most probably

JEE advance

Indian colleges are a hell hole.

Quora - 

Idk if this is ur friend, but it states IIT kgp mech engg. 

It doesn't have much info tho, except a singular answer that he has posted.

I'm sorry tho.

That's the thing. Ghati or whatever it means isn't popularized by whoever it refers to. The African Americans are to be blamed for this. You cannot stop people around the globe who have learnt the word from some form of art. 

Besides, if they so wanna reclaim the word, they're being successful because other people use it without actually intention of putting 'em down. 

Popularizing this word and getting salty is the most American thing, tbh.

Achha ok

Illumination, an event at iit kgp

Title: We are the Oldest IIT with the largest campus of the...... Ohhh wait. LOL

Note: I'm unable to confirm, could be fake.

Build a new hostel so that students can accommodate: No
Stop admissions no student no accommodation: Yes.

My sibling studies here and I’m shocked at the pathetic state of her hostel… no space to accommodate students and their solution: squeeze in as many students as possible in a single room.

🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️ atleast they've accepted the issue finally

And yep, it's not fake :

Very shitty, qualified for JRF in june, thought about getting admitted.

Why will educational institutes be built if people want Mandir and Masjid?

[removed]

The management should work hard to say the least. Student strength increased manifold in past 4-5 years and they did barely any new construction... This was bound to happen.

demn, seriously iit kgp?

How YOU are the oldest IIT? 🤔

its good, we’re already over populated compared to other old iits; which makes our undergrad degree less worthy

Yess

I study in IIIT Bhopal. It's an institute of national importance, but we don't have our own campus. We don't have a hostel. Currently, classes are being held in MANIT campus. I don't know what's happening in our country. They can't even provide basic facilities to students.

It's weird how old IITs get such insane funding and still have such dire accommodation facilities. At BITS, the money the institution generates is probably a third of what top IITs get, but the accommodation is very livable.(can't call it good lol). Even most new IITs don't have these problems

Y'all are strange.

The country has more important things: like how to make things worse, how to reduce safety net, how to make speech illegal. 

Education is simply not a priority.

It's a similar situation here in IITD. First year (or sometimes first semester) MTech and PhD students don't get accommodation inside the campus. We have to live outside in PGs. They can't even build a hostel or increase the capacity of existing hostels. I don't understand where all their funding goes???

Looks like the incompetent authority

Average government college.

[removed]

I can confirm the accomodation issue

New hostels are already under process. Still, these problems are appearing every other day. Non sense.

[deleted]

[deleted]

Hein qualify krne ke baad nhi mila?

How educational instituties be built if people waste time on Reddit and Instagram, Go be productive.

Yep, dudes annoying af

Ai fucker

Who else is the oldest IIT?

Its pretty common to have a remote campus before all the IIIT infrastructure is built. Heck even MANIT students didnot have many new department building \~10-15years back and students were crammed into other department rooms and hostels.

IITs get funding for research. They can't use it for building construction. After the recent hike in student intake in 2020-21, IITs /NITs got the construction money at a much later stage. Also, most of the central funding are stopped. IITs/NITs are to generate their own revenue from the research and patent selling. 

Thus the all problems.

There is something called foresight and planning which Indian bureaucracy severely lacks.

Population control program.

Same is the case with IIT Kanpur. Close to 1000 fresher males in a hostel built to accommodate about half of that

If admissions do not take place, how will I join ? that is the point I wanted to make. I have the JRF award letter with me.

Aagya justification ka lawda , mera choco lulli chaat le

Didn't ask you whether you waste your time on Instagram.

🤡

That's theoretically possible!🧐

Roorkee

No, due to covid the new hostel's were delayed and now the new again the work is on pace but it'll take 1.5-2.5 years to recover from the lag of covid, and the new capacity is enough for next 10-15 years once the new hostels are built

Is it the oldest IIT or the oldest engineering college?

As far as I know it became an IIT only in 2001. I have met a lot of other Roorkeeites as well who call it the oldest IIT. Who is teaching them all this? Does the whole college believe this?

COVID was in 2020-21. Many projects started and completed since then .Itna time nai lagta Bhai.

IIT Kharagpur was the first IIT to be established in India by Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of India, in West Bengal. The first AIIMS was also supposed to be built in West Bengal only, as per Nehru's wishes but, following the refusal of Dr. Bidhan Chandra Ray (the then-Chief Minister of West Bengal), the first AIIMS was built in New Delhi.

i am not rejecting the problem, it exits but the work is in progress to solve the problem

For future use, "exists". Yeah I am sure candidates will understand.

Title: I am a Prof, and I am not okay [serious]

This is a post about mental health. And, a request to just patiently read.

I am a prof here at IIT KGP. I felt the need to post this because I have sometimes seen mental health being laughed at. Or being trivialized as just a modern-day excuse. I just want to share a few things here so that if students, who are suffering silently, see this, they will know they are not alone. It can happen to anybody, even profs.

A bit of background first (call it flex, or whatever you GenZ guys call it!): I have had a stellar academic record - starting from kindergarten all the way through Boards, then IIT, then PhD, and beyond. Even as a prof, I have been fairly successful. I am well-liked as a teacher ... actually if the teaching feedback is anything to go back, I am extremely well-liked. I actually love teaching. I joke around quite a bit, and the students are candid with me outside the classroom too. With my colleagues (both junior and senior), I am on extremely good terms. Various academic and non-academic things going on in the Department - you name it, I am in the thick of most of them. In short, *externally*, no one would suspect a thing.

But ... It is a bit of a mask.

Internally, something is not quite right. Some days, I can barely manage to pull myself out my bed. It is not physical. I just cannot bring myself to put on the mask once again to face the world. There is a deep, deep melancholy inside my chest. I try to forget it all by whipping out my smartphone, and scrolling through Twitter or Reddit. It momentarily lets me forget everything. But I have to come back. I have to. And, it takes all my will-power. But these are still not the worst days.

Some other days, I just don't feel anything. I cannot conjure up any love for anyone or anything. Hell, I don't feel alive enough to even hate anyone. Just a crippling numbness.

On the worst days, the melancholy is so overpowering ... I can almost feel a darkness enveloping my mind. No amount of scrolling through social media, listening to any music, or anything gives me respite, even momentarily. My thoughts keep going repeatedly to a feeling where I want for everything to end. Just want life to end.

The only thing that stops me is my responsibility to my wife and my kid. Also, the responsibilities towards my PhD students. And, my teaching (as I said, I love it!).

So, despite everything, I get up from bed. I put on that mask. I go to my Department. And, I carry on. What often brings me back is the utter busyness, the mad spikes of professional load. That mask becomes my reality.

Sometimes, I try to take on more professional load so I don't have to face my inner darkness. So that I am far too busy to be alone with my thoughts.

I will probably keep going on like this.

People may suggest that I should seek professional help. True. But those things are very easily said than actually done. It is much harder to actually own up in front of the whole world non-anonymously.

Again, I just hope that students who are going through a difficult path will read this rather long post, and realize that it can happen to anyone. Even to your own profs.

I am sorry, I kind of unloaded here without really offering any solution. Actually, today, is one of those worst days I mentioned above. And, I need to make it through it.

 
Edit: I am very grateful for so many helpful comments, and also the ones where people shared their own experiences.

Sir aap thoda ek do hafte ghum ke ayiye..... And watch "Tamasha(2015)" it deals with similar things you're going through. If you want psychological help there's nothing to be ashamed, but I don't think campus counsellors are good for you. Since you have the financial means just go for a good counsellor outside of the campus, maybe in Kolkata? That would also let you have a fun trip once in a while.

Sor first of all I don't belong in this subreddit but I'm an MBBS grad and what I've seen from my postings and working,

Sir it looks like you have clinical depression 

Please talk to your wife and friends 

Talk to a good psychiatrist and start meds if needed and take therapy 

Depression can defeat even the best of people. And there don't have to be necessarily a single causative factor. People can get depressed for unknown/variety of reasons. 

Please please talk to your wife. Please talk to your friends. If you feel you can't share with anybody else, please feel free to vent your feelings in my DM. 

I know it might feel overwhelming right now, but sir please believe me it gets better with meds and therapy. Please talk to your wife/anyone close immediately. Whatever you're feeling is absolutely valid and real. And don't ignore it. Hope you find the strength and support you need ❤️

I am really sorry that you are feeling this way, sir. Your situation resonates with me as I am also undergoing treatment for similar struggles. I can relate to your hesitation about owning up. For me, I've seen that depression can lie sometimes distorting our perception of reality. I was also apprehensive before opening up and seeking help from a medical professional, but I was surprised to see how supportive my family and everyone else turned out to be. I can tell that you have been an extremely supportive professor and I want to extend the same support from me. Please know that you don't have to carry this alone, you deserve help and care. Seeking help or owning up is not weakness at all but a sign of strength. I personally believe that showing that it is okay to seek help is one of the greatest examples one can set for their kids.

I am coming to IITKGP this year, sir. Everyone around me is treating me as if my whole life is sorted. That I would never have to worry again. My negative emotions are being dismissed as " Tujhe toh IIT milgaya, aab toh khush reh". 

The struggle for survival doesn't end even after getting into an IIT. Just because I got it doesn't make me less of a human to not feel the negative emotions. 

On top of that, first time leaving home. Leaving my friends and family. The journey looks pretty lonely to me. Hoping to find good friends there.

When I get something, I always put this expectation upon me to achieve something greater. And if I fail, I regret a lot.

Not a student from your college
Few advices i would like to give from my own experience. Please never try to play hide and seek and try to divert your mind. Try to resolve this asap. It may take months or years of time
Kindly watch cricketer robin Uthappa's video on depression and mental health. By distracting yourself you are just trying to avoid the reality. One day it will pile up and may feel unbearable. 
You are an asset to the society, you may think everything will be alright if you won't exist, but people who are left behind will suffer forever. We can talk if you would like to in dm. Always there to help who are suffering from mental health.
Hope everything will be fine soon🙏🙏

From your post, one thing is clear. You are a good person. Because you love your family, your students and your teaching. Melancholy can be deep rooted in multiple layers. You have to peel the layers one by one. Success in the outside world is not the same as success in the inside world. The inner world wants so much more than the outside world wants from you. Getting clarity is the foremost thing, and making yourself busier in work will only prevent you from getting that. Social media won't give you clarity. Spending time alone in the nature, meditating or talking to a therapist or even ChatGPT canm help you resolve your own emotions. Take care. We need more profs like you.

Is that you, JC? 😭
I don't think anyone else has got such impeccable English, nor such a record, I can't imagine

My other guess was AJB, but looking at your hinglish I'm pretty damn sure you're a fellow Bengali. God I feel so bad for you

Take some time off....go to some place...solo trips even ...from what i understand...u r in a cycle...u need to break it....the routine that's burdening u....and try to indulge in things without expecting some drastic change and relax
overcoming this is like water cutting through rock..if u get what i mean 
lastly u can try to seek professional help like therapy n all... nowadays it's very easy... everything can be done on ur smartphone 
all the best

ps...i totally feel u..been there...so just telling things that worked for me.
and i am proud of u that u r holding on to ur anchor and not giving up

ps again...just try to experience life more..and less reacting...i know it sounds boring..but this is really the crux ... hope this helps..wish u luck

Thank God I've such cool professors, i didn't want to be taught by heartlessly driven people who teach just for their bread and butter. I myself love the teacher-student relationship ALOT (it's lame yes but that's how I am). Im a fresher baccha of this year (faccha they call it) and I was very disappointed by the world in my 2 years jee because of the "faculty" that taught me, but not for me to learn and get me *educated* but rather for getting their salary and getting their increments by providing top ranks (meaning, they don't have any need with me and hundreds of others like me). But from my childhood, I've been loving all my teachers for them to show such love and affection and that made me love the government school ive studied untill class 10 more than the private school which gave me IIT Kharagpur and lots of fame for my dad in my family. My dad was my inspiration, he is a math teacher, and his old students STILL (being 25years old with family for themselves) are in contact with my dad, like my dad joined me in a coaching insti which was 450 kms away just because there's a student of his in that area, and he reassured to fulfil any sort of urgent needs. 

I'm truly grateful for having profs whos obligation to teach is to make students learn. I hope everything will get sorted out for you sir(as your **student**), even though I'm no one to speak about such mature issues being a kiddo.

Extremely relatable, even though I am a PhD scholar, and not a prof. Even I have a habit of immersing myself in work just to escape the empty feeling of my life. But that is definitely not a healthy approach, because those days when I have no work to do are extremely tough.

If you feel that going to the campus counselling centre will make your situation public, I can suggest a few counsellors based in Kolkata who have helped me a lot through my bad days. They are happy to take online and/or telephonic sessions, and your anonymity will remain preserved. But please do seek help. Living with this burden is extremely exhausting.

Hi professor. Your post encouraged me to comment on Reddit after a long time, so suffice it to say that I related a lot. I am not the same age as you, and definitely not as experienced. I have no words of advice for you. I am just writing this to share that I feel you. I have lived and am living what you're going through and understand your pain.

I graduated this year, and I'm going for my PhD. If things go alright, I might be in your shoes a few years later. During my time here, especially the last few years, I have felt a sense of emptiness akin to what you are feeling. I made great progress on my thesis, my supervisor was very fond of me, and I got good grades, but still, something felt wrong. I was unable to sit still for more than a few moments. I filled my free time with something or another - mostly research and work, but also friends, partners, studies, and if none of them worked, social media and shows. The emptiness leads you to this, which in turn leaves you feeling emptier. To help myself, I started working more hours. Off hours got filled with "busy productivity" - short tasks, email replies, and some LinkedIn messages - all so that I do not feel empty. Right now, while I sit at home awaiting the next phase of my life to start, it has become harder. I crave something to do.

I am writing to tell you that you are not alone. This knowledge has often helped me overcome bad days, and I hope it helps you too! :) Please, please take care of yourself. It may not seem like it, but the world does need more people like you. Sometimes, Kharagpur can be a tough place, and the best we can do is help each other as a community.

I can relate to this and regardless of age this issue is very relevant and affects us all, although I'm much less experienced than you, I'd still suggest that find the things in life that makes you happy (there must be something atleast) for me, i like reading, spending time with my friends doing bakchodi or just a good distracting talk to someone i value and cherish, yeah everything kinda sucks sometimes and it's hard to pretend to be okay but instead of blaming yourself or questioning why you're feeling this way, maybe start embracing all of your inner feelings cause pushing them around and ignoring does nothing, let yourself feel and let it pass as nothing is permanent, this melancholy is a part of life too, if you're too deep into it, pen down your feelings, maybe write something and (maybe you'll develop a new love for literature and writing in the process as i did lol) it's fine to take a break when things get exhausting and restart again when you gather the energy for it, find some joy in life, not just regular routine of getting up giving lectures dealing with students and coming back, take a break maybe go out with your family, do something out of your comfort zone, don't let the thrill go out of your life, there are so many things to do but we're stuck in this endless loop of doing one thing for the rest of our lives and it gets tiring and boring over time, i know we don't really have the healthiest coping mechanisms and different stuff might work for different people but hey atleast it works right?, find those mechanisms for yourself, happiness and joy isn't everlasting and you won't be feeling okay for each moment of your life, sadness, melancholy, tiredness, restlessly, hopelessness etc are also a part and I think if they didn't exist, we wouldn't know the value of those happy peaceful moments, you don't have to force yourself to be happy when you're not, it's just a sign that you're human and you've feelings but don't let that sadness or melancholy in your stay for long, kick that out of your system, embrace it, feel it but don't let it settle in you and there's no harm for asking for help, seeking professional or personal help is always useful rather than keeping it all inside, it might seem hard at first to do so but you'll be surprised how support actually helps you, and yeah i don't know why i yapped all of this but I can feel and I'm pretty sure many people can feel what you've been feeling so it's kinda a common thing and this might sound super cliche lol and it's really ironic when I'm saying all of this cause I'm very aware that saying shit is so much easier but when it comes to actually following it, i fail myself, i don't know if this post is legit, but anyway, i hope whatever 2 bits of my mind i shared would be helpful to someone atleast.

Should I say I feel you? 

This all is so relatable to anyone who has to assume roles for professional sake but feels so solitary inside. 

I read somewhere that teaching is a performing arts and your experiences reinforces the idea that so many of us here are trying to perform to the best of our capabilities. More powers to you and the likes!

It’s so resonating that you find teaching, like many of us find one or the other things, that keeps you going on your bad days. Keep finding more and more of such reasons. Maybe academics, personal life, family, something that brings smile to you when you’re alone. 

Welcome to the club, mate! Let’s keep performing for the sake of our love(s), and seeking lights within at the same time!

Hello sir. I hope you're doing better 

I'll ditch the formalities sir. 

I have been there. Meditation helped me. A simple disciplined Meditation even as much of 10 minutes works wonders. 
Even tho it does not sound fancy, it works, if you know how to. There are tons of gurus online trying to teach it but it does not work.

If you'd like, i can tell you in detail about it in dm. Whatever suits you sir.

If even what i offer doesn't suit the right fit, kindly take another approach.

Kudos to you🙌🙌🙌🫶
Very few professionals at this stage of their life even care to recognise this as a problem and you being so vocal about it, Inspires many. 
The draft, the flow and the honorary teacher perspective. I really appreciate you talking about this and there are no doubts for now that you are an Awesome person too.🤩

Student to Prof - Ye dukh kahe khatam nahi hota hai... The sadness gives you a meaning too. Celebrating that sadness with the things you love; What better life could somone dream of😊 
More Power to you Sirji.🫡

Sir, I am sorry you are feeling thus. And first of all, I would really like to appreciate you for pouring out your thoughts and sharing it on this platform, honestly I (I do not know about everyone else, but at least for me it is true) keep meeting people in my day to day life who make me feel as if life is a bed of roses without thorns and maybe I am the only person who is not enjoying or not able to look at the bright side of it, or maybe I am not as blessed or talented or capable as others, or maybe I am the only person who has a lot of negativity in my surroundings and has to cross a lot of obstacles and most importantly people try to hide the truth and show that they are genuinely happy and doing extremely well, and I could totally relate to your post, it felt like I am reading something very real after a long time. And yes, even I feel that discomfort to share all my troubles with anyone non anonymously, at times, even a brief conversation with ChatGPT, even though it is an AI model, or noting down my thoughts in a notebook and why they occurred to me, lightens up my mood. I often end up showing in front of others that I am happy (put on a "mask" just as you said) but deep down within I know my side of the story. There have also been times when I used to engage myself in more academic work simply to take my mind off the sadness. Sir, I would like you to know that whatever you are feeling is not abnormal at all. I am in no way qualified to advice you on this, but I have often seen that listening to music, or learning a new skill gives me a lot of joy. I personally have often been through hard and challenging times, and thinking about them gives me bittersweet emotions, sad because I had to face those at one point in life, and happy because I am over those for now. One thing I try to maintain always is being kind and helpful to others, there is a strange kind of happiness that I get from trying to help and be good to others. I believe that life is already hard, why make it harder for someone else, and just the feeling that I have made a positive impact on someone makes me feel inexplicably good, even if it is a very minute thing, coz little grains of sand and little drops of water make the vast deserts and mighty oceans. I really wish you feel better and it is a good thing you shared your feelings on this platform and I pray that you make through it, with sheer optimism you can conquer it.

Hi Sir,

Today is one of the day same for me as you may be I am not a good writer but it's hard to fight with inner darkness. Putting mask and get to do your responsibilities is the same thing and what I want to achieve in professional life. To be very Frank I was I was not such good in academics but worked it out being an average student. I took every hard decision in my life to be successful. Today I am being in that cream position where my academic phd prof call me or take a time to consult with me. Someday I also feel to just end the life but responsibilities... 😢 
Spending time in countless scroll or playing games or driving won't make it. Things which I used to like now I hardly I do or feel to do. May be I am not that expert to frame those golden worlds and risk it myself before whole world.

Pls pls pls share with your family and take treatment… request 🙏

Its a random suggestion, I Don't think I'm the right person to give you advice on this,

Advice:- You kind of have to follow detachment from your life, and rediscover yourself.

Here's a yt video i recommend watching 

Have a great day sir

Well had a feeling when I saw you joining or trying to join iskcon outside campus circa 2014-18 (my batch time). Also you were most loved then too. Too much enthu, burnout was natural outcome.

Believe me MS, you need not search the answers outside !! It's within and very less to be said about the scam that's running outside in iskcon.

Would love to interact with you. This time may be as a friend.

(You although never taught me directly but you were way too famous for me to not sit in your class secretly. So I did sit in your class stealthily)

Sir, if you don't want to go to the councelling centre here, take help from some other center, maybe somewhere in kolkata, or online. Though I believe it's better to seek help offline

I have ADHD .....the only thing I have learned from being told that I am extremely talented and have wasted it and losing multiple jobs is that I need to stop and look. I need to have a sense of purpose which comes from self and not responsibility eg: I love gardening.....that is my purpose detached from all other responsibilities.....this might help sir.... Also, I follow the Advaita Vedanta subreddit which talks about mind and how to come in terms with it..reading content from here might help you as well.

I am a Masters student abroad and did my bachelor from kgp. I love how the professors are so chill here. I did have some wonderful prof in kgp too but I think our whole culture towards education makes a "god" out of teachers. It's like the burden mothers carry of needing to be god like. Here ppl address profs by 1st name which was very weird for me but they hangout with students after class go for coffee etc. Usually if I meet my school teachers or profs outside in India they act very formal but all of a sudden when I came here they seem very human to me. Idk it's just something I noticed. 
 Also I am a female so I think more reason for male profs to be formal which I appreciate because we all know there is no lack of creepy profs in kgp or school teachers for that matter. But here I feel ppl are much more relaxed. I recently just asked a doubt to one of my proffs here and after class he had a long conversation with me and we ended up concluding it's a good research area as we couldn't find a good solution to it. I feel like kgp needs more organic connection between students and profs. I think that it is also one of the reasons for better academic productivity in the west even though ppl doing the hard work here are also Indians and mostly IIT grads.

Prof of which subject?

Sports will boost you sir. also, keep doing new things. #Love

I thought only students have mental health issues until I read about the suicide of an ISB professor.

Namaskaram,

For some reason this really touched me. Normally i dont reply to these posts.

Let me share a story which may inspire you.

For 4 years a schoolfriend of mine who worked as a doctor was clinically depressed. She suffered silently, i got to know the depth of her emotional issues only when she overcame her depression. Similar to you she felt emptiness within her, her emotions dry and that she doesnt even know anymore who she is below the mask she is wearing to fit into society.

After suicidal thoughts she got desperate and a friend convinced her to do a program called inner engineering by the isha foundation and sadhguru. In this program one will learn the shambhavi mahamudra kriya.

She told me, these 32 hours she spent there, were very transformative and for the first time since becoming an adult she cried. She said shambhavi cured her of her depression.

I also did this program. Acutally i am a bit afraid to write things like "I began to love walking in the forest near my house" or "Since Inner Engineering i have not once shouted at my parents in anger like i used to do before". But it is true.

You dont need to believe me. As a fellow academic i hope you take the time to examine this peer-reviewed study about the impact of shambavi on stress and generell wellbeing.

#:~:text=Shambhavi%20Mahamudra%20begins%20with%20pranayama,mantra%20(root%20syllable)%20Om%20chanted

I dont know you. I dont know your situation. So i wont say Inner Enginnering is a solution for you. But it was a solution for her depression and so many negative emotions that i had pent up inside me.

Sincerely, i hope you have the courage to invest these 30 hours of your life and see if it can also be a solution for you.

Take a break.

Taste failure.

Do something that you can surely fail at and feel like a human.

Failure will make you feel human once again.

Sir More power to you
I hope everything gets ok

I'm trying to maintain a small pocket dairy and note down all negative stuff whenever it comes to my mind , atleast you'd be conscious and wouldn't think further. Consistency is an issue but I think there would be results if executed properly. You should definitely give it a try

I feel that human minds are always in a state of 'ICU or ventilator ' . A single thought of 30 secs can destroy your whole week and months.
As the owner of house of your own mind ,your responsibility is to make sure the bulgars of negativity can't steal your mental sanity . 

Lastly, one of the most important advice is to start taking vitamin D everyday.

Thank you sharing this and speaking out. It's definitely imp to balance everything. I highly recommend meditation or pranayama based on your preferences

I wish professors of other colleges (NIT btw) too interact in such a way

might u are wrong for this

OP, you are a scientist. If someone says they will overcome diabetes with will power, you would think that's not possible. Diabetes happens because the body isn't having a balance of certain chemicals ( insulin in this case). Depression is similar - often there is something wrong with the level of neurotransmitters. Please see a doctor first, just to make sure that there is no underlying physiological issue. No doctor will prescribe medicine when it's not needed - especially since you are a scientist. Then, with doctors approval, seek therapy. You will thank yourself later.

Have you read Modern Man in Search of a Soul
Especially the essay “The Stages of Life”. In it, Carl Jung speaks of the emptiness that arises when life’s outer achievements are not balanced by inner meaning. This may resonate with you. 

Wish you all the best and seek help.

Hello Prof,

Thanks alot for sharing. This exactly I am going through. Lost interest in life.I am a senior banker and day in and day out deal with money ( not flexing just sharing) . Nothing seems to excites me. As about therapy it appears very superficial. All on the surface.I wonder what is this depressing feeling. Worked really hard to be here ( all stellar academics throughout ) but now it seems all waste. Wearing mask everyday to pretend that happy chirpy smiling face but vacuum of loneliness sucking inside. Seems lost connect with human race.No amount of shopping and vacations are allaying this dead feeling.Wondering is this a phase which shall pass too or a permanent feeling which is gonna stay forever with me. Any idea how to solve this problem 🤔?

[

IDK how much it would help u(or help you at all),but whenever i feel low, i use to watch lowkey youtubers who have low sub count and less views. 
I'm tagging few such channel,It's more of a soothing travel kind of content but i hope it helps you

I'm in kharagpur in case if you want a small chat then we can connect

Sir I don't know how relevant I might sound to you. I am sure that the stress and problems that I faced during my degree at IITKGP are nothing in comparison what you are facing life. But what I used to do when it felt that the stress / fear of failure is getting is out of hand , is I would book an ola cab and go home directly. Eat good food cooked by mom, get spoiled by my Dad, and get loved by grandma. And come back after a week. 

I would be again fresh when I returned to college. I don't know if it would be possible for you to do this considering the hectic schedule of profs at IITKGP. I have even seen some profs, ( even my MTP supervisor) come to office on Saturdays and Sundays, even going home late on weekdays (around 9pm). First, I used to think he is a very noble person to do so. Later when I asked him, i came to know his stress, the amount of work he has to do. I was shocked.

Anyways sir, if possible can't you make a random doctor's appointment for which you might have to go to the south for checkup, or some excuse and take yourself and your family to some cool, calm place to get a reset on yourself. Get started with a fresh slate that is.

Just my 2 cents.

Sir, firstly I would like to commend you for coming out so candidly. 99% of the people facing similar situations do not open up publicly. I am one of them. But we need to keep on keeping on. Might sound wierd now, but you can change the situation... I will say completely but not for the sake of being believable, will say almost. 
Go for a mentorship program... Yes, it will cost money but that is nothing compared to the transformation because they will force you to do things and before you know, you will start to see changes. And with that will come opportunities to increase your income, etc etc. I can vouch for this as I am a beneficiary. I wouldn't say I have completely past that depression but am way better. In a nutshell, focus on yourself... Think of how your kid will look up to you. Buddy, nobody cares for your sad story... The world is waiting for victories... So, it make it that. If you wish to speak to me, feel free... Email arinkb@gmail.com or call +91 7504538420.

Boss, take a vacation with family. Secondly, start avoiding the mask wherever you can until deemed to be important-life. Emotional numbness requires adrenaline!

Hey Prof. Thanks for speaking out about it. Very brave and much needed

This hits way too close. Feels like you put my mental state into words. The highs barely feel good, the lows are pitch black, and the in-between is just... sad. For the outside, my life looks like a lottery but I spend most of the day hating myself.

What you feel is nihilism. It happens after midlife crisis, where you are almost done with your personal duties (raising kids, paying off loans etc.) and couldn't find a purpose in life (me too). Don't worry, we are all temporary here. Only taxes & death is permanent.

Get help for depression appollo

Sir aap koi mandir kyu nhi jate, thoda spirituality really helps a lot, 
There is a problem with IITKGP, yha koi temple nhi h jha ja k aap bath sko or pray kr sko

Sir watch animations and divert your mind

Hello Prof, your story pained me. I'm glad I'll be leaving this place next year. I had little to no problem finding real connections and purpose outside campus but struggled my entire college years to find a few. I like what I do and some people make it worth keep trying.

My goto therapy are my pets. I talk to my cat everyday on phone in college. This may not be available to everyone. So I suggest considering evening walks in JG Stadium with your family. I see many families and tiny lively kids there. I had one random conversation with a 10yo which I recall and chuckle. I recommend Rabindrasangeet to calm your mind during the day. I'm not native bengali but I adore those songs. Also watch some old scifi movies. They're brilliant and will make you reconsider your way of living and thinking. Devotion is also never a bad idea. I've been to iskcon many times in past few months. Never felt more at peace.

These are my personal ways of coping. Wish you strength and purpose.

Play chess with me.

Listen osho

Hey , just leave the job start something new , a startup or something , you need a new perspective and you cannot get it by reading books you need to get out of your bubble of department and students , go to some other place see what's there. you may start youtube channel guide peeps like up anything random. try to do something which will give you asymetric returns , life is a lot. you get what you wanna attraact.

Dont take yourself seriously, take other people serious who are in need. Do what you can do for them. Read schopenheur and victor frankl

Mere se counselling lelo lol

>I am not okay

My Chemical Romance reference?

Dipankar debnath sir....apne real Id se aayiye na

Arre bhai, semester shuru ho gaya hai - ab ghumne jaaoonga to class kaun lega? :)

Yup, I am NOT going to campus counsellors ... even if they are good, I don't want to risk being known. 

I have seen Tamasha. It is certainly a good movie. But in the stage of life I am in now, I think it will be more of a trigger than a help. I'd rather watch some cartoons with my kid!

Hi Doc, I think the counsellors are more depressed than the patients. Everytime asking to think positive ,if it has been so easy i would have not approached the counsellor ( wasting both money + time) for the sessions. In India hardly you get practical advice. For theory we have n number of books.And I firmly believe that if you have not gone through this,you really cannot understand how it feels. Talking thing does not help cause it makes you more vulnerable and identified. Any other suggestions for quick remedies ?

First things first: Welcome to KGP. And, I am sorry I made you see this kind of a post even before you are starting here. God knows what you will think of IIT profs now! Hopefully, you will feel that we are all too human. 

I absolutely agree with what you said. Making a few good friends is your number one priority outside of academics. You have no idea what positive effect one good friend can have on your entire life. I was blessed to get such a friend when I was a UG student. 

I wish you all the very best in your journey here.

I actually talk to chatgpt, these AI agents really help you a lot when you are feeling down and drained. Great to see others do that too.

Thank you. For anyone else reading these, it might be just words. For me, it actually means a lot. 

Someone else also suggested "talking" to an LLM too. Might actually try it out!

Oh my godd, I was thinking of JC Sir too.

JC physics?

I think it is Prof. Puneet Kumar Patra or Prof. Saud Afzal. These are my guesses from civil.

Welcome to IIT KGP! Thanks for sharing your background. Please don't lose this sensibility as you grow older. Even though you are so very young, little words of help and positivity from you can mean a lot.

Thank you. I didn't know there were such anonymous online/telephone facilities available too. Kindly share in DM.

Thank you for sharing. And, also for the positivity. I wish you the very best for your PhD journey.

Thanks for pouring it all out. I assure that is absolutely a legitimate post. If I were to divulge who I am, most of my Department students would fall out of their chairs. 

I am guessing you are a current student. I commend you on the very mature tips you gave. Especially about acknowledging the sadness full on. 

I do read quite a bit, and yes theoretically I am aware of all the things you mentioned. But you are right. Knowing something theoretically and being actually able to do it are completely different things. I do try to get out of my head. 

I will admit, writing this post was a bit cathartic. 

Regarding the routine of giving lectures ... actually in my particular case, that is something I truly love. In fact, on some days it is all that keeps me going.

Also I'd suggest to check out this song by Avicii - "The nights", It's a song about the advices his father gave him as a kid, about life, now the singer himself is no more and it's ironic how he possibly died from self harming and he also had substance abuse disorder but the message he shared is pretty solid although he didn't follow it himself. [The nights](

Thank you. Are you a prof too? Or an alum?

Thank you. You can dm me.

Please dm me too.

Thank you. Likh ke thora man zaroor halka huwa tha.

Thank you for the very positive thoughts. What you said about helping others is the kind of feeling I get through my teaching (even if students bunk classes!). Perhaps for someone, somewhere, I am making some positive difference. 

I think another person mentioned about "talking" to an LLM. It is, after all, the collective "wisdom" from many sources. Might actually give it a try. And, all the best for fourth year.

The following is from the wikipedia article "Sad Clown Paradox":

Alan Moore's 1987 graphic novel [*Watchmen*]( includes the character of [Rorschach]( telling the story and naming the clown as Pagliacci

*Heard joke once: Man goes to doctor. Says he's depressed. Says life seems harsh and cruel. Says he feels all alone in a threatening world where what lies ahead is vague and uncertain. Doctor says, 'Treatment is simple. Great clown Pagliacci is in town tonight. Go and see him. That should pick you up.' Man bursts into tears. Says, 'But doctor…I am Pagliacci.' Good joke. Everybody laugh. Roll on snare drum. Curtains.*

Class matlo sir, students bunk marte hai ek hafta aap bunk mardo, yafir TA ko vej do..... Aur bacche ke sath cartoon dekhte ho to I would suggest pokemon yafir ben 10 start Karo, aapko vi maja ayga, ajkal ke cartoon se accha hai

Sir I'm really sorry to say you this but I think I have to for the betterment of the campus community.
I will ditch the formalities and head straight to the point.
1)most profs I have Interacted with are really sadistic,school teachers are infinitely better they try their level best to help out,but most profs?they intentionally try to make life hell.
2)Iit kgp has a really wicked and regressive policies,one of such that is only 1st and 4th gears are allowed for summer quarter and supplementary. Think for yourself,isn't this harmful for 2nd and 3rd years they aren't allowed to clear the backlogs.
3)my personal experience-my faculty advisor really hates to help out students and gives half truths or misguides them but when called out twists the direction of conversation.He misguided me so much that I couldn't clear the backlogs even from my 1st year till now,during that time he didn't even say me how to apply for supplementary.
4)profs laugh and insult us for not able to cope up with the academic pressure instead of recognizing the fact that the courses are hard and too many.
There are many instances.
I think you need to call out other profs for their wrongdoings.

I have never seen anyone more unethical and unprofessional than the campus counselor who counselled me. Me still being her patient/client/subject whatever, she submits a joint project proposal with my supervisor! Do they even have a bit of professionalism?

Watch modern family or schits creek

Sir I can Totally understand your feelings and what you are going through in life. Actually I have also gone through the same. I was the friend who is perfect in everything and famous in my acquaintance. But it all was a musk. This was not even the real me. Recently I was going through a lot of trauma and suffering and I was overthinking a lot then anxiety and panic attacks and all. I really feel like ending my life even. But then I tried to open up to my friend and I just said about all .... Like all the stuffs and everything...that it all was just musk ..... But instead of judging.....my friend really give me hope ......he understand me and said that.... I am perfect in my own way....for the world I can put on the musk but for the real core people I dropped the musk and It feels so much peaceful to me.....Now i find that people not only like me because of my musk .....they even like me for my real self ..... This gives me so much relief that I can't even mention...... 

Actually I have ASD (Autistic Spectrum Disorder) and I was just to feel human with the perfect musk..... But sometimes dropping your musk to your loved ones can gives you real peace in your life ..... So my advice is just be real..... And that's all.... 

For your condition I don't know.... But it seems similar so you can maybe check whether you have any ASD or any kind of similar things that would make life a lot better. 

I know my comments become very long and I don't know you even see it or not .....but if you see it I have only one advice for u ......just be real to your loved ones .... That's all.

Please feel free to DM me.

Sir, I might not be as experienced in life like you but I also face similar problems. I am also thinking about counselling and therapy but all these racing thoughts might have started due to hyper stimulation of the brain.Please take a leave or try to do Kapal bhati (faster than usual pace) and concentrate on just feeling comfortable with yourself, your surroundings, your body , just breathe in , relax and be comfortable with everything. Treat your thoughts like they are just there and nothing else, they dont matter, even if your thoughts are important or interesting. And try this breathing technique , first take a long inhalation, then release it slowly and start doing kapal bhati continuously at a fast pace (don't worry about how long it will take), then when you feel tired, again take a deep breath and re continue the process like a cycle. Don't think about how long it will take. While you are doing kapal bhati , concentrate on your head, after you take the long breath, you will feel like your head and scalp are burning , it is a good sign.
And never stop doing it. Do it for a few hours every day.Trust me sir, everything will change.
May you be blessed !

Heyyy, 
I'm sorry that you had bad experiences with therapists. It's true that many therapists might come across as insensitive and giving very generic advice. But if you have clinical depression, the best treatment you can get is meds + therapy. 

And once you are better slowly reducing the meds and then the therapy too. But yes choosing a good therapist can be tough and the only way is trial and error. Therapy and related techniques like CBT have been proven to help people with depression and other internal conflicts. And also there's this some weird relief that you get when you finally offload all your worries and you feel heard. 

For quick remedies, you can try add workout (will increase endorphins) to your routine and some walking, getting sunlight, having a pet/playing with a pet, going out with people you love, trying to engage yourself in things that'll give you a sense of satisfaction. Having a belonging feeling, being valued, having connections will all help because loneliness is one of the biggest risk factor for depression. Simply talking to someone itself can feel great.

But all of this is possible only if you have some minimum baseline energy and motivation. A depressed person is someone whose intrinsic reward system and pleasure system is wrecked and is completely out of energy.So if you feel overwhelmed, having suicidal ideations please don't refrain from seeing a good psychiatrist and start meds because meds are gonna create that platform with the neurotransmitters inside your brain and will enable you to get out of the phase gradually. 

Don't worry you'll get through this and few years later you'll be thanking yourself that you didn't give up and put in the effort now. Best wishes. Take care❤️

No sir, please don't be sorry. Being a professor at an IIT is a highly respected job and it is definitely not an easy job 🙏 No matter what we achieve or where we go, we are still humans and we do feel things. 

I don't know if it is possible, but if it is, please take a leave for a few days and travel to some beautiful and peaceful places with your lovely family. Maybe something new and off-routine could help ease it a bit.

Arey dont beat yourself up. Mental stress and depression sabko ho sakta hai. Be among the good ones for your students to always depend on you. And in turn nurture them as peers and friends so they become pillars. Its not easy. But trust me I was in your shoes. Exact same shoes including the kind of institution. Go hatke and spin the narrative to positivity slowly. cheers

Sure, Sir. I have sent you the contact in DM.

The state of mind u just stated is most likely a case of clinical depression as well as other disorders , often overlapping .Such things need treatment with medicine and counselling .U stated that your happy state seems to be masking your actual self .Such are quite serious issues .Plz consult a doctor . 
From my experience I can tell you that modern medicine can treat your issues mostly overtime and counselling will have a long term impact .
I visited Iiit kgp sub to check why so many students are committing suicide even one today .So sad to lose bright young lives with so much possibilities. 
If you need help you can message me separately .Will help .
Hope you will get better .

I’m in the same boat as you. 🙌

Why don't you start an anonymous blog just for Kgp junta? You are good at expressing yourself. May be write about your weekly learning/thoughts/observations or monthly whatever suits you. 
Writing has been proven to help many people. Apart from the excellent counsellors, writing could be your quantum of solace.

Wow that was eye opener

Shinchan is better tbh 🙂

Kya bol raha hai bhai 

Sir aap kahin jao ghum ke aao may be in india or foreign yrip

Your depression is their group project it seems.

Thanks for elaborate suggestions. It helps. I think in this world when we have too many options and where money can buy literary anything what we truly need is more simple less complicated conversations and genuine feelings for each other. Anyways thanks for your thoughts.Will definitely give it a shot!

wait till you come here,wait till you have to deal with profs for any administrative work,you will literally want them suffer all their life.Here profs are the real demons

That's actually not a bad idea at all. But I will have to think about it. Perhaps I can even share something periodically here itself on Reddit.

Haa but continuity maintain nahi hoti na, I always liked progressing stories(Ash being 10 forever is a different issue though)

Mene vi to wahi bola bhai

Yesss sure.. Do feel free to reach out if you feel too overwhelmed.. I'll be more than happy to listen.. 👂🫂❤️

Thanks much Doc. Will DM you for advise.

Sir hi to bole ki baccho ke sath cartoon dekhege, to Mai suggest kar diya

Title: I am tired of being single

Guys, and girls
I am officially giving up on trying to get girls , though I never made a move .
Ig this is it , my saint / hermit arc starts.
I won't let myself get distracted by girls . Ig I am narcissist, writing this post here, but what else can a loser can do other than complaining. Though not getting girl isnt loser but alright. 
I am going towards a path of no return.
Good bye Beauties , hope you never hit on me , which you never did.
😓🥲😒😏

As one of my friends said: get out of kgp and you'll get girls. College dating is not the end of your dating life

Weren’t you the same “genuine” guy who wanted to make girls feel safe

We never make a move thinking we are not enough what it requires. We judge our own potential before anyone else and then wonder how that guy got the chick without us even trying to get one. 
You have to be extremely lucky to get a girl here without trying. 
Besides it's better to go to gym and to keep improving yourself from all directions. It doesnt ensure you will get what you want but you will get what you deserve. 

By the way I am single too 😂.

It's better this way.

And why the fk should always guys should approach it's 2025

tell me how to make a move? tell me about the start.

Bro don't worry you are not alone

Everyone should have female companions, they give a new perspective over life but wouldn't you want to have more of a thought over who you actually want close to you

padhle endsem aa rha h

Us
Akhand Single

Real

true😭🥀

Awww... Don't just give up... Ik it might sound cliche but the right person will always find you at the right time! Now if you had told me few some time before even I would be like ughhh stopp there's nothing like that it's just said to give false hope blah blah blah!! But now that I have experienced it myself just trust me life works out in a very weird fashion.. one day you cry for someone the other you find out why you had to go through all that... I won't say that you'll find someone and it's gonna be all perfect but the thing is you are not even half way in your book to just give up like that the rest is still unwritten just don't give all that thinking so much time focus on yourself and just go with the flow!!! I am sure you'll end up at the right place op!!!

Trust me, boy, it is not even a real issue. play big. Although I have never had any girlfriend, and it does not even bother me now, it actually makes you free of unwanted drama.

As someone once said - 
 
हम को मालूम है जन्नत की हक़ीक़त लेकिन

दिल के ख़ुश रखने को 'ग़ालिब' ये ख़याल अच्छा है

Single life is better bro

In our days the gender ratio was around 1:10 . Any better now?

BTW.. no point attaching your self worth to whether or not you have a GF/BF.

Few examples from our batch
- One couple from our classmates got married
- One had such a bad breakup after kgp, ended up with trust issues. Still single.
- Most of of us? - never had a relationship in Kgp, now happily married.. either love or arranged

Your life in Kgp has very little correlation to what your life will be once you're outside.

Focus on the intersection -  things that make you happy + are in your control

Don't waste your time chasing butterflies. Mend your garden, and the butterflies will come.

bro try to make some good friends not gf

Tried but then felt like a creep so backed away silently 😞

incel final boss fr

Bhai jarurat kya hai, i am 22M , doesn’t even have anyone, 2 times rejected, maine sochke dekha ki, its better to improve yourself,i took that decision ki jab mai mere almost near perfection me chala jau, tabhi kisiko approach karunga, it actually kinda motivates me , and also tells me to not getting attached so easily, i dont know will it work or not , but its better be single rn , gym, padhai, ek acchi job, then i don’t think ki esab matter bhi karega .

Naah cuz when i made my moves, I got friendzoned🙂

Hahahah not funny

mujhe kya mai to janam se single hu 🤡

The best proposal isn’t a confession — it’s the wait that never ends. I’ll make her believe it’s coming — that moment, that magic — but it never will. Each heartbeat will whisper, ‘today’s the day,’ and every silence will answer, ‘not yet.’ She’ll live in the promise of a moment that never arrives — and that’s the greatest proposal of all

Coping maxx

Nicee

Trust me it doesn't get any better after that either😂

Ig he’s just a neckbeard in disguise who posted this just to karma farm

Getting someone is a very divine process ... When the stars align it happens automatically

Yes , but ig.. I am too unstable , also incan indulge in religious activities, or reading, or writing. 
Ig that's what God wants.

Did you make a move?

Idk man ,also idc now

Yeah , thanks

Man.. are people desperate and like predator? They become close and attack or leave scars on others? Feels odd to get closes... Everyone is lovely

"Female give a new perspective"!!!!! Example????

Support this, but when making friends, I feel it's helpful sometimes to not think of their gender, but just as friends. Helps to overcome the initial awkwardness and build genuine connections with people. Also helps to get away from the *beautiful girl = kash ye meri bandi hoti* mindset. I think a friend should be a friend. If it somehow turns into attraction, it's fine but to approach someone with that intention while trying to establish a friendship seems disingenuous and trust me you'll be saving yourself from a world of hurt that is the friendzone if you're open about it from the start. Don't come off too aggressive, but don't be too meek either. Let her know if there's a chance that you actually see her that way.

🤣

Chill maar, hamesha kucch na kucch to aata hi h

Yeah.. mean to be

"one day you cry for someone the other you find out why you had to go through all that" I think its the human ego which wants to give meaning to every other attempt as something to learn from and as redirection, true we either learn or get things done, but sometimes its none of the mentioned cases as well, maybe like the pain wasnt worth it(Not talking about char dev arc),maybe the painwasnt owrht it cz of our stupidity or lack of introsepction. Meh else agreed nvm.

Doesn't matter, I am warrior now and I don't have any end goal now. Thanks

I used be like this too, but I am overthinking in general now. Like where I stand and insecure..

Yes, ig overthinking is bad

Damn, thanks, it's hard getting over that one girl I used to love

Bhai bohot cringe lgta h ye comment

bhai, khya relation hei iss post ka aur comment ka !!

I have good friends, hope u have too

Yeah , I have a better solution. I will be the man which I always appreciate. The man which aspire for a better world. To help others,establish a safe place rather than be a SIMP. Doesn't matter if I get any girls or success or fame. I will go on. Brother our love for simplicity is endless, we simply need a joyful effortless motive.

Man is defined by what changes he aspire for a meaningful existence for childlike innocence 😇.

Am I really incel? Like I read on internet and it says that they objectify women and take women as extraordinarily bad. Idts, though some trait match that I don't want to engage is this anymore and focus on career

I am not really serious, not even about job or career. So it's just a shitpost ig

Deep inside ,we all know it's just a coping thing. we all do it don't we?

I don't know what your standards for being "perfect" are, but I wouldn't be that harsh on myself. Keep improving yourself but also shoot your shot when you feel like it. Because sometimes while chasing perfection, time runs out. Don't lose focus on the reason why you want to be a better person.

 
Also sometimes (and take this with a kilogram of salt), when you try to improve yourself and your condition with so much efforts, the baggage that you have for having worked yourself hard to the bone starts building pressure on your significant other if they are not over-achievers themselves. Sometimes you can start coming off as a prick, which might sound unfair to you but remember when you are finally with someone, you adapt with each-other. This becomes tough when you live your life with such strict principles. There are girls who are like that and they might fall for you. Therefore it becomes important to ask; if you find such a girl, who is as strict on herself as you are right now, are you be sure that you'll be able to maintain this for a lifetime?

Nice guys have this, better to focus on career

Amen

We all are bro

Not actually. Part of growing up is accepting everyone will find love at different points in life. If it happens at KGP, it's okay. If it doesn't, that shouldn't mean the end of it. Shoot your shot if you feel like it. If it doesn't work out, either adjust your aim or quit the game.

It's even harder to get talking after school and college

Wrong guess

Not yet In the college

Not everyone is worth your time ofcourse, trust people but from afar

Did he pull that out from his ass?

Nhi to back a jayegi ladki ka Chakar ma ladki nhi 😂

Jo aega woh dekha nhi jaega 🤭

Yes I get what you mean but idk when I was at that point in life I really started liking that pain to the point I used to seek it in some ways or other but if I could go back i wouldn't wanna change any of it... It got me to the place I am now ngl I am not at the best phase of life right now but everything has gotten more comfortable in weird ways... It's peaceful in its own way!! You get there with time I guess...

You are feeling insecure because u did not find any girl? Please correct me if I comprehend it wrong.

sorry bachha call karu😔

Who cares

Yes actually is there any other options left? We can’t even do anything on it 🫠

Yes

Then do it bro.

Yes sir

Nope , ever since I came to campus . I was earlier good at minding my own buisness, but now I lost focus so all I see are my limitations

No, why?

Yes

Most of the girls are already occupied and I lose interest when i get to know someone already has a bf. 
Also it's not like I have crush on anyone specially

bro, i can feel you, i would suggest, just go for it, if you started thinking them as your limitation, i would say just experience it once, and when you understand you are much above what you think your current limitations are, you will feel even more fullfilled, and keep it in mind everything is undercontrol until you have mental and physical sanity

Us bro us.

So u r male, was going to hit on u lol

Bro what 💀💀

The best proposal isn’t a confession — it’s the wait that never ends. I’ll make her believe it’s coming — that moment, that magic — but it never will. Each heartbeat will whisper, ‘today’s the day,’ and every silence will answer, ‘not yet.’ She’ll live in the promise of a moment that never arrives — and that’s the greatest proposal of all

After COVID the stray dogs population reached its peak on campus, they are frequently giving birth and dogs used to stay at those areas where a food stall is available, now it is inside the entire campus with significant numbers including with our academic section, where rarely you will find a food stall. chasing students in the middle of the road at night time, pooping and pissing all over hostel premises in front of doors. KGP is open for dogs without an entrance exam. Live, Eat, poop in front of classrooms and hostel rooms, roam , reproduce lots of newborn, no security action.

Title: Should ban City Bytes

Ratatouille

Reminds me of the springfest fiasco around 2010 or 2011. Don't exactly remember the year but Sunidhi Chauhan had come to kgp for the star night. She demanded that she wanted to eat chicken 65 or something like that. Some poor chap who was a 1st year associate of SF got chicken packed from Hot Bite. It used to be a small shack next to Tikka. She got severe food poisoning during her performance and was constantly puking backstage in between songs. Afterwards she got severely dehydrated and had to be given ORS. Someone else on Reddit from around that time can confirm the sequence as the memory is a bit hazy but it was ridiculous and it was the talk of the campus for a few days.

IIT Kgp-0, Amity-1

Tf is this shit, should be banned for life, send this to whatever concerned auhority there is

There's rats in food city as well

Report to FSSAI

It's actually city bites?

This should be a criminal case

Anyone can cook 

So is eating

its the same at food city but instead of the rats you see cockroaches

First the mouse bites then the city bytes

Mf that's an entire family of rats

Kharagpur aur IIT Kharagpur me jis level ka corruption hai, City Bites kuch dusre naam se aa jayega. 

Aise bhi Kharagpur town me hadh jahil log rehte hai, including the working engineers and doctors. Sabko sirf apne pocket bharne se matlab rehta hai. Log pehle mare bhi hai, zero action. 

Bhai, sabse bada example to Waldorf hai. Uska malik apni beti ke liye fake SC certificate banwaya, fir doctor banwaya. Maje se chal rahi uski dukan. Tum sab us chor ke dukan me party bhi karte ho. To fir ye RR kyu?

Bro is complaining about so many top french chefs. The honda city of this guy.

Holy shit! Alag naam hota hai bass, jagah aise hee rakhte hain yeh log. I'm just happy I didn't eat in those places, but I did eat at food city.

Title: The lack of goth girls here are driving me crazy

As a freshman boy here at KGP, I am saddened at the lack of goth girls who attend here. The majority of girls here are Lana Del Rey and Taylor Swift fangirls who seem to lack personality and originality. The underrepresentation of the goth girl subculture at KGP is likely tied to a few aspects, how it is notorious for its partying (not typically a goth girl interest), the constant fests and events (ditto), and the overall lack of diverse appeal.

I know that my fellow freshmen male brethren are also disappointed at the lack of goth mommies here, they likely just conceal their pain better than I am capable of. Every single day I wake up and do my morning prayer hoping to spot an emo goth girl somewhere around campus, but alas, to no avail. Perhaps I am merely looking in the wrong places. If anyone knows where to find them please message me ASAP. Or if you are a goth girl reading this, don’t be afraid to shoot me a DM.

I believe without finding a goth girl my mental health will continue to plummet and I’m afraid to know what I’m capable of if that happens. Any tips are much appreciated, thanks!

lol few years ago there were no girls in kgp now yall want goth girls it seems

Mausam ka effect kya? Sala jidhar dekho same post..... Ho kya gaya be?

Kamse kam post toh original daal de bhai

Bro, I was born and brought up in Purba Medinipur district, trust me as I tell you this, almost everywhere you look, you'll find goth girls 🤡

I really feel like you haven't explored all the potentials mate.

This guy is either copypasta this shit or he's a dumbass who doesn't know that it's just not easy to be a goth in India, current year. We have no Hot Topic, tattoos means you have no employment ops, piercings mean everyone is going to call you a slut, and no actual goth community that you can be a part of. So then you're stuck with being a solo goth. 

I can bet the whole country's economy that if this guy sees those few goth girls who are weird enough to be solo goth, he's gonna run as far as he can

That the mental health of a human being can depend on the number of goth girls they come across is not disturbing but quite dumb dude😂 You can have a better tolerance level imho, afterall, you seem like a human being. 

Anywayyyy

I kid you not, you definitely won't like it if she starts pulling of black magic and sh*t on you🌚

Need better moderation on this sub to protect against this kind of absolutely shit and extremely sexist posts. Also please implement some form of verification system to prevent random throwaway accounts from posting.

There are goth girls in india?? Lol. I would be even surprised to know there are Lana del Rey fan girls in india?? that too in iit kgp of all places?? No wonder the post is copied from Cornell sub because there it makes sense to me.

Dude, I was going after one girl who was lowkey goth. She had it all, was really pretty, and had some issues too due to her previous toxic relationship. Talked with her for months to ultimately get shattered myself. Took me a year to get over her. 
So do yourself a favor and focus on CP. Jab Alphagrep le jaayegi toh ladkiyon ke liye tu bhi alpha ban jaayega.

The whole country is facing an acute shortage of goth girls right now

It is quite funny that you find me creepy without knowing me. The way you talk about boys shows how weak you are. It seems like you never had good male friends, but why would anyone be a friend of a retard like you? As you clearly show your frustrations and no rational reasoning behind the hate, it seems you yourself don't have enough good qualities so that good creatures stick around you.

You don’t even know them stop judging people

Title: LBS Food

Full Nutritious

Enjoy this would be your best month in LBS

It's just like a trailer....

NGL, that bread tells me all I need to know, that this is KGP. 

I have eaten food at quite a few college hostels (3-4 IITs included, because of studies and Inter IITs) and KGP's food was the saddest, sorry. 

Like the bread is plopping down in sadness. 😬

never ever, ever ever see the food of IIT Bombay, otherwise, you will dropout to crack Bombay

bhai yaha bol ke matlab nahi hai, sab tujhe adjust karne bolenge lekin koi betterment ke liye kaam nahi karega. aur bas kisi govt college se compare kar denge. chutiye hai yaha sab, india ka best collge hai to baaki countries ke best college se compare karo, yaha ke hi jhatu se college se compare karne legenge, kabhi kisi mit ya harvard wale students ko mess food ke baare me rant karte suna hai?

Lagta hai fachhe ho

😭😭😭😭😭

Wait until they unveil their cabbage

Ye konsi sandwich hai 😭

Ghatiya… anyway LBS really has the worst food of all!

I think lbs hall mess is private so they try to maximise profits (once they removed paneer from paneer kofta). Veg dishes are essentially aloo with 2-3 small pieces of the vegetable they use for naming it. I hope you get a good Gsec for mess

This month you will be served the best food you will ever have in LBS and then after a month you will realise how shitty mess food of LBS can become. Good luck 🍀

Mess walo ne dekha or lunch ki or jyada maa chod di to show breakfast was golden period

And we have ppl working for mental health when physical health is myth

iitk ki sandwich mein aloo the😋. Aur sath mein pudina ki chutney.

Abhi toh party shuru hui hai 😋

wtf

Isiliye kgp nhi gya

Much better than ABV

I can still remember that water down ketchup

Kgp se kya umeed karte ho lol

Ohh.

Your sandwich has carrots and cucumber in em? Man, LBS has gotten much better since I left

Beautiful

No cap ,if I was served this while tired and burnt out from my lecs ,I would totally consider killing myself. Why is kgp's and Delhi's food so bad , Mumbai ,kanpur and madras are fine mostly.

wow 2 of em??? We used to get only one and one day a kid got into a fight with worker cause he's denied a second one. Good ol' days

Bro 1st Floor Mess mein to Pohe the

Well, we are once given. Everyone complained and they had to change it from the next week.

Now that LBS are gonna have only freshers, not sure how much courage will they have to protest.

Maze aa gye bhai ❤️❤️🤩🤩🤩

Don't you worry. Wait for Sunday lunch.

are the messes checking any id till now? Or anyone can go and get the food?

So called prestigious college

Welcome to the world of lbs(kgp)

i like bread butter with salt in it and burn it a little

Fucking protest. Do something don't normalize this BS

You call it lack of food we call it hungar games.

Sanbitch

And u hv to wait for 1/2 hr in a queue full of sweating ppl, u urself drenched in sweat for this🥲

I am here fromt HJB, same degraded mess food.
Today also very poor

Bruh, there aren't even fried bugs and cockroaches inside those wholesome cucumber sandwiches, I fail to see what's the issue.....

idk bro it was fricking tasty as hell even if it looks sad, so far all the LBS veg food is banging, seniors were saying itd be shit but i find it tasty asf

Edible tha kya dikkat
Kela bhi tha
But khana overall bahut kam tha

Good old days

\*week

You mean the last month ?

I wish I had taken IIT Bombay

Same with iit h.

Placement ke naam pe kuch toh seh lete loog! Yaha na placements honge na izzat se khaana.

aur ye to bhi thik hai, 2 mahine baad isse bhi kharab khana milega, ready rehna

The estimated monthly cost for room and board (housing and food) at Harvard University for the 2025-2026 academic year is around $2,100 - $2,600 for on-campus housing, and potentially higher for off-campus housing depending on location and living arrangements, according to Harvard's Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. This is based on an estimated annual cost of $18,900 for housing and $6,334 for food, totaling $25,234 per year. Dividing that by 10 months (the typical academic year) gives a monthly average of around $2,523.40. However, this can vary greatly based on whether a student lives on or off campus, and if off-campus, the specific location and living situation.

Haa

This is so funny… women halls are much better🥲

Dahi cucumber d

Sandwich which caused 2 su*ides in a span of a week at KGP

7 suicides since last year and a recent attempt of suicide too, mental one is a bigger myth, i hope setu works

Food which be called food🥹

Thanks🥹
I’ll do something about it

1 sh*t > 2 sh*t

I didn’t know that LBS food has Fried bugs and cockroaches in menu

Snacks was goated too man idk why people hate the mess

True, water is more edible than this

*day

It was much much better not sure if it was due to inter IIT

Haven't gone there, sorry.

i went to IITB during 2010 and 2018, just enjoyed mess food there.. breakfast lunch dinner.. all great.. night canteens were cheaper than kgp and 3x better quality.. they used to give shrikhand in lunch... amazing shrikhand.. much better than amul etc .. 7-8 food items at around 50-70 rs lol

purchasing power parity bhi padh lo kabhi specially food me, india me sasta milta hai

Aadat hojaegi

I wish I can get a girls hall🥹

? just an advice.never use suicides for ur lame jokes
second thing refrain from sharing wrong info, one suicide happened , the other one was an accident

C'mon, kuch bhi 
Being a freshman, appreciate things you get in the initial days. The induction days will be the most chill and happening days for your kgp life. 

'learn to appreciate things the way they are- will help you in a long run'
Abhi se agar complain karoge to abhi bahut kuch dekhna baaki he yaha, kaise handle karoge bhai

True but this also needs similar attention maybe corruption is going on

Hamare yahan (dtu) mai bhi same haal hai, sab govt colleges mai same scene😔

It's a healthy protein source, you'll soon get used to the crunchy texture.

*meal

[removed]

Shrikhand sahime bhot accha tha😌

How much? 😀😀.... 118/- per day is equivalent to that?.. Bf price is roughly ₹15/-... You got 4 bread.. they are lucky to see some cucumbers there...😀😀😀... Stay logical,  say logical....

I feel, per day cost should be no less than 500/- to get proper food.

is there a way to screw these people?
How a system can be so sh*tty

I am truly sorry, but isn’t it worst?
Why is nobody bothering to fix such things

I guess things will be getting worse🥲

Hmm Atleast DTU sandwich has more veggies

Hmm, I think so, that’s what they told us, also my roll number starts with 25

Ohh Any cheap ways to get decent food which not has these kind of protein sources

*bite

Dm

Chale firse lol... But now entering IIT Bombay campus would be very difficult... It was difficult even back then... But I was on 1- official trip, 2- tech fest during 2010

500 is too much, the hostel in my jee days had a mess for 6k per month(4 meals a day), it just felt like home. considering this is a govt institute the price can come down to 170-180 per day which is more than enough

Pehle din se hi complaint?

No

As a fresher myself it wasn't that bad. What are you expecting in a hostel mess

[deleted]

[deleted]

Of my taste?

Waise i was not a student, i interned here for close to 2 months recently. I had shrikhand for first time in mess and it was too good😌. Tbh campus life here is very vibrant, i will miss it fr sure!

6k per month? Which year and which IIIT? It must be per semester if it is IIT Kgp and before 2010.

I know 500/- is too high but meet your all expectations with luxury food... Even a road side dhaba,  you won't get veg meal less than ₹80 .. so taking that into account...  50 for bf, 100 for lunch and dinner, 25/- for snacks... Perhaps  around 275/- per day would give you decent food. 

I am not the person who only want to criticize... Just trying to see the root cause of such horrible food. I think student body could give a thought on it.

Technically not first day

So should I suffer silently?

A bread that didn’t pretended like sandwich

So let things go their own way?

Yeah sure the authorities are trying so much I understand surely... Just like toxic profs are trying to manage so many research programs and classes and still have to do the honour of behaving humanely... LBS Food IS BAD (senior)

Don't try to be the devil's advocate here, managing 18k students also comes with the largest work staff. It's not decent food compared to other top IITs and mind you this is the oldest of them all. Visit MMM and see for yourself, it's not a thing to be proud of more than be ashamed of. 5th yr here

So you are a senior?

Yes I stated in those mini skyscraper hostels... In kgp also we will have such hostels now... Vsrc2 is an example

why would i be eating in a iiit mess. rest aside it was in a metropolitan city. 200rs per day is sufficient taking kgp is cheap compared to the place i was in

Raise your voice even if to highest authority but don't lose your calm over it and try to find an alternative/solution so you can survive here.

Do NOT use the word "suffer" to refer to this

Which year?

Title: What the hell?

If DR causes discrimination then also take away Institute Silver Medals and President's Medal.

I've seen people write their 100/100 of boards math in their CV. You expect a person to not write their DR in the CV?

i had written top 1% of indian population

Not from iitkgp but lot of IITs simply don't have department rank altogether coz students take things into their hands a lot based on these things (ifykyk).

Plus people can take easy courses and score max while those who take harder ones might struggle especially during later years when electives open up

In mech dept we were not provided with DR and we requested to provide DR many times. But profs refused. Why a hard working student should suffer? I don't know what discrimination is there in this thing.

BC its the individual's interest to write whatever he wants. If the recruiter feels its irrelevant they ll ignore or reject the application. Ye bache log bas yaha internet me rone laayak hai. Mess ki khana theek nahi.toilet me paani nahi....yaha rote hai....fight karne ki koi spirit hi nahi.....bas anonymously peldo kuch bhi....... haaaatttt.... hamare time mein gaand phaad dete the.....

CGPA aleardy is a measure of academics, Dep rank isn't. SIlver medals and president's medals is for CGPA, not dep ranks

I guess what rancho said after their photoshoot in 3 idiots actually applies here and it's a good move

They just simply don’t want the hassle of validating so many students.

Jealousy, jealousy

Is it a rule or just suggestion?

The irony is, the Placement portal shows the category beside the CGPA (Idk why it has the category listed?!)
And
It can be easily passed on to companies

Well even if you don't mention the DR directly in your CV, few companies, like HFTs, are just going to rank CVs for shortlisting based on your CG, so doesn't make a huge difference either way. I know this because I saw the test and internship shortlist of companies during the intern season this year, not each and every student mentioned their DR in the CV, but the list appeared to be sorted strictly on the basis of CG of students for a particular company, making it very evident, and for a few other companies the interview shortlists were given to the top few department rank holders, even though all of them hadn't mentioned it in their CV. Also, one company explicitly asked to provide the DR in a form.

When your department profs are so sadistic highest CG is around 8.7😂, DRs are the only way to curb inter department discrimination a bit, ofc it’s not gonna be like real cg but at least it’s something

They should stop taking exams altogether.. ya fir sabhi ko EX dedo

How is earned credit a basis of discrimination?

[deleted]

should have included 'Rank 1 in sperm race' too

What😂

How about 0.1 percent

[deleted]

Well you can choose electives. So it is also a part of the strategy to get good scores. I don't think that's wrong. Also electives are only there in last year when cg is hardly affected unless you f*ck up real bad or get extremely good score. So major cg build up is done at the end of 3rd year only

Which year?

if I am not wrong, silver medal is awarded to the student with the highest cgpa in the department, so it is for dep ranks

That was a different situation. In the movie, the ranks of all students were publicly displayed. Here, we are talking about releasing the ranks of only top 5 DR holders. I don't suppose releasing top 5 names should be counted as discrimination to other students. After all, those students worked their ass off so they deserve some reward

It's a rule. A stupid one but yeah.

It is passed on to the companies. Well, some companies.

CGs vary with department, so it’s really unfair

You saw them cheating? You have any proof or just blabbering?

🤣🤣🤣🤣

editing right now

Hell yeah!!

Ok say someone wants to do PhD in a subject- it's preferable to have certain courses (which could be hard) over other courses that are easy. Some folks can't always simply max their CGs

One thing people don't understand is that easy course is easy for everyone and hard course is difficult for everyone. Also what I have seen is that some profs do absolute grading in easy electives which anyway make it hard

Graduated this yr

Yes silver medal is for top cg scorer

They do have the reward of a higher CGPA, high CGPA opens a hell lot of opportunities, releasing the topper's list will not do anything but start making others feel insecure. And what kind of reward is this 'your name is in the top 5 or name is in the top 10', that list's gonna change anyways so what's the point??

Wth! Then what's the point of getting DR1?

Well, the companies I'm speaking of, also shortlist from one department only and the entire process is a bit unfair 🥲🥲

common dont be ignorant ..u want a proof hahahaha

no daddy, lets suppose your a 5k ranker...that puts you around 0.0003333% of the indian population <3

Ohhh i see

Yea yeah, HFTs I get but DRs are the only hope some people have of getting shortlisted

See what I know there is cheating in placements and intern exam. But for sem exams? I don't think so. Infact I have seen how strict the invigilation is and even a guy was forced to restart the exam because he cheated. So I don't think someone can get DR 1,2,3 through cheating. Getting a top rank in dept is not easy if you think so. You can cheat in 1...2...3 exams...and to become a topper you need to cheat in all the exams which is not at all possible. Also you can atleast pass through cheating. Getting top scores is not possible at all. I myself scored good marks in several subjects even close to full sometimes and I know the hard work you need to put into it to get that. Also how will you cheat in BTP, MTP, Seminar? I genuinely want to know. Do you know any real such cases?

[deleted]

But you have a 5k ranker every year, who is accounted for in the Indian Population so you're overcounting 🥀

W

Let's mass mail with this as a Template, we are with you

Edit: they didn't even bother to get his name right ffs

Big W.

W

I have a different view on this thing. 
 
This erp email is a professional email that is supposed to be straight to the point . 
 
The purpose of the email was to deliver ACTIONABLES which in this case is the news of POSTPONING AN EXAM 

Many students dont even read these descriptive emails , they check the subject lines so this is why it is straightforward/ 

Subject lines are meant to be catchy and TO THE POINT , irregardless of the situation 
 
And as far as the tributes go , the institute has mourned his demise and literally PAUSED all academic activities for 21.04. 
 
What more do we possibly want ?? 
 
A Central Govt body has all of its administrative tasks cancelled over a dude who took his life for whatever reasons btw...

I did check if the email had been AI generated like last time. It wasn't. They reflected on the outrage last time. This is also problematic. It should have been two separate emails.

W

Is everyone here new? Last time people cared, the institute made an example of it. As a student, all you can do is keep quiet.

W

could someone quickly summarise this, mera hi man nahi karraha itna lamba padhne ka admin toh spam mein daal de...

Han yaar, dekhke ithna khoon khaul raha tha mera, honestly W guy fo sending such a calm and strong reply mai hota tho gaali deta

Could you elaborate on what the institute did last time?

skimming karna tho seekh le mere bhai, it's not that hard to read the key points

I knew the guy who died, we were friends in first year. He was genuinely a nice person, and as far as his academic situation goes, he had good grades and was sorted for summer interns... I just cannot understand why the guy would want to end his life...

bhai log serious cheeze tak nahi padh paate 🤦🏻‍♂️

Title: Rain and flowers

KGP has taught me the value of spring and autumn.

I'm from Himachal where the trees are majorly evergreen coniferous, and don't really change from Season to season. 

Don't get me wrong, at home the trees are the most majestic I've seen, forests are absolutely gorgeous and the snow capped peaks will beat anything in terms of natural landscape, but I never knew how amazing it is to see every tree shed, grow, and bloom at once. 

When I came to kgp and saw the actual impact that the seasons have on trees and plants in general I was genuinely awestruck, you HAVE to look up at the road to Nalanda on peak spring, where absolutely every tree is having some sort of flowers, especially those really tall ones with bright red flowers, it legitimately looks deliberately decorated like a festival. 

And the fall in Autumn is actually seriously drastic too, the bare trees everywhere make for quite the scene from the TSG lake.

TL;DR, didn't know spring and autumn were not exaggerated in books. Pleasantly surprised.

Thanks for sharing this 😊!

Miss those days ❤️😀plz keep posting pics

Please post more pics. I almost cried looking at that pic. I miss those days, life was so good back then. All friends were available just a door away. So many extra curricular events to watch, so much bakchodi. 

The rain was so good, clean roads, no potholes, no traffic, no road rage. Life is not so good after getting out of kgp.

Used to smoke cigarette here every time before entering the class during mid/end sems. Good old days!

Mental asylum tha aur hain bhi.. !

Rain kab hua ?

Yaar tumlog kitne ache college me rehte ho, hum dusre college wale koode jaisi jagah me, good for you all, bad for me😭
Na placements hai na internships paisa aur barbaad.

+ Coffee and patties.

I don't know about books but sometimes in my poetry I use spring and autumn to represent welcoming and letting go.

If you are staying at KGP watching all the trees shedding leaves and then blooming again is really mesmerizing.

I have been to Kashmir and saw the chinar trees, locals said that during autumn it looks like it pales all around with those leaves being scattered and I saw the pictures were way beautiful.

Here is one place that I like a lot in KGP, it's in front of the old building. The Bougonvilla trees.

Sure :)

Will be posting. KGP turned to home for many of us far from home. Rain is still good. ;)

Still the legacy is being carried ahead I guess.

Naaice :)

Nahi Bhai mere pass ek hai, dusre ka kya karuga mai aap hi rakho.

Title: Bro what happening in RP ??

I heard something

it’s tragic to see a suicide more so you had to find via posting on Reddit. Back in our days a Suicide equates to mass protests , diro being pulled up and questioned , closure of depts work. legit the then diro cried on stage to gain sympathy.

[deleted]

Guys you know what...all the seniors in this sub no matter how fucked your life was please motivate your juniors be it mtech btech phd...Being lively and giving hope to your juniors doesn't make them delusional and nor does it make you unsuccesful I didnt get placed from an isro college(iist if cg>7.5 direct isro job)but i had seniors who told me that its okay and i shouldnt worry about job or life as long as i stay true to my studies and have fun but sadly majority people here think of sports, cultural activites as a burden. Help your juniors make networks, don't fucking demotivate someone from doing something extra curricular just because you don't have the capability to not do anything other than academics.
I am so sorry for that guy...Imagine being a graduate of one of the top 5 iit and still not having self belief and it's not his fault and it's not a suicide it's murder. 
Rip.

It's high time to bring back DC++..

Why does this happen so often in iit kgp
Sorry if I sound rude

3rd yr guy suicided.

Kgp administration has always been shit… 

all it takes is mandatory personal counselling sessions with a therapist for every student… or atleast evaluations & screenings to keep a tab.. professional help can go a long way to change lives of the students. 

I was a student there once… & if only I had a professional help to discuss my problems It would have helped me ton in making my life so much better.

[removed]

Damn! I feel sad for these people who take their own life nobody knows the perfect reason but giving away your life, rather than giving yourself time. It’s just very awful. I’m just thinking how his parents might be going through right now.

suicide?

[deleted]

Why suicide? Which year/branch?

What's RP actually I'm new in iit

That's so pathetic and sad

sad

The usual

woahhh

iit guwhati or iit kgp 
mtech ke liye konsa lun

iss it kgp that bad 
somebody guide plz

3rd year ece

BC Diro ko bulao aur pelo. Also whatever ME prof cunt who was responsible for this.

Last time students protested, they made an example out of it.

nothing of such things happening now is really sadenning thing, even after these many suicides happened this alone year, nothing has changed on the way the proceeding go, no measures taken, no proper reasons given on the incidents! Just shutting the news and silence the topic, and then the same age old mail( which has a fixed template with name and dep been changed)

this institute is screwed up horribly beyond repair. that is what i came to know.

I am in a dogshit college and even my parents have quite high hopes from me that are borderline unfeasible sometimes, can't imagine the pressure somebody in a top IIT like IIT-KGP must have. Crazy world!

Bhai jab koi itna ghiswake mehenat krke aaye to vo sochta h ab to life set h but jab placement nhi lgti to gussa aur vo sb to aata hi h but suicide isn't the option

The environment is so depressing. I just resigned from there as the environment around me bothered me so much and I also got another chance from different institute. It's really worrisome.

Same, i am from iist !

Hello Piyush bhaiya !!

And some bhajans

Wow, I didn’t know you guys don’t have DC++ anymore. Since when has DC++ been gone?

how will that help

Kab ban hua ye?

What's dc++?

No support system to students and corrupt faculty who don't care even if all the students die as long as they can cover it up.

4th yr

For real? Main to join krne wala tha is saal. Man, this is so sad.

No way is this true? Can't find any news on this

>Kgp administration has always been shit…

Yes

Fr?

4th year Mech

A hall

most depressing hall and most toxic people live in RP

Nope. He's a 4th year ME guy.

He just joined 3 weeks back so I don't think it'll solve anything

how

kaun ho tum and kaha ho abhi?

It was still there when I was in 2nd year or so, but reduced content, since ultimately what makes up the DC++ network is the students using it

Broo how yo dont know dc++?, our local LAN network, its like this reddit only but with more functions and original junta

Was he 4th yr then or now? Which batch

Happened just now

Dude ofcourse, everyone would think about his parents bcz they must have worked hard for him to study and get a good place like IIT which major of the population dreams of and then be successful to make them proud. Now all of that is just gone for them. You or I or others don’t know the back story of why this guy took this step but must be a major reason, could be family, could be academic pressure.

That's a horrible things to say unless you have abusive parents or something

Yes

Bro I was thinking of studying mech .....is it that bad for opportunities?

Hall name kya h

Agreed. RP is a literal shithole. Looks and feels like a seventh world country…

Why is it not same like rk?

Replace RP with KGP and you will still be correct.

Is it? Cuz everywhere people are saying it's 3rd year ece, 4th going this year

That must be hard. I can’t imagine life without DC++. Since KGP is effectively a big village with no city life or anything (I am not sure how it is now), DC++, along with being part of multiple sports and events, did help me a lot.

The deplorable circumstances and living conditions are majorly the institute’s fault. Have you seen RP? It looks like a seventh world shithole. Worst hall in the institute.

That’s what you decided to take from that?

Levels of dumbness

Now is then brother. 2022 batch

Is there any kind of ragging?

Everyone thinks of the parents who put in soooo much hard work when it was the student who worked hard, wrote the exams and got in, only to be killed by the pressure from their parents or the pressure that they put upon themselves. I don't feel sorry for the parents even a little bit, everyone makes it about them when it was the student who suffered the most until he killed himself. None of the people here know what a suicidal person actually goes through before taking the step, and start shedding tears for the parents/friends of the dead instead. All my sympathies go out to the person who died, may he finally rest in peace.

Do you not realise how selfish that sounds? imagine how your child would feel if you told them everything you’re doing is so that they can make you proud in return.

Omg you're a genius, how did you figure that out 😱

[deleted]

just do what you want, kgp seniors are very negative, especially the old one would even say that ece is trash in kgp

There are few core core companies that come, in the 24-25 placement, only 1 psu took mech students for example. You'll You'll definitely get get something something if you have good cg though.

Rp = rajendra prasad hall of residence

I know him personally. So yeah he's a 4th year ME.

Did you people have no alternative for it?

Real ragging is done by cutthroat competition, lack of jobs & careers. Brain meltdown is real.

Probably cause of the CDC pressure

Why did I get downvoted lol, everybody knows that eng. college seniors are pieces of sh*t

agreed , but is that person still alive to feel all those emotions , no right ? but his parents hv to bear the pain till they die . not all parents look at their kids as investment , some are truly attached and only care about their son and not his salary or college or anything

Much immaturity 乁⁠(⁠ ⁠•⁠_⁠•⁠ ⁠)⁠ㄏ

Who ?

You seem like a fresher or a sophomore....... Seniors say that because they've faced the CDC season and they know what it's like, you'll find out soon when you yourself face CDC. And honestly, aside of placements/interns, academically KGP is indeed trash, because the teaching is mostly not up to the mark, and grading is unfair. Have you ever heard a CSE senior say that it's not worth it? No right? That's because their internship and placement stats are good for obvious reasons, whatever be the situation.

[deleted]

But he would have reasons to die.....who wanna die at such a young age .....and did he not get placed

Sorry to hear that man 😞😞 RIP

why he took such type pf steps ?

No, you'll always be able to get by. If you want to be able to buy a BMW right after graduation then sure there might be a lack of jobs to that end. Mostly it is due to distorted thinking in the mind of students blowing their problems out of proportion, they are out of touch with reality

There is no reason which justifies this. Think of the people he leaves behind:(

most are not, I'm still getting taunted and yelled by my parents for perusing BS from here, when I could have gotten BTech. It's just sad and super scary for someone who is going to come in a week. I hope I find good grounded company so I can stabilize myself.....but seeing the things, it won't be easy huh

[deleted]

[deleted]

He just got into his final year. Its not about placements.

Can I dm you??

"If you want to be able to buy BMW right after graduation"

You just summed up every "academic pressure" suicide case.

I am not justifying anything. 
Just stating what could have been the possible reason for this irreversible step

dw man , you'll do great , just a doubt , u cud have chosen bs from iitk atleast , there there is branch change toh kuch hopes rakh skta tha

No it was just me. I wrote 'suicide 😢' and thought it's unnecessary to write the comment, so deleted but after deleting I saw that I have got reply.

Come to kgp ,soon u will realise something dark

[deleted]

Pre-final. He was a dual guy.

Then why? Any suicide note or family problems leading to this.....or least concern of bad academics

OK

Not trying to downplay or trivialize the pressure students face. It's OK if someone feels that way, and they deserve help if they do. Just trying to say that any kind of perceived academic failures are not the end of the world, although it may feel like it, I think it's possible to keep a level head through it if they can find a counsellor or even a friend to talk to about it. We should try to create the conditions where the students have support groups they feel comfortable to share their feelings. We should take steps to destigmatize mental health

had it just one above did not get it, would have preferred that too. Well I would have preferred an IISER the most, but they are starting their counselling a day before the reporting so low chance now

Spill the beans bro please 🥺

================================================================================

Title: What's the debate?

I see a confusion in this comment section where people are under impression that this "debate" has a communal angle, which is not true. Attaching the link to the full article - 

Thanks to u/BrownMidget for reading the whole article and summarizing it here!

I don't think people are hating the traditional dress code. From just reading the dress code it seems like they are just being tooo specific and that's why there's debate. 

I think if its just " wear a formal white kurta or saree appropriate to the occassion". It would've been fine?

Like I as a person won't wear a cotton saree again but I can get a white kurta and wear it multiple times? I don't want to buy a white saree that is sooo specific. If I buy a white saree, I would like it to have like a really nice golden zari pallu. 

If you want things to be so particular, provide the costumes on rent or something.

Yea this sounds fucking horrible. Why in the world is it so specific??? Its a celebration for the students yar, don't make it so boring

Lmaooooo what’s even the issue here. Also how does it spark debate when IIT-K does it but not another college like IIIT-H. Sure it’s a pain in the butt to get good quality kurtas these days, but how can you not find them more comfortable than stuff like suits?

What no Khaki chaddi as well?

It’s difficult to handle cotton sarees! Plus, if not draped well, it tends to bulge and make you look fat! 
Atleast plain georgette sarees allow karna chahiye imo!

CONTEXT TIME! 
Since the entire article isn’t posted here, maybe because Print media doesn’t have it…let me be the Lord and Saviour Dr.Context:

So surprisingly, a pleasant one that is, it is NOT COMMUNALLY MOTIVATED NOR DOES IT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH WEARING WHITE ON AN AUSPICIOUS OCCASION. 
The entire debate is because several LGBTQ folks feel that “Dress codes curbs ‘Personal freedom and choice’” and that it is not inclusive and regressive of them to force people into ‘Boys’ and ‘Girls’ like in case of Non-Binary folks. Which has led to many such students to boycott the function altogether.

The other point being made is that the dress is so particular and specific that it is difficult for students, especially those with limited means, to get these items specially for a single occasion. 

I do not want to start any sort of a slugfest here but I personally feel that there should be a general uniform colour but dressing style and specific accessories should not be mandated.

EDIT: I am not a student at IIT-KGP nor am I smart enough to even be on this sub, let alone a college as good as IIT-KGP!

so the "white" colour code in our culture is generally only worn on someone's death and diwali is a festival so that might be the reason

One of the happiest days of your life and you dress up for a funeral.

Dk why people hate their own culture so much and are ashamed about it. This doesn't even have a religious undertone.

During our times, the dress code was formals , blue colour for men and sarees or formals for girls. That used to feel like being progressive and modern. 

This kurta pajama etc gives the vibe of "our sanatan dharam kulcha was the best kulcha, need to revive it"

If there are any final year seniors here, do enlighten us!

So they removed the option of formal white shirt and black pants?

What's the debate about? Seems like a pretty good choice for convocation.

Bhai debate kya hai isme? Ye to statement hai kewal...
🧐

Sahi to Hain.

Somebody died?

Diwali hai ya maiyyat?

Moodiji incoming on convocation

Boomers just need a reason to get offended

Oh! It used to be called Traditional Day in our college. Very normal for youths to celebrate in such way. Why is it an issue?!

Ok if I was one who have to fix this shit.. i would have said.. 

Wear the dress we have asked or stay fuck out of convocation..

You will get your certificates.. marksheets delivered..

Purpose served.. I am inviting you as a guest for the celebration.. I have some expectations..

I am not taking away your pride.. Your results will stay with you for a life..

If this was a party that i am Throwing
. You had no choice to decide the menu..

[deleted]

Iit k nhi iit kgp, hume unse mat milaye

That additional I is the problem Mr brown sahib/sahiba

I don't usually wear those things. So I don't find them comfortable. Comfortable would be when they wear what they feel like, wouldn't it?

Is Your mom also coming?

Also, genuine question, are they going to come and feel people's sarees? Because there are many different kinds of cotton and most affordable sarees these days are made of blends anyway. It's going to be pretty hard to tell who's wearing a cotton saree and who isn't.

Sounds logical!

Pinning this to the top in order to avoid "People hate their own culture" bullshit.

Link to full article -

Update - Unfortunately, can't pin the above comment.

In our IIT we had kurta pyjama and kurta salwar for all students. IIT Kgp should do that . Problem solved

Agar ye reason ha to bring back bullying

Matlab kuch bhi

!gif

😂😂 (sorry)

White is auspicious. That's why most of our gods and goddesses adorn white clothing with coloured borders. White is adorned during mourning to show the purity of emotions during the loss of dear ones. So white is no way related to death, but connected to pureness. That's the reason why politicians opt for white clothing to showcase them as pure.

good pov

This dress code is common in such national Institutes

Following a culture and Rubbing/forcing the culture are two different things

Not the culture of a majority of us : )

If you force people to do anything, expect them to push back. Culture isn't a status thing. It changes with time.

Graduated this year and no idea about the debate, but I sure as hell find the dress code to be a massive pain

[deleted]

Some queer folks don’t want gendered garment simple. That’s it. The institute can just ask those students to wear whatever uniform they like men’s or women’s assuming both are same white coloured kurta or saree

I never said it was done for comfort. I am just saying they happen to be comfortable so what's really the harm.

Wait there is an actual difference? I just thought people liked typing 3 letters for added emphasis, there is an iit-k?? I actually can't keep up with how many iits there are (T_T)

I doubt whether they would be able to differentiate bw pure cotton and blend cotton!

I am not from an IIT, but another Central Government Institute. Our institute provided the kurta and saris.

>ha to bring back bullying

What?

I know and that doesn't make it not a funeral look.

Previously western gown was forced on convocations, how was that fine and this isn't?

Yep, exactly. Forcing a culture is never good.

Pretty inconvenient I see!

What does their Aadhar read? If Man or Woman, then they have to follow the rule. If it's written as other or Trans, then they can ask the institution for an alternate clothing option.

people don't wear fancy clothes for comfort, you want to look your best for convocation

Iit kanpur and iit kharagpur 💀

IIT K — HC Verma wala IIT

IIT Kgp — Sundar Pichai wala IIT.

Bruh 🗿

I mean you won’t associate whites in my place as funeral look, so no one really cares

Same kind of debate would’ve happened back then too… we don’t even know what happened… dressing is about comfort… asking and rubbing are different things.

It’s their convocation… obviously there would be a debate. It’s not about the culture here, I’m talking about any kinda attire being rubbed.

According to Nalsa judgement self identification is valid. Also not everyone wants a surgery some people are just non binary

I am saying comfort is a +1, why would you object to comfort

where are you from? You search for Indian funerals and everyone is wearing a white kurta. White kurtas specifically is funeraly, not white coloured clothes

>Same kind of debate would’ve happened back then too… we don’t even know what happened… dressing is about comfort… asking and rubbing are different things. 
> 
>It’s their convocation… obviously there would be a debate. It’s not about the culture here, I’m talking about any kinda attire being rubbed.

All formal functions across the world have an attire that needs to be followed. It is to ensure that there is some dignity / respectability to the occasion. People will come in tracks, shorts and nightsuits otherwise.

Rather than specify what should not be worn, it is easier to restrict it to what can be worn. That is the reason to do this. Politicization of this is stupid. Even the change to indian formals instead of western formals is fine.

Ah alright I see your point and I agree.

But some occasions call for a predefined attire. Some jobs even require you to wear clothes on a regular basis according to some guidelines. Maybe the guidelines shouldn't be as narrow as they have set it here.

>any kinda attire being rubbed.

Lets not go there.

Nope. Nalsa is for trans people. If you are trans, then make your stance clear to the government and the institution. You can't just take advantage of both with the responsibility of none.

[deleted]

Not here really.. there’s no dress code or anything per se, just the body is covered in white shroud, that’s the only white there is

Yeah… politicising the issue is stupid. 

Now let’s see who’s politicising it.

Convocation already has a dress code. Formals with the convocation attire, black long coat with a hat.

Restricting the options to a few does spark a debate. 

Politicising it is restricting it specifically to their choice instead of formals.

Tracks and tees… buhahahahahaha…. Come up with some better points.

Nalsa applies to non binary individuals too.

That's cool, I understand that... But why is that an object of debate? When somebody sets suit related formals as dresscode I don't see anyone complaining they wanted to wear kurta. This is such a non argument to have ffs, what would you even achieve here lol.

Non-binaries are also tagged under transgenders as the "third gender". But to have NALSA applied to you, you need to declare yourself as the third gender in all official documents. Otherwise, it is not applicable to you.

Title: Rona araha hai

If you were in the medieval period, you sure as hell wouldn't be a knight. You'd prolly be 8 before you died of plague or simple fever. Enjoy whatever you're doing bro.

So a lawless, backward world where most people died by 30; a broken failed world with scattered remnants of humanity scraping for survival, or the time where we've made sufficient progress to live reasonably well off yet not too far as to have brought about our own destruction.

I very much prefer the present.

Title: Exposing Scams by POCs at IIT KGP

This is in DTU, we can do the same in IIT Kharagpur (Rajib Maity) and CC director@iitkgp.ac.in (Suman Chakraborty). Full exposure coming soon.

Go get em girllll

Please please do this 🙏🙏

Good initiative. Stay safe, there have been crusaders who ran into a few stumbling blocks. I'd recommend a little more secrecy till you've not actually outed them all

Please email directly to the director. He takes these issues very seriously. This needs to be exposed

Many had declared their coming. Alas, they were never heard from again.

I've experienced placecoms in KGP misuse their authority, both as a student appearing for campus interviews as well as a campus interviewer.

Har jagah p cell fielding lag rhi hai

I am a friend of a placecomm, and at this moment I genuinely feel bad for this placecomms, 
Itna thankless job hai, ektoh profs ke side se tension for regular attendance fir companies ki hr itna pareshan krti hai, I have genuinely saw him ki how he was worried about his companies, saw him mailing, calling complete stopped socialising just to save the time, and fir bhi log scammer bolte hai, almost 10 placecomms are not sorted yet, if they can pull out scams so easily, they saare day 1 par sort hojate aur poora campus khaali baitha rehta, saare logo ko placecomm se favours bhi chaiye but jab khudki naakami ki wajah se interview nahi nikalta hai toh gaali bhi placecomms deni hai, because of our esteemed students who first accept the offers and then reject the offers unki wajah gaali Placecomms khaate hai, tum interview me jo idhar udhar bol ke aate ho uski wajh se gaali Placecomms khaate hai... 

Agr tumhare pass proofs hai toh please go ahead and take necessary action and jab sab proved hojaye tb batao, faaltu naam kharke already stressed logo ko aur mentally torcher mat karo, they are also our batchmates, and if u saying ki unki shortlist kaise aati hai easily, so bhai woh placecomms hai, placecomm banne ke kiye 300+ log apply krte hai, insti ka sabse important aur bada por hai, jo bante hai unki profile ek baar without placecomm dekho, fir tumhe samajh aaega

jaldi crow

I wanna know what did he do?

Brilliant! Wish you the best of luck

It's been a week, when will you??

Has been a thing since so long. One of the main reasons I didn't go for placements. Good job. But take care to not leak your identity. It will only be tough for you. I appreciate your approach but corruption is deeply rooted in our society and you are not the first person to call them out. What happens next is something all of us know. So take care brother. Hope you succeed. 💖

Though as true as that is, the opportunity to bend the rules a little in their own favor is what motivates an unpaid team that has to work for a POR with so little weight.

Take that away, and you hurt their efficiency and drive, creating a bigger problem on the hiring front. From getting companies and to just go above and beyond the bare minimum.

[removed]

As it was pointed out by someone else, this thankless job will have no takers in future years. 

The only incentive is the advantage they get in knowing the recruiters which might aid their own journey or that of those they are near to. 

Anywho. Go ahead. All the best.

nothing will happen bhaiya, yha pe bhi kuch nhi hua, waapas se wahi chal rha jaisa pehle chal rha tha. Ek meet ki bhi baat ki thi admin ne to show proofs related to these scams vo bhi nhi hua.

Is it a normal practice for engineering colleges in India to have students involved in placement process? Seems like a lose-lose situation for everyone...

Is this a threat to placecoms to give you an offer? Or genuinely you want to expose them?

KGP Placecoms be ready

Sapne suhane...
Kuch karke dikha... Lol... Reddit post to sab kar sakte

Idt kuch hoga

a "friend" of placecomm :)

jub bakchodi karni hai toh itna toh sehna padega. 

Placecoms are doing their job and we are doing ours. They are doing partiality when we are the batchmates too, then why don't we expose the partiality from our end. It's not that we are not the students of IIT KGP

Bhai log placecomms se setting karva ke room se test dete hai aur voh test doosre logo se dilvate hai . Yaha evident hai misuse. Apna test toh voh log dilwate hi hai doosro se

May I know what have you planned to do if no placements?

Yeah, that is exactly what motivates babus and netas to become corrupt and screw our country.

This is so true.

Gymk work is all gandha majduri for students jo honestly waisa kuch kam nhi ayega.

Log bus isliye karte hai, kyuki IIT ke andar woh POR se kuch masti bhi kar pate h.

But honestly, its like 99% work, and 1% being able to have fun with the advantages.

 
Also, iss bar toh maine bhi suna hai place comms ka khud bura halat hai.

The “advantage” you glorify is so overused recruiters spot it faster than a KGP POC spots free merch.

The placecoms’ “genius” tweaks since the COVID those fixes so dumb they’re obvious to the public and companies alike have left KGP with 1 opening for every 3 at other top IITs and if those “learnings” keep getting passed down, that gap will only widen. And calling it a “thankless job” while running crores-worth of fraud? The times companies tried booking you for idiocracy, only for the chairman to bail you out for the pretty and the pettiness of it, could fill a register. But that’s the one record you’ll always lose.

yeah its stupid. the work of HR is passed onto students and professors

Haan bhai ab woh bhi insaan aur students hi hai, toh i believe woh bhi apna stand rakhne ka chance toh deserve karte hi hai

I am working on my startups + contracts with US/UK companies

Do give an alternative then.. reform isn't possible without numbers. How does one get different people with different ideologies and goals under one umbrella to work towards something? Incentivization makes that possible. People crying about corruption is naivete, you can't eliminate corruption that is counterproductive. You just need to keep it in check, and ensure it stays within a limit.

Can I dm you regarding this?

Corruption is a poor excuse for building an incentive to work.

A few years back, I was part of a recruitment team visiting different IITs for recruitment. 
A day before the interviews when we realised that there was mass cheating in online tests facilitated by invigilators(who were probably placecoms), the VP of our division almost called off the drive until we(KGP alumni) pleaded and promised that we will be disregarding the test scores and shortlisting based on resume reading - which took us the entire night. 
Even after that, we saw placecoms withholding a few candidates we had shortlisted and pushing us a few of their friends - something we didn't experience in other IITs.

Our division never went back to KGP again for recruitment.

If placecoms in other IITs can conduct themselves with integrity and drive results at par or better than KGP, then I don't see why KGP ones need an incentive of corruption for it. 
 
It's sad to see that people like you have normalised this to an even greater extent now.

Yeah

Title: Kgp couples everywhere on campus 😆

👏

I literally saw a couple kissing in front of main building. No joke, It wasn't even that late. It was like 8pm or smth. I was coming from Maggu room from a club selection and I saw a guy in Atletico kit kissing a girl in Milan jersey. It was kind of like a hi (like the girl just walked to him while waving at him) kiss. My jealousy was through the roof ngl. Like where is the barca representation in ur kiss? Barca literally won the league last season. Neither of Atletico or milan won their respective leagues

Ek couple form Krna toh me bhi deserve krta hoon

The shot looks good, jokes aside

Kaha Ka shot hai?

Freedom hai

Just a kiss. Go towards vsrc through the back side after 11pm. You'll also see things other than a simple kiss.

Umm you wear the barca jersey and kiss the boy...assert dominance

Bro turned kissing scene into a ucl match 😭💀

Near food city

I once saw a mysterious figure near nalanda at 2am smth. I was there to fill water but saw a mysterious two headed, four limbed figure performing a wierd ritual of some sort where one of its head was making noises in the dark. I thought it was scary for me but turns out the mysterious figure was scared asw. Kgp is creepy man

No offense gng, but milan ain't in the UCL 💔🥀

Nah. Girls from nearby nalanda halls are more scary.

Title: WTF happening in this college

This template is almost ready to be posted again for the next person. The same one was used for the people before him, with a different name, picture, and department. There are no follow-up posts on what exactly happened.

[deleted]

If something like this happens, it becomes a debate topic among my friends as to why such things only happen in KGP. Someone needs to do a concrete case study on this matter. Is KGP truly cursed? Or do the suicides at other IITs not come to light?

Ho gaya bhai. Bass itna hee institute kar sakta hai. Template mein photoframe badal sakta hain iss se jyada kuch nahi, Tata bye bye. Aise abhi kitne aur marenge tab bhi ye hijli detention camp waisa ka waisa bana rahega.

Bhai ye bnda to mere saath class 11-12 me padta tha, never knew he was the one, 12th ke baad mere dosto se zyada banti nhi thi to maine baat nhi kiya, i knew he got some top iit but, RIP man, may you find happiness in the afterlife

Passed out in 2022! One year was closed due to Covid, had 6 suicides of students in an academic year when STUDENTS WERE STAYING AT THEIR HOME. One a classmate! 

Just heart wrenching to see young lives go by. Administration wont do anything. 

 
We are as everyone say,"IN THE SERVICE OF THE NATION".

Curse of hijli detention camp😢

Yr iit kgp mein bhut suicide hote bhut news mein rehta ye professor shi nhi hai kya

Was placement a reason ? Or anything else any idea 👀

What happen to bro

What do you even expect from the great Indian profs

Hope you’re doing well now!

Hope you are fine now bro

Was it because of cdc or something else?

Hey just curious, what was the issue? Seen so many suicides while I was there but the reasons were never 100% clear.

they do come to light, madras is notorious for its suicides too

tf you mean by cursed? obviously the culture at kgp is responsible for this

whatever people don't understand, they start calling it curse, myth, etc etc, buddy change your thought process

Not an issue at Bombay tbh

It doesn't happen in just KGP but in all old IITs

Not really, it happens in many different colleges.

MHMS?

??

Pls explain??

He passed away after attempting suicide yesterday 😢....he lived in the block right opposite to mine too

Not is.. was notorious. They fixed their issues

What type of culture can you pls tell??

cursed with bad culture. stop raging at everything lol

yeah man 22 batch

Sad bro.

Bro did he had any backlog?

What did they do?

It's always 'lol' or 'stop raging' when someone calls out the rot directly. You're an alum, maybe instead of dismissing valid criticism as 'rage', reflect on why so many feel this way about the culture you left behind.

25 batch here...Maybe I know you... don't wanna be doxxed of course..my brother was in your batch.

They removed the ceiling fans from hostel /s

possible, but i joined in 2020 and so mostly classes were online and never had a good opportunity to communicate with the batchmates, but this is sad

Title: REDDIT BANNED!!!

Adminstration has banned reddit on college wifi, which is the only platform where people can anonymously express their views. This only shows how they are afraid of freedom of speech and free will. This has always been the case where people in power supress those who are not, to get what they want and does not take accountability for their actions.

Welcome to 1984, kgp version

Kya chutya college hai bhai fir. IIT Bombay mai to porn bhi unblocked hai. Wo bhi unblocked hai jise jio/airtel ne block kr rakha tha 😂

From the day I joined IIT kgp, this insti has let me down in every aspect while comparing it to the ones which I chose kgp over. (ex. IIT Hyderabad)
Be it be suicides, management, professors and their environment, now this. 
Like how tf do they people even call it a world class institute and eat all the govt money for doing shit

DC++ nahi chalta kya aaj kal?

dc++ ftw

Kaun kar raha apni free speech ka istemal kgp se reddit par ?

DUDE IKRR I WAS SO FUCKING MAD I COULDN'T USE IT FOR A WHOLE DAY LIKE WHY THEY GOTTA BLOCK ALL THE GOOD THINGS WE HAVE TO SURVIVE THROUGH THIS PHASE OMG

Use Orbot to make anonymous connection, its kind of free vpn you can say and it's open source.
I am using it, we can choose also which should pass network through vpn and which should not.
It's official website:
You can find its GitHub repo also if you are devloper.
Also there multiple tools intigrated in it that also take care of deep packet inspection by campus network so nobody can stop it.
It is not available in India on playstore or app store because government ask them for logging and they don't do for users privacy so government didn't allow them on stores.

If you are devloper it can also be a project to work maybe according to your interest.

If you wanna download direct apk then try this:
You connection method as "smart connect or snowflake"
And that's it you can use anything on campus networks except video games.

4 chan use karlo

tbh, everything works on LAN. Just by an RJ-45 cable and experience the freedom of... Indian internet(where the government blocks TikTok and Pornhub and enforces their own purity on a nation of 1.5 billion people) lol

Use VPN , EVen in my college/ hostel also banned reddit, although am using it through vpn🤧🙂‍↕️

lan pe yaha bhi chalta 😂

Hadh chutiya college hai actually.

U mean cornhub?

Nahi, chalta hai but use nahi karte

To bhai galti tumhari hai. DC bhi anonymous hai. Reddit ke pehle se tha, aj bhi hai. 

IIT wale ghanta kuch na kar paye DC++ ke bare me.

Dc++ is not worth it, sirf file sharing and anon chats ke lie mai dc++ setup karu isse accha reddit hai

But ok

its not that difficult honestly

DC used to be primary thing back then for all resources. And chatting were in-person. Only anonymous thing was the confession page. Put it back up!

Its not about difficulty, dc++ is dead now, alternatives are way better

Chromebooks me nahi hoti, I tried

I mean it's still amazing if everyone collectively decides to use it, 
decentralised, anonymous, fast what else ya need

Title: Something is cooking

Students hi chutiya hai Hall Tempo ke naam pe kuch bhi kar dete hai (especially to second years)

L*nd bsdk kuch hoga. Ye professor, randi ke saale inka accent samajh aata nahi. Padhayenge ye jhaant bhar assignment denge MIT wala. Bsdk kuch padha toh do phir assignment do toh theek lagta hai par nahi. Aur attendance inn bhadwo ko chahiye 80%, din bhar labour cycle bhaanjo 5-6km, phir upar se G*ndu pressure din raat ye project wo launda ye lahsun yahi karo aur ek din mar jaao Tatti sa khaana khaake, yahi hai jindagi. Aur yahaan ka weather bhi lund hai intense garmi phir barish phir garmi phir barish. Jh**nt ka IIT hai ye. Aise hee sabhi hai Koi nayi baat nahi hai. India ka best technical institute l*nd mera.

Why is the administration trying to do everything other than invest in mental health resources? 
 
Do students have any other job besides forming a task force? Already, there are numerous societies, GC events, and academics to worry about now. Jobs are hard to get, now this? The entire campus mothers' thing is delegating work to women on campus, and the task force is delegating it to students. Could you give this job to the people who are capable of doing it?

Hire a large number of young psychologists and mental health professionals across the spectrum of issues encountered by students. Also, ensure that these new hires are aware of the reality on campus so that they can provide informed advice. Offer choices to students who need help, and they will take advantage of them. People with regressive mentality in the counseling center saying "Acads pe dhyan do" and "everything will be okay" will not work.

Inko prevent hi karna hai, kyu bacche kar rahe hai usse kuch lena dena nahi.

And ye last year se hi hai, wingrep ke name se

This is a welcome step. Along with this, please consider appointing mental health experts for each hall for the next couple of months. Once students begin to realize the importance of mental health, they will start approaching the central authorities on their own. You could also build a small application for wing representatives to regularly update and inform the authorities. The wing rep should check in with their wingmates on a regular basis initially weeklly basis and if any behavioral changes are observed in a wingmates, it should be immediately uploaded into the system. This will save time and enable faster action.

There are many things a wing rep can monitor and report through the app to help in the early identification of concerns. The application can include a feature such as an LLM-based model that allows students to have initial discussions, with the option for an expert to intervene if needed. (This could even evolve into a startup idea by offering the app to other colleges. Abhi ke liye excel based system banaya ja sakta hai , Many can question wing rep ke pas sala aur koi kaam nahi hai , bhai aesa hai this POR is better than other dummy POR, here u r actually playing with data , understanding emotional /behavioural data and intelligence ...all will help u in long run ....akale institute kuch nahi kar paayega ....

Isn't this a old news? Cuz I have been wing rep last year and did nothing literally except cake khareedna...none of our seniors bothered to assign tasks lol I somehow feel they forgot our existence 😴

This was discussed in the previous meeting and the summary was
Anything involving students or profs can be manipulated to give desired results

Hire therapists, do campaigns and spread mental health awareness ❌️

Hire Campus Mommies and form random groups, random for show bakchodi ✅️

Just show off, it will continue for a few months until everyone forgets and then the cycle repeats, not that I want one to begin with

Happens every goddamn year tbh, meanwhile dugc maa chuda rahi hogi apni

Firse AP laoo problem will be automatically solved...

What’s the ‘recent happening’?

AP hatao, saare interactions ko ragging bolke DC beitaao, society Aur hall events ko gaali do, phir ye sab hone ke baad ro, smh.

Yeah this is probably not why a majority of suicides are happening. 

Shit rules, shitty professors, shit academic standards, and sky-high expectations is the killer in any Indian educational institutions let alone KGP.

Hi may I know your branch?

What's up with the deal with societies? Why is that a big thing? Im not from kgp but people make it sound like its a make or break ur career kind of thing? Just trying to know. Sounds to me just like any other college club which no recruiter gives a fuck about on ur resume? Enlighten me please.

Wingrep khud hi makhate hein, lmao

How would you solve this problem?

I was wing rep too last year, literally did nothing except forward messages from hall council group to my wing group. The best I did was inviting my wing members to welfare session hosted at Shastriya Sadan that's it, there too no one came from my side.

AP ka kya matlab hai bhai ?

Yes brother I am from a tier 3 private college , our guide and professors sucked our blood for minor and major projects .

A position of responsibility in a society is helpful for resume. Some of them in SF, KTJ, etc., significantly highlight your management skills and are useful for getting shortlisted in interviews in consultancy companies. All societies do not have the same weightage in your resume but they highlight that you did something other than academics during your time at KGP and thus helpful for companies that are not strictly academics related.

Nah they are not of much importance, especially for tech roles. But you do get to make like minded friends

yeah well that's the problem with extracurriculars at KGP. nobody takes it like a college club. instead they want to "corporatise" it. they'll call you at 3am in a closed room to decide whether to promote you, make you feel like shit. and then when you finally break, they'll tell you "corporate me aisa hi hota hai". like my brother in christ, this is a college club and you're just a nobody at this college club trying to be somebody 😂

Kuch nahi hai bhai, bas por ka jhol hai. Hagke dhone ka ek por tum taiyar kardo, dekho Sablog tut padhege. And frankly speaking, most por cv me useless hi hote hai, better would be to take atleast those pors which will help someone embezzle money.

I would recruit people who are meant for dealing with this, psychologists etc. Various panels consisting of psychologists, teachers and students would put their valuable inputs to atleast make academic reforms. Similarly hall culture reforms are needed. Instead the authority take it in their own hand and start bullshit campaigns, which ultimately is just a face of damage control, not actual progression.

This task force shit is useless. Ofcourse if I'm suicidal, I won't let some outsiders know that I'm gonna commit the deed. Even roommates don't get the clues, how could an outsider?

HR interview vibes fr 😂😂

We had a meeting with so called counsellors(professors tbh) right after the April suc*** and barely 5 people attended

Juniors will interact with the seniors, most importantly they will unite with their batchmates for back batching of their seniors, interaction will be improved

Agree with your points. 

I think the identification of people prone to depression is much bigger and needs most focus on

And how would you ensure people come to these psychologists? 
Where would you find such psychologists to come in a place like kgp?

It is very tough indeed.

People won't come to the psychologists. Psychologists, along with select teachers and students would make a panel to ensure a new and stressfree academic curriculum. Similar panels with students and HMC has to be created to ensure similar hall environment. These psychologists are only to be recruited for this project, they won't be counselling.

================================================================================

Title: Vinayak Lohani, an alumnus of IIT Kharagpur has been announced to be the receipt of Padma Shree this year for his contribution in social service. Sharing an article on him below.

Vinayak Lohani. Does India know about him? Does the name sound familiar? If the answer is yes, it’s nice. But if it’s no, then the Indian society should indulge in some serious introspection.

Bhopal (MP)-born Lohani had set foot on Bengal soil as a student to study at IIT Kharagpur and then IIM Kolkata. Course completed; but unlike his peers, this ‘fool’ didn’t strive for a glamorous, lucrative top corporate career in India or abroad to earn a fortune and live life king size. Despite being in the mid-40s, he hasn’t engaged himself in a matrimonial bond as well; yet this man is father to thousands of children.

Is it a fable or merely a dream? No, it is a hard fact which is stranger than fiction.

As stated previously, Lohani refrained from engaging in a rat race to turn successful career-wise. Instead, this Vivekananda-Mother Teresa inspired person, taking diksha at the Ramkrishna Mission, opted out of career placement after completing his MBA and, as a true human being, he turned his attention towards the plight of the orphan and poor children loitering at railway platforms and red-light areas, left to their own wretched mercy by the state and all apparatus of society.

By giving tuitions and lectures to MBA aspirants, Lohani rented a tiny accommodation, established his own organisation, Parivaar, in 2003, and took up the responsibility of sheltering feeding and educating three helpless children. But expenditure was far exceeding the income through tuitions. But drawing inspiration from his selfless Himalayan task, IIM alumni and like-minded, compassionate acquaintances came up with donations which have enabled Lohani to come up with an independent building, comprising a school and a hostel spread over more than 20 acres and housing more than 1,000 orphans or children of the poorest of the poor families. Many of them have completed their graduation and are retained in the hostel itself, giving tuitions to the younger batches and can move out only when they get ready to face the world independently.

What an act of protective father to thousands who were doomed to lead the whole of their lives as beggars or, at best, manual labourers, or could have been victims of traffickers and ended up as petty criminals or prostitutes.

It is high time India learned to identify its true heroes and role models and offered a helping hand to these faceless Vinayak Lohanis, so that they can pursue their goals with more success. The authorities concerned should also learn from Lohani about their foremost duties and priorities and at first take up the cause of India’s vulnerable children, instead of remaining immersed in playing to the gallery of statues film festivals, bullet trains, temple, or religion.

I wish such alumni were glorified more to the general public.

and all the narayanmurthys and premjis cldnt even do one tenth of this inspite of 'donating' crores of rupees

Feeling proud and motivated

Yes these news should be highlighted as so many people are barely surviving in India ,they are fighting and working hard just for their survival and people discuss about nonsense nowadays. Everyone should understand the need to help others and give back to society as much as they can

IAS 's son opening an NGO so that people can make 'donations'. Yep. Not suspicious at all. It's not like donating gives you a tax write off or anything right? Y'all are so gullible lmaoooo eating this shit right up

I reached out to this gentleman in my 5th year as I wanted to volunteer for it. The man got upset that I didn't call him sir and used his first name instead. I didn't bother to communicate with him further.

I have a feeling that OP is the same guy pulling an Elon Musk on us.

Please refrain from making such stupid assumptions without any knowledge about the subject on which you are speaking. He could have made a lot more money and led a luxurious life, given his academic qualifications and privileged background. He is not even married, neither does he have any siblings or family apart from his old father who is spending his retirement solitary in a village in Uttrakhand (where he is originally from).

Too bad!! In his defence, he is an Indian guy in his late 40s. They might consider it disrespectful when a young person addresses them directly by their names without the honorifics. Having said that he should have behaved better given his reputation.

Sharing a note from his IIM Calcutta junior I found on LinkedIn. "You know, Vinayak Lohani who just got a Padma Shri was a year's senior at B-School!!' That's how excitedly many of us are spreading the news on and off social media today. Just that Vinayak wasn't a senior by just a year. He was, and remains, ahead of most of us by many a mile. Ahead in his lofty vision, ahead in his relentless energy in bringing that vision to life and ahead in his steadfast commitment to stay true to the course, come what may! Over the past two decades, all lesser mortals like us have cheered every feather in his cap. Some with boisterous applause in auditoriums and some with proudly silent smiles. So no wonder that this latest addition of Padma Shri makes us super proud of a larger-than-life human being with whom we had the privilege of crossing paths! As for Vinayak, when a journalist recently asked him about his perspectives on recognition, this is what he had to say: "While it’s a common belief that awards or recognition can be beneficial, they don’t significantly impact an organization’s success. If an organization is fulfilling its promises to its stakeholders, donors, and beneficiaries, then external recognition doesn’t matter ... Success shouldn’t be based on recognition or validation from others. This mindset is prevalent in our aspirational social classes, which place a premium on success based on recognition. This attitude needs to be guarded against, especially in our sector." So one can easily imagine 'our' Vinayak Lohani making one more trip to the Rashtrapati Bhavan to accept one more award with his characteristically humble smile and then immersing himself back in that awe-inspiring journey of taking Parivaar to even greater heights. For the rest of us, it's an extra special Republic Day to celebrate our hearts out!"

When I was in KGP, cheating was not the norm, and if done, it was discreet.

Whatever it might be, what is this question 🥹

this isn’t even the KGP paper must be Kanpur’s. They let people take the test from their rooms for IDFC. Who tf posts themselves cheating?? Her roll number isn’t even in the room allocation list. It’s obviously just a random pic she found. bffr

Lekin 21ME31015 room allocation idfc bank ke short list me nhi h🙂🧐

This screen sharing is from hirepro platform and all students are required to share their full screen for proctoring.

The thing i find funny is even after cheating being rampant in this institute, it still has worse placements compared to other old iits😭, not saying cheating vaha nahi hoti but yaar yaha to bahaut jayada hi lag rahi ha, is subreddit ki halat dekh kar

Wtf......iss saal jada hi cheating ho rhi placements mai as compared to other years afik

I get to know that in Kanpur, IDFC allowed them to take test from room... Apne me loda nalanda jana padh geya

Lol what's this

for what role was IDFC hiring?

Bro it’s js testing your grammar these kinda questions don’t even need to be real but they like to make it hard for you by making you think that this is some current affairs Hollywood hard question whereas it’s js simple ( not the simple ) English grammar question about parts of sentences ya

Is it even the from test or just a PYQ question? Also, could you guys stop using the R word insult? Nothing warrants that. She is a sweet girl, a bit crazy but not crazy enough to post this fuckery. She probably uploaded some pyq as a joke cause the question wording is funny.
No one is stupid enough to post themselves cheat in Goddam placements.

Kuch nahi hoga it's all your wishfull thinking, people will always try to find loopholes it is the responsibility of admin to make it impossible to cheat

Kuch nahi hoga, mostly to is company ke liye ban hogi

No, this Kgp IDFC paper, . Exact same question was there in my oa set

Nahh she is kgpian

bro, atleast dont use these words on her. She didn't do anything bad to you. Did she? Referring someone with such words is not at all tolerable, have some manners

Lmao 😂

[deleted]

Open the full picture its shared on insta by this person

Placements are worse BECAUSE cheating is rampant.

Companies plan to shortlist a fixed number of people for the interviews basis test results and other criteria. 
If those shortlisted have made it to the list by unethical means, their chances of further selection are obviously lower than someone who made it by themselves.

Furthermore, once companies realise that rampant cheating is happening, they will avoid the institute - happened once in my company which was planning to visit KGP - it was only alumnus like me pleaded did they continue with their plans.

No

Kya aap thode se bkl hai??

There is something called mobile phone??

are u slow? that's an oa screen grab from her room all placement tests are mandated to be taken from nalanda

Are you blind or something? Can you not see the camera is on??

Pehle koi pakda jaata aise to debar ho jaata placements se.

bro, question repeats in OA's, Google OA is the best example of it, and it's true people are giving OA's, but I don't think anyone will brag about it and put it on social media

It is the case actually. The name is identifiable at top corner if you have heard the person's name before.

I accept that this is a bad part from the Mess side, but I *also* want these holy shitty guys posting this crap to be banned from the IIT KGP community. When you live in a college, it’s your home. When you live with your family, that’s your home. When you live in a bachelor flat or a PG, that’s your home too. And you idiots should at least have the basic sense that you’re dragging an inside-house issue out into the whole damn world. It’s like going around announcing that your wife can’t cook, hoping public embarrassment will magically fix things while completely forgetting that you’re just trashing your own family’s privacy.

All because you don’t have the guts to face people directly or deal with the problem like actual humans. You bullshit people will never change until you understand the scale and responsibility of using social media, instead of vomiting every internal issue onto the internet like attention-starved clowns.

Who cares vpn zondabad

students have mass-mailed to the diro, let's wait and see

Most edible too

I am regretting since my first sem.

True. I also felt same in my stay in kgp

done, a good load of students have shared mails with the same template

Cc matlab?

You still wanna eat or what

there's been a mass complaint to diro, hopefully something comes out of it

jo bhi hai, hum dahi samajh ke khate hai usey

Really? Did you see them?

please use your user flair, mess wale dada

Asli ID se Aoo..

Bhai tu wahi hai na jo Nalanda ke khet mein ser ke bal gira tha?

MMM mess Bishal chala rahi kya?

Did something happen? Since incidents like this are not new and occur in every hall, it depends on the administration and HCM to determine the severity of the action...If not pressured, the admin might impose a small fine...and nothing major happens, which can itself lead to this blunder repeating again.

Abhi paida hue ho kya?

Kha liya (gareebi😔) 

Has someone mailed about this to the director or the warden?

🥺

Yup. These guys are so farzi that I saw them standing amonitiring ppl outside warden office

Dada I know who is this. Use a burnol. I have seen them doing they planned well though from lower floor to next floor coming at various time

nah, it has changed this year. it was bishal last year, kumar now

I have messaged you, please check your inbox.

Title: Civic sense🥀

would u wear them again if they were your clothes??

Wtf, what's the context?

Wtf. Kaise ajeeb se janwar hai. PhD isko kaise mil gaya.

This is Ms Hall W3 block, there was an incident where a PhD scholar had explicitly told students from other blocks not to use the washing machine assigned to W3 residents. Despite the instruction, some students from other blocks continued to use it. In response, the scholar allegedly removed their clothes from the machine and dumped them into the commode.

I would have humiliated him and most probably won't control my calm, na uske baap ki washing machine hai aur na uske baap ke kapde

Iss bsdiwaale ko chhodiyo nahi bhai…. director ko yeh video mail karde… nahi koi response aaye toh main building mein director ka office hai… waha jaake dikha diyo.. thora randi rona… lekjn bhai uss bsdwaale ki maiya chod diyo.. hum sab btech wale tere sath hai

Uske room ke saamne hag do aur bahar se lock kar do

Mention who did it. Shame him

File a ragging case and what not against them. Mass mail till they are not removed from the campus . As a final resort you know what to do...

What is going on in Kgp? Such a downfall.

This is just so pathetic. IITians bothered with such low class people. 

When I was living in LBS hall when someone didn't flush I used to feel like I was among uneducated people but couldn't do anything about it.
Thank God later on I got mmm hall and there we had personal washrooms.

Phd scholar guy did so bad abb unke kalde bi daldoo aisse washroom mein...complaint file krdo uss uncle par...uncle is tooo dumb😭😭

Which hall is this?

Must be the wind

Has he been identified?

Most of the phd people here are di©kheads, they're dumb as fuck and think they're great

Ragging ka case daalo

Put a lot of oil on Each cloth.

Dude i have contamination ocd. This is the reason why i always stand near washing machine when i wash my cloths. If this happened to me, i would probably wash them 4-5 times with high dose of liquid detergent.

Kalesh kyon nhi hua?

Iss mc ko pelo jaake room mai, this level of work can't imagine, throwing someone else's clothes in urinal pots

Areee this has happened today. All the clothes are of the W3 Block residents only.

Aur mein sochta tha ms hall mein PhD wale h woh toh zyada mature honge 🫡

Bhai kaam to pitne wala kra hai is phd wale ne.iske baap ki machine h kya

Apparently this is quite a norm in few blocks of BRH as well. An alum told me he was visiting KGP for a month as research scholar and was given a room in BRH. He being used to UG halls way, kept his bucket near the machine and went away for a long time. When he came back, his clothes were all in the toilet. Seems something wrong with the PhDs here in KGP.

Iss bhen ke lode phd waalo ko nikalo, failures hai saale sab

What's the name of that PhD scholar? Did you see that guy doing it?

How's he eligible for PhD in iit?

As a representative from NITJ.. I second this.

But this is serious issue, why someone has to throw clothes in the toilet, pathetic.

I wonder if the same thing would happen if someone left the machine unattended while their clothes were being washed.

Title: Selling Yamaha f280 guitar

Actual price 8.2k(including bag, extra strings and clips) selling at 6k. Used less than 10times, around 2 months old.

That's a weird looking bike you've got there.

Best I can do is three fiddy

How to contact you ?

Don't give up. Learn how to play guitar.

I play on this guitar check my posts..

Dm

tf? 3k is enough for this 

i've been using it for more than an year now.

Hey is this still available??

Nahh ... I will buy a new one with a bit extra for that price.. 
Btw I have no space for another anyways... Already my existing 4 are struggling

Yamaha f280? Mileage kya deti hai?

I want to start learning guitar, I have no idea about which guitar to buy and from where to learn, any suggestions? Is buying guitar online safe?

What's the horse power?

If you're in lko, lemme know I'd like to buy that.

Man why are you selling it

150 rupaya dega...

150 rupiya dega

1000 dunga

Ask if it can do wheelie

Dm

Nah bro, I've got another guitar

Flex nusta flex

60 dB

Playing since 2015 i d suggest buy the f310 or f280 , but offline

2db

which one?

Which one, any course you recommend

🙂

Any other guidelines you would like to add on buying guitars?

0-100 in how many seconds?

Acoustic pahadi YouTube good for beginners.

Watch a video my guy on YouTube, there are many, it's too many things for anybody to list here.

Its best if you play on a borrowed guitar for a while and then plan on investing 10k+ , many classes in india provide guitars for beginners. If you're anyway gonna buy it then take someones help (a friend whos a 🎸 ist) and yeah watch yt videos do your research. Also dont buy a colour which ull regret later on😁i made that mistake and lived with it untill i became really good and then after 4-5yrs i bought another one. Also look for what shape are you looking for dreadnought/ cutaway(idk the name). Umm then look for action(height between the frets and strings)

4 bars of 4/4

Mileage?

Title: Just saved...

I am from LBS hall.
This fan fell at 2-3 am while we were sleeping. It was on full speed. My roommate just saved because he was sleeping close to wall. If he was at side of bed then this might have been dameged his feet. And if he was sleeping upside down then it would have fallen straight on his head. Imagine fan spinning with full speed falling on your body☠️. How scary it is😭. This fan is so old and dameged. Why don't they install new fans?

Didn't it show any symptoms before?

KGP admin ka fan hatane ka tareeka thoda kezual hai

Bhai that’s crazy report this to the warden

Didn't they keep any safety wire recently? So lucky

maine pehle din hi socha tha ki ye toh hoga, aaj dekhliya 🥲🥲

Title: Another suicide after exactly 1 year, what's happening in KGP?

Last year also faizan was found dead around 2nd week of October. I don't know how many will I witness such things😥 by the end of my graduation.
To all of my fellow kgpians just BE BRAVE no matter how tough it becomes.

This place can be an insensitive shithole at times. Literally everything is running as per schedule, some student club's holding selections today, classes are on, student society activities haven't ceased.... I can't believe the degree of normalcy around.

Profs from the Electrical department are trashy assholes who do not think of you as a human.

It's not about what's happening in KGP; it's more like what has been happening in KGP. During my 5-year stay from 2013-2018, the campus experienced around 12-13 suicides, which is crazy. There was a Q&A session demanded by the students and the director, during that time, Partha Pratim Chakraborty agreed to it, and we had it in TOAT. The questions from the students were so brutal, and the students were so aggressive that PPC cried openly that day. However, nothing improved in terms of why so many suicides happen on the campus.

What happened this time?

Isnt Faizan's death being investigated as a murder? Something about piercing his chest i think.

what will happen now? 
are they gonna suppress it?

I heard that he survived.
It was an attempt

Post it on r/India to get more eyeballs

Kinda weird to know even these fuckery exists in India.

I'm a Tier 3 college graduate (24M), worked for 2 years, now have a startup that currently makes $4-5k/month, which is way more than what most Iitians get in the beginning of there career. Will scale it to $200k/month completely bootstrapping it in the next couple of years. Currently living a lavish life with my parents and extended family in daman.

I dreamt of joining Civil Services, college ruined the dream by rusticating me for 6 months due to low attendance. Made sure to set an example that they will never have in ages.

1st completed my degree (took me 5 years), opted out of placements, and bagged a 7 lpa+30k bonus job at a product based firm and astonished the shit out of them.

Now, on a journey of creating the best startup in my hometown, and now the college calls me to give talks at there place :)

Guys, everything's super fine. Just hold onto your life. You never know when would the right thing click for you. I'm living a life I once dreamt of. Everyday is a bliss for me. I work 14 hours, not because I have to, but because i love to. Cause I have found my thing.

Stick to it guys and gals. Life is a beautiful beautiful thing to exist into. That too becoming a homosapien, is so so cool.

Bahut cheeze hai karne ko. Achee se raho sab. Zyada faltu tension to liya hi mat karo. IIT pahuch gae yaar....Maa baap ko vahi dikhao apne bare me jo ho tum. Kabhi jhuut nhi... Sach bolo.

Classes should be cancelled today and a moment of silence should be held!
We are having classes and Seminars today like nothing happened. Please bring to this to the management's notice and please cancel the Seminars and class today. Instead talk about mental health.

हलकी फुल्की सी है ज़िन्दगी बोझ तोह ख्वाहिशों का है

There are many reasons behind such incidents. The larger student community is also insensitive to mental health concerns. They will come out to celebrate fests every other month but I have never seen organized outrage from the Kgp community. I still remember how the whole campus came out to protest when offline exams were to be held 2 years ago but have never seen even 10% of the crowd mourn the deaths of fellow students who were forced through hell. Why can't the student community fight for better facilities to deal with mental health concerns? We should observe the death anniversaries of our friends and call for change, confront those in power

[deleted]

At times there is no escap, everyone is going through a battle in his/her mind.

Nothing good

I'm not in any of these colleges 
but this is just sad 
Students have been brainwashed into thinking that this 
Is their everything or else they have no option 

I understand people have ambitions 
but don't do this shit man .
Who cares if we fail 
Or some incident happens 

Live with pain and end it psychologically 
It's okay because that pain is an illusion brought about by our own conditioning .

Awaken yourself students 
This is the real education 
Not that " if you fail there's no way out "

Suicide

What is it with kgp and suicides i swear there is something wrong about the admin there in Roorkee there haven’t been any suicides for the past 5-6 years…

This is nothing new. Since 2016, there has been atleast one case of suicide from KGP in every year.

2017 was a disastrous year, with 4 suicides happening one each from Jan-Apr.

Our current director was HOD of your civil dept and when one student committed suicide in campus he was telling the father how these things are normal in iits and was giving him stats of different iits.

[deleted]

Demon Chatterjee

How different are they from other dept profs?

Same story, iit hyderabad

Do you mean literally every prof in kgp ?

Same story IIT Jammu 😭

Sad to say, I was part of that crowd, but we failed to achieve anything substantial

5th year electrical student tried to attempt suicide in LBS hall at around 1030 pm ,that's what I heard...
Edit-4th year, and he passed away this morning... rip Kiran

It WAS a murder, everything here knows that. He had bruises all over and meat preservative chemicals were found in that room.

Like every other institution attempting to wipe off it's tarnished image? Yes! Ofc.

No bro its official now

Yeah it was an attempt but after going to B C roy it's confirmed that he has been dead

No 😔

Nobody cares. Why are you bragging here exactly?

That battle is an illusion bro 
brought by your own conditioning 

It's okay if you fail
Who gives a shit
Parents won't care about you ??
So what man 
because the parents are themselves brainwashed

Wtf, the audacity

Someone is dead and it is normal? Are you serious

Nn ni nn ñ nn bnmm BBC cvg bn. Vvvvccvcfvvv v m . M nm. Nnnn. NNnn nnN

Subduing is one thing, straight-up not acknowledging a death is another. There's been no official statement from the admin, not even a 'two minutes of silence' kinda mail. 

Is this the KGP normal, to not care until you're the person that hangs?

Yup how??

in tier 1 college,nothing can top the demon of md tiwari when he worked director of IIITA.At least any college can protest , in IIITA nobody got the courage to protest

I have heard he is a 4th year guy 

And apparently he has died (thats what people around me are saying)

Why would 5th year commit suicide. He has almost finished graduation. Anything regarding placements?

Wait? For real?! Any possible motives?

did you see the bruises? or did you hear someone say he had bruises? and what meat preservative was in his room? how much? what was it used for?

I guess this comment says that atleast someone cared :)

Keeping it aside, it's just your perspective that I'm bragging. For me, it's writing to those folks who ends up questioning themselves that if a useless guy like me can do something with my life, without giving any fucks to what has happened and what happens, then why can't they do it.

And what if somebody cares? Doesn't makes any difference. I still have to wake up and get my stuff done on my own. Those who care aren't getting it done for me. 

The moment you stop caring about whether someone cares for you or not, will be the moment people around you start caring a lot. Give it a try!

Sometimes its hard to get over. I am not justifying anything but when things become worse and no one to share and support what you are going through then it's hard to get over and rise again.

Yeah... As a fresher this is disappointing. 
I am from the same hall and can't believe what is happening.. Nobody even cares and all are just spreading rumors.

[deleted]

Ek dost hai waha pe puchna padhega usse kya scene hai..but wo toh kehta hai abhi toh theek hi hai. Maybe past m chudaap kiya hoga

Probably love. Most suicides at that age are related to love.

Disagree

yes past ka hi hai.He got the directorship only becasue of connection with politicians,Imagine not building a hostel for first years just to pay rent to his friend property which no body will rent in a differnt city.

Students of KGP have bigger problem than love. I have heard its about BTP pressure from Prof..

Not an engineer or from KGP, but I think any student in a top-ranked institution would disagree with this. Sure the opposite sex can cause a lot of drama and pain. But it is absolutely nothing in comparison to the stress and pain of placements, entrance exams, admissions abroad etc. for a final year student. When you're disappointed in love, at least you objectively know the world isn't actually ending, it just feels that way. With career and education-related stuff, there'a a genuine possibility that your entire life could be ruined by what happens in a few weeks. Plus there's the parental expectation: no mother will be disappointed that her child's college romance did not last!

It's k. Bollywood will cast his story. Immortality in love bruh

Bro humara yaha chutiya director bhadva hostel banaya hi nahi 1sr year wala ka kehra hai November Tak ban jayega hostel wo bhi shayad. Aur tab tak aap log seniors ke hostel mein raho aur mtech wale seniors ko bol diya aap Gand marao aapko hostel nahi milega aap city mein rent dhundh lo aapko 10k de deta hu.

less likely to be BTP pressure

I guess they are normal human beings too who are capable of feeling emotions and intend to start a family someday? 😂

>Plus there's the parental expectation

Parental expectations usually play a role in the 12th class suicides, before/after exam results. Once the kid is in a big college parents are usually proud already and getting/not getting placements is not a suicide level issue.

>it is absolutely nothing in comparison to the stress and pain of placements, entrance exams, admissions abroad etc. for a final year student.

Stress - yes. Suicide level stress - no. Students from IITs will get placed no matter what. They might be disappointed with where they end up.

>When you're disappointed in love, at least you objectively know the world isn't actually ending

Tells us you actually haven't faced a love failure. The whole world and everything seems completely pointless if you can't be with that person. And if the guy has no friends to hold him up, (and families usually come to know too late anyway), it can lead to suicide. Loneliness leads to a death spiral. Have myself had to support a couple of friends who did crazy stuff like starving for a week when their love lives crashed.

What's wrong with you buddy

Lmao I lost it at "not getting placement is not a suicide level issue" , dude have u ever tried engineering? Bcoz not getting placement is the worst thing that could happen to any final year student in an IIT, which can very EASILY lead to suicide. Lmao do you even know what placement is fr? Smh fr

"Bigger problems than love". Everything that is wrong, summed up in one phrase.

>Lmao I lost it at "not getting placement is not a suicide level issue"

So you actually created a statement I did not write and put it in quotes?

>dude have u ever tried engineering?

Ofcourse, and have gone through the whole hog. 

>Bcoz not getting placement is the worst thing that could happen to any final year student in an IIT, which can very EASILY lead to suicide.

Don't make generic stuff up. Show me an actual case to back it up. Nobody kills themselves because they didn't get placed. Anyway at IITs it almost never happens that someone isn't placed (from [B.Tech]( they might get placed with low package but that is about it.

Lmao so you are saying that you wrote the whole comment except the third line which clearly says "not getting placements is not a suicide level issue", its clearly visible that you wrote it by yourself, don't make a fool out of yourself now lmao. once try engineering you will realize what real stress of not getting placed is, keyboard warrior 15yo tryna act cool in sub xd fr

>so you are saying that you wrote the whole comment except the third line

ah.. i missed that. I did say it, it was above the relevant comment instead of below, so missed it looks like.

>Once try engineering you will realize what real stress of not getting placed is, keyboard warrior 15yo tryna act cool in sub xd fr

Dude. Looks like you are doing a lot of second-hand reporting. I really doubt you know E of engineering. Everyone who has "actually" done engineering knows it is one of the easier professions. We just like to whine about it a lot. We have all seen what the medical guys go through and we have like 10% of their stress. and most of us are into one-night batting as far as exams are concerned anyway. So, don't give gyan.

Title: We won't be seeing the aggressive white-black dog near SNVH anytime soon.

The institute has relocated a few aggressive dogs to a rehabilitation centre in Kolkata. Despite all the extreme comments about ki**ing dogs and similar suggestions, what actually made a difference was consistently filing complaints with the authorities over the past few months. So, while the IIT administration may not always function perfectly, raising issues through proper channels can sometimes bring results.

This is huge. I hated that beast.

Now I don't have to avoid that route anymore

When a dog is more well known than people! I ain't even in KGP, and know about a black one who hounds around MMM? Something like that.

Anyhow, good job guys. The ones we have in Delhi are quite harmless, but chonky af.

YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

take every fuc**** stray dog out of this campus

Bro I used to take the entire pepsi cut then main building road to snig (after meeting frnd at snvh)instead of just straight road through mt because of that mf
This is huge😭😭😭😭❤️

Today morning I was shit scared seeing that enclosure empty. I thought it was roaming freely outside. God bless him 🙏

Honestly, it'd have been best if those mutts were put down....the rehab centre will do nothing and let these beasts loose in a few months, I just hope i graduate by then....

[ Removed by Reddit ]

Hope they deal with those few dogs in MMM too

Great Job, They should take every f\*\*\*k stray dog out of the city

Should've taken many from pan and near BC roy too

Struggling here in iit Hyderabad… some a* holes are feeding dogs consistently and dogs are even coming from outside the campus. You can’t eat at any open space, jumping over and scaring students , some d lovers are taking them to their pods ….. list goes on …. Authorities are blind as f*k

kill that bastard

Send all strays to Nagaland

Those dog lovers paid the van guy and took a few of the dogs back to campus in a car after the van left the campus boundaries

Crazy stuff

Yeah they’ll be let loose on the way somewhere.

Deported to China

I saw the black and white one chasing someone near the clock tower on Wednesday night.

Bro had more control over campus traffic than the guards ever did 🐕🚦

Your letter might have helped, my man!! :)

As well as those students who pet and feed them

A few at a time..... :)

More dogs are going to be removed....don't worry 👍

Now bro can meet his baddie in peace

u can think of me as a sensitive guy...but I do not support killing of animals

A dog once bit me when I was in 4th...the bite mark is still on my hand......but I still won't support killing of animals....I'm bigger than that bro u can call me a moron I respect ur pov (btw..the dog died in 4 months on its own after biting me)

Done 👍 sherkhan is gone

Give it some time bro....sabh hoga :)

Already removed a few :)

Same here as well..but believe me, the only way to actually fix it is by constantly emailing the authorities about it. The emails should not mention killing, shooting or eating the dog :3 just mention the problem you are facing and that it's affecting your wellbeing. Tell your friends to email as well....do it consistently for 2-3 months and you may get some good news. Worked for us at kgp.

Hi please check DM

No, you would find it next inside momos

fir kya hua?

Fr broo I don't understand why they feed them!!Dogs are roaming inside halls just because of them 😭😭

are you poisonous

I see, it's unfortunate that it left a scar 😢 it's precisely for reasons like these that stray dogs should be put down without exception or mercy.

Lmao

Phir wo midsems ki taiyari krne lag gaya

There was one guy at Azad during my time who used to bring 15-16 dogs from entire pan loop area to our wing and pet them and feed them. The whole wing used to be filled with dog crap

idk...maybe u should try biting me....if u end up like that dog we would definitely know

kutta?

Then I threatened to murder him and he stopped but his another chutiya friend started this habit. Both were from physics department. That chutiya friend was also rich guy with ST who just played computer games 24x7 and unbothered about studies. And fuck all the political correctness people for trying to cancel me for spitting facts

Fellow alumnus of this insti. I was there between 2007 and 2012. Still miss the campus every day. Nothing like it.

Thoda kgp k road ko bhi beautiful picture me dalo

Enjoy your time at this beautiful campus.

They've deteriorated a lot in the last couple of years. I remember when I initially came to campus I was genuinely impressed by the quality of roads. With time kgp has just worsened in many ways.

Nah man, after the things I have seen at IIT, I hate that place. 

Yeah, I did gain a lot of experience in the campus, mainly because of the widespread corruption in the administration

Hahaha, nice one

Even then you have seen nothing. This one looked like a city road. 

The campus looks far better without the human garbage.

Corruption level day by day📈

What did they do wrong? Why didn’t you send them first? ye kya politics hai, chutiya politics. You people are playing dirty politics and risking students life. This is not fair at all, day by day you are making students lose hope. What kind of system is this? You are degrading the pride and respect of IIT Kharagpur—shame on you.

Only the luchcha lafangas in kgp get the job. Working hard is not key, take drug, meet Alumnus, make them happy by means they want and give your time in Gymkhana are the only way.

Exact same thing happened in swiggy
Half of the e-cell was there for connection, extented list guys were giving 2-3 interviews, waited for round 1 for 5+ hrs

Same politics happened in SWIGGY as well, I sat there for almost 12 hrs and some pc named dutta stopped the process demanding hr to give offer to one of the ex-pc… it is soo pathetic to see such pcs working for the students of iit kgp

Title: Civic Sense???

Bc Why can't they throw these in dustbins ??? Wtf is wrong with the students ig in India Civic sense is not related education .It's in people's blood .

And please guys don't walk on the cycle lane and use the footpath.(especially girls🙏)

Who the fuck drink coolberg

Even in my times (more than 10 years ago) it was same.

Civic sense doesn't exist here . My sister got infection because the guests didn't even care to lift the toilet seat to pee and peed all over seat

You don't have civic sense if you ask for civic sense in INDIA (carcasm). also visit the bathrooms, you will find tatti bombs there. They don't have time to flush. And people ask why India is not developing?

Leave, india aside.. being a fresher.. i thought there are intellectual ppl here, it would be different...but no!! Same hostel corruption, lack of basic civic sense like ppl throw garbage out of their window wtf!!

This is India. Civic sense is a foreign concept here.

Le Kgp junta: What’s that?

Civic sense?nuh uh. Almost in every hall you can find sandal marks on the toilet seats, so yeah that answers it pretty much.

Don't forget the full road blocking horizontal lines

Also don't ride Cycles in the main road, ride cycles in the cycle track

Title: What to do now ?.

there’s always a mamma’s boy doing this

Log college aane ke baad bhi yesab compare karte hai?

It was given our university would lose out in opening ranks to Hyderabad sooner or later. It is a cosmopolitan city with so many MNC's and startups, the demand for computer science is also unreal. I still believe our university to be a notch above them.

Now this is something obvious, how can you expect a university in which corruption is a morning coffee to the management can even come close to a university which has one of the best management in India. As time passes by this university’s standards would go down significantly. Come on man this place doesn’t have any transportation connectivity, not even a road transport corporation.

I can't find this anywhere (cse). Which year, program and branch??

Closing rank matters.

people selecting IIT Hyderabad for any other branch than CSE is really questionable. 

Placement schemes over the years tell the story.

Sab moh maya hai kud ke mar jao sab

I think it has less to do with Hyderabad being a cosmopolitan city with MNCs and startups, and more to do with how IITKGP is just plain ass

Mnc at IIT H also seems good. Placements and median was 38.5lpa.

I live in hyderabad and I want to do cs in future, should I look forward for jee mains and adv for iit hyderabad or tier 2 colleges like jntuh or Osmania?

Maths and computing? That's a good course ngl.

lmao the median, so damn inflated 🤡🤣

Bruh even IIIT hyderabad is nice. Also you'll get state quota for Warangal. Try those first?

But the cutoff for general category is very low bro for core branch 99.5+ is must for iiit hyd... I have state quota but scoring so much is impossible for me... I'm thinking bits or else jntuh or Osmania

What's the cutoff for Warangal

Why didn't he have any kind of medical insurance at this time...most part of the expenses could have been covered easily

To everyone reading this, buy an insurance. Its a small drain on resource but it prevents you not being able to afford surgeries in pvt where they are available quicker than gov, also itll prevent your life from imploding forcing you to make a choice between poverty and a loved ones life. Once you have money in the bank you can afford to go without insurance.

Aren't there government hospitals with surgeons and everything in every district?

Title: Fight Club at IIT KGP?

Yesterday some of my friends and I were out for a night out. We came across a very strange activity happening at the new construction building behind SBP Hall. There were around 6–7 men standing in a circle, and two of them were fighting in the middle. All of them were shirtless. It was around 2 AM, and because of the dim light, we couldn’t see their faces clearly it was mostly dark. The guys were cheering and fighting aggressively like some event is going on. They looked like students, around the usual age of KGP students.
They caught our attention, and one of them called out to us, saying “Oye, idhar aao sab… come here” Then the others also started calling us. We got really scared and quickly rode away from that place on our cycles. We tried to take a video too, but everything happened so quickly that we didn’t get enough time, and everyone was holding their cycles.
P.S.: We were not dr**k neither high.

Title: Pseudoscience and Kgp

Despite being a science and technology institute, why are there so many followers of 'gurus' like Sadhguru who propagate pseudoscience all the time? And it's not just students, even some of the professors are ready to accept all the BS? What's going wrong exactly?

I think the best way to look at it is, people aren't looking for scientific research in Sadhguru, they are mostly looking for emotional/spiritual answers, and almost any answer to it will just happen to be unscientific unless it is something that can be better explained through psychology

Don’t think India cares much for scientific thinking. The purpose of science in India is to use it for personal gains like job/Money .. also india there is widespread tribal belief ingrained in society that our ancient society had advanced scientific knowledge . Granted that some were rational like school of nyaya /advaita etc but each needs to be examined for it’s scientific and rational validity. Some old Indian guy wrote it alone doesn’t make it scientific and true .

I remember there was a rumor that mangalyan had the nimbu mirchi thread . 
I support op and share his concern in the sense these things should not be encouraged by the institute . Someone can do an event and invite sadhguru but the Insti shouldn’t be supporting it and make it official . 
But then what to talk of the Insti who published a pseudo scientific calendar .

Amritkaal ka Prasaad samajh kar ignore Karo.

"Religion without Science is Blind. Science without religion is lame"- Albert Einstein.

I prefer to use the word 'faith' for the word 'religion' in the next few sentences. 
'Faith' is not a bad thing. Faith can be very powerful in our everyday life. Faith can keep a man fighting even though he knows the war is lost. Rationality doesn't work everywhere. Miracles do happen. That's the truth. 

And successful 'gurus' rely mostly on philosophical discussions, rather than pure religious preachings.

 
If you watch one video of Sadhguru's on youtube, you could have a very tiny view out of the whole picture. Sadhguru usually talks philosophy, art of living, state of mind etc. Sometimes he gets ahead of himself and ventures into science. It is a business at the end of the day. He has successfully built a business.

 
But most things he say make sense. He preaches mindfulness, detachment, self realization etc. Some teachings even overlap with the teachings of Buddha. Maybe your peers and professors are paying heed to those philosophical discussions, which could actually be helpful.

 
So, even though its a business, as long as the consumer gets value for his money, its a success. 
You should look at the whole picture.

You’re mixing practical knowledge with very limited application in real life on a daily living basis , to something that’s for the living lifestyle and mind,body and soul.

That's human psychology. Have been existing from time immemorial.

r/scienceisdope

Answer this

All these Gurus always target kids in engineering college. Because these kids are really proud of being from a science background, with most never internalizing the scientific methodology. (The latter applies to most people, but the fake sense of being science-y makes the indoctrination easier)

It's the best audience to be baptized into believing random stuff to be "scientific", based on unrelated jargon.

**Source**: I have been part of such organizations during my college days, in a NIT. And have seen these patterns working on me and others, some more than others.

This is also an age, where you would pretty much do anything, to be part of a group. So that also helps.

It's mostly harmless, unless people go too deep into the pseudo-science part. And most people grow out of it. They are either not too involved, or get too involved, and see the stupidities and tricks behind the facade.

These are religious cults, just like religious cults of any other religion. And cults are never good for the common members.

There was a video, I think by Science is dope, that said "we are not taught how to think scientifically but rather to do just do scientific things".

And it stands true for any course in India. We lack critical and scientific thinking because we are never promoted or taught to do so.
Even in school, we are told to just remember and never understand. Hence why the presence of science and religion simultaneously in our country.

Teach science in a manner compatible with culture . Culture and religion are the main part of your identity and if something is presented as a challenge to itand people cannot falsify it , they try to ignore it . It was not so with early scholars of India . 
People to associate themselves with science . For instance , Mohan had 8 apples , he sold 5 then how many were left with him , is a dull way to teach students , try writing it ways questions were framed in the book of mathematics Leelavati , where playful imagery and a bit of poetry is used .

Dear OP

- If we talk about logics & proof, there is no proof that being bitter, childish & accusatory helps in scientific temperament. 

- Considering IIT KGP students are already bright, what requires further in becoming better at science & research is hard work & deeper subject knowledge. And this doesn’t come from minding other’s business. Don’t spend time on what others are believing & focus on your own belief. 

- There is no theory or equation to suggest that religious or spiritual person can not excel at science. And I have seen ample scientists who are religious or spiritual. But if you have any negative correlation, can you pls share us in a scientific way ? [and not in Rant ]

- Let’s not be a version of Taliban or Nazi [not referring for violence] which doesn’t accept others belief system. Everyone can excel in their own unique way.

Any subpopulation of India will show cultural characteristics of the general population. So it's not really a surprise to see students/professors at IIT kgp being like that. 

The funny part is that 

Article 51 needs you to have a scientific temper. So such professors should ideally lose jobs for violating a fundamental duty. But then the judiciary also has its fair share of fanatics 

Funnier is the sheer number of people at IITs who are Nehru haters. Think of the sheer irony of studying in an institution crafted by the man and hating on him.

Should they close the Humanities and Social Sciences department too? After all, it’s a science and technology institute.

The thing is

You're not in lane yourself

If you're saying that propagating Sanatan dharm is nothing but BS, 

You my friend aren't surely in the lane 

Tho propagating pseudoscience and other false facts is a bit shameful, propagating Sanatan dharm is not

If you'd have ever even considered reading some of our ancient texts, you'd understand they're not scientifically accurate, instead, science is our Indian textually accurate

From maths to science to human behaviour to politics to psychology to philosophy

Our religion, sanatan dharm is the truth

A very basic wrong assumption you are making. 

Can't two things be right at once? 
Can't a person excel in science and spirituality or religion at once? 

Aise laoge kya critical thinking science padhne ke liye?

All my theories are highly influenced by vedanta -erwin schodinger

There is no kind of framework within which we can find consciousness in the plural; this is simply something we construct because of the temporal plurality of individuals, but it is a false construction… The only solution to this conflict insofar as any is available to us at all lies in the ancient wisdom of the Upanishad - Erwin schodinger

After the conversations about Indian philosophy, some of the ideas of Quantum Physics that had seemed so crazy suddenly made more sense.”- Werner Heisenberg

Quantum will not look ridiculous to people who have read vedanta - Werner Heisenberg

I think you know the world of both

[deleted]

Or you are just hinduphobic

chup chutiye

This could be a possible reason (but again i might be wrong) 

Iits and engineering cllgs in general are known to not take part in any religion practices or pseudoscience. There is also a very common notion that engineers and students of science are against religion (obviously this is false) just because we refuse to take part in stupid religious practices. 

Recently there has been many suicides in iits and other engineering cllgs. This has gotten a similar response from many communities- "bhagwan ko nhi manoge to yahi hoga", "bhagwan ko nhi maane, isliye bhagwan bachane nhi aya", "dharm chorne se insaan kamjor ho jata hai", etc. I am sure you must have heard similar comments. 

Now i don't think professors preach or are in support of pseudoscience, but i think the problem is they are under severe pressure because of this suicides and specially under the political scenario in india ( i wont go into this, those who can understand, understand) they are forced to entertain some radical thinking, even if they dont believe in it. 

Maybe i am not 100% correct, but i do think there is some truth here.

Burnol moment after Samvaad Or what?

Religion or 'mata' (which means opinion or idea) has all along been driven by 'faith'. That is you propagate an opinion or idea by your faith in it. When that opinion gets too strengthened it becomes 'mada' which means intoxication.

Modern science drives ideas by challenging them and seeking evidence in some form. In both science and religion you can put forward new hypothesis or models but in science you can be challenged and have to prove it by evidence. In religion you cannot challenge and accept it as faith in a guru or messenger or some originating person.

Once upon a time gurus or messengers used logical debates to win over other's ideas. Later on it descended to 'magical cures' or 'miracles' or 'stories of miracles' by their followers to claim superiority in the person to prove superiority of their ideas. Modern gurus use business and political connections to achieve personal supremacy and transfer that supremacy to their ideas. Hence their ideas have to have 'scientific flavor'.

In fact many ideas of modern gurus are compiled by a carefully selected team, as they talk on every subject on earth to ensure that scientific flavor, though many the times they end up pedding pseudo-science for sure.

1000 years back people can challenge Adi Shankara to debates and Shankara debated mimamsakas, buddhists, jains and people of varied beliefs, without claiming superiority of person. Shankara travelled barefoot from one end to another end of the country and had no political connections. Opposition to Shankara was never depicted as opposition to dharma.

Now-a-days gurus fly across the globe, have strong political and business connections and you cannot challenge a guru's idea openly, as opposition to guru will be depicted as opposition to dharma itself and there will be a violent naming and shaming in media and social media, apart from other effects such as losing a job or business opportunity. 

In short in the past ideas gave a person supremacy in our dharma and now supermacy of a person leads to acceptance of ideas.

Religion gives hope, belief, and ways to live life, science gives empirical evidence, methodologies for understanding the world, and technologies that improve quality of life. One cannot replace the other.

Science works on evidence and proofReligion works on magic and belief

Everyone is born with different kind of brain , Some asks question for everything . Some believe things if others are believing it . 

I believe both are okay but being extreme in any case is bad .

I am not a smart person but I can think of one answer. 

Everyone at one point or other in life come to understand one thing. Life is painfull. It will definitely start breaking. you. It doesn't matter at what position you are. That is the point when people start running to god for help. It can be a beautiful women who started to lose her beauty or can be a billionaire who came to a realisation that he have to leave everything here and go. 

When people learn this. They get scared. Many get depressed. They run to god. God will never answer your prayers. Jitna rona he ro lo. Then you will go to these babas and start listening to them. Now, I am not telling everyone among them are fraud. Many are genuine people and know about spirituality and actually can help you with your problems but then there are guys like sadhguru who give vague answer for everything and nothing concrete.

Men first run after money. Once he get money he run after fame. Once he get fame, then he realises everything is useless and then run after god. So maybe troubled people are going to sadhguru for answers which they don't have which include great achievers like iit profs. Students who are suffering mentally because of some circumstances, they are going too.

I don't think it is related to religion or something. When you are get wrecked in life and you realise that no one can help you, then people run to god. 

One more observation. More than students, profs might be more in number who follows these things. Reason - When we are young, we have parents, uncle,aunt or any other elder to rely on. The person in 50-60 age grouo mostly have no one to rely on. His elders might have already died or are not capable to give any advice. So they go to babas.

Now these are just my views. You can ignore them if you think whatever I wrote is bs. The question just randomly popped in my feed. I am not even from iit. I am from an average college.

Sadhguru talks about Spirituality and that is quite important for a human being as much as it is to develop scientific thinking. Science doesn't just means Mathematical Quantification. It also means recognising pattern of cause and effect, which may not be obvious to be quantified by present constructs of Mathematics. Mathematics like any other field of study is still evolving.

science =/= Atheism

IIT is mainly a tech school. Tech and science has lot of difference. So your question needs further clarity.

The science of spirituality is subjective in nature. Even modern science, especially modern medicine for that matter of fact consider both objectivity and subjectivity while doing their study. Dont think people who go to the Guru's are jobless or failure in life. People personally experience something unique or something that is very subjective for modern science to make any assertive conclusions. Tbh even I was like you!! Good luck!

While the Indian education system and the cultural impact on a person being born and brought up in India can make a person believe in spirituality and the concept of God, I believe I have a more logical explanation for it to happen almost anywhere in the world. 

You see, science by itself has too many blind spots, too many explanations which cannot be proven but exist nonetheless. How can a person just believe these things blindly? How can a person simply digest the fact that a relative of theirs can be ridden with Alzheimer's and can't be treated no matter what? How can one just accept Saturn's hexagonal storms and not wonder what causes them? A person with a limited thinking capability and a limited amount of time cannot answer all of the questions that come to a curious mind? 

Now you don't just have one curiosity-ridden mind, but billions of them. One doesn't necessarily have the ability to satisfy every mind's curiosity and hence the ultimate answer to all questions is born: God. Why does everything happen in the world: God wants it that way. Why did my friend's father pass away so early: God wanted him to. Why does the world have 70% water on its surface: God wanted it so. Literally any other question you can think of and the will of God can be attributed to it. For a person who's scared of oblivion most of their lives, the idea of an all powerful, all good entity is comforting, it's a shelter from all the anxiety of not knowing. 

As an extension, people can believe in pseudoscience. It grants them some form of comfort and relief from anxiety. They feel less giddy and can focus more on their lives once the anxiety of existence is out of the way. 

This isn't true for just India. Any person living in any country and following any religion can follow a dogma to allow themselves to have a comfortable existence.

Take what works for you, leave the rest and move on. Maybe the students and professors only care about what's helping make their lives better?

Any good book on philosophy will be far more useful for emotional/spiritual answers than any of these babas but ofcourse its simplistic to expect everyone should read these books.

The man you are talking about has been accused of displacing local villagers, illegally grabbing land from a protected forest, murdering his own wife, making bullshit comments about menstruating women, propagating pseudoscience, and running a whole business empire under the garb of charity. 

Both Ramdev and Sadhguru sell the same churan. Sadhguru wraps it in an English mold. That's the only difference.

This does a good job of explaining the context around the quote. Hope everyone takes the time to understand it.

He is probably the most dumb English speaking guru I have come across. 

I am all for philosophical discussions, in fact the level of philosophical discussions in our country is very low, even though we are the land of Bhagavad Gita - we have a point of view on philosophical discussions which the west has never had. 

But seriously Sadhguru ? Anyone listening to and admiring someone like Sadhguru immediately falls in my respectability spectrum. 

Most things which he says make no sense, most things he says have no basis also. And I am not talking of physical basis. Metaphysical things don't need physical explanation - but metaphysical philosophy can't be pulled from your ass now, can it be ? 

 Plus the delivery of the material is pathetic.

The whole point of establishing a science/technological institute is to encourage scientific thinking among the students. Are we failing somewhere?

Why you think Science and Religion are opposite though. Most top scientists did believe in God or spirituality, maybe not on a particular religion.

Well said

That's interesting but I doubt anyone here learns basic subtraction. And once you get to a certain level of math, our minds aren't good enough to get an intuitive picture of what we are talking about so get used to it

Being religious is fine, but propagating pseudoscience in the garb of philosophy is damaging to the society as a whole.

Purely on the point of Nehru haters, my personal opinion is that those opinions or lines of thought existing in the instutute is not an issue. After all students there have come in through common exams and professors have come through appointment on merit (officially!!). This should be fine even though their beliefs about Nehru may not be positive.
Any institute of learning is always better served by existence of different schools of thought and different beliefs. As long as there is scope for healthy debate all is good.
Indoctrination and radical conformity kills any scope for creativity be it in scientific research or the arts.

>Any subpopulation of India will show cultural characteristics of the general population. So it's not really a surprise to see students/professors at IIT kgp being like that.

Its mostly IKS profs who are like this - most profs I feel have a scientific temperament, and inviting a rando Guru/Saint is easier than getting internationally renowned scientists as visiting lecturers so there are more of the former than the later. Diro's personal choices also play a role, everyone knows how Tiwari got his position.

>Funnier is the sheer number of people at IITs who are Nehru haters. Think of the sheer irony of studying in an institution crafted by the man and hating on him.

If you travel by the railways, you have no right to hate the British /s

Humanities/social sciences is NOT pseudoscience

Well said. Best of Luck for JEE/NEET btw🤙🏻

[deleted]

In science, no one takes any quote coming from anyone just on face value, unless backed by proper analysis and evidence. Scientists can have opinions, but they are not science unless backed up by evidence.

It's like you're inside my head bro!

I suggest you to read this carefully

*Not adhering to pseudoscience = hinduphobic* 🤡
This word is being thrown around so easily. I suggest you understand the meaning of this word before using it in any context

Haha yess, and they do a lot of mental gymnastics to avoid saying this I swear

😂😂

Kaun aya tha?

Disagree. IMO philosophy will make you ask more questions and doesn't really help you with answers in regard to ethics. Morality has always been derived mainly from culture, and people that propagate a certain culture/way of life will always be more appealing to most people than some philosophical book.

You answered it yourself. Its unreasonable to expect everyone to be able to go through dozens of books for something as subjective as spirituality.

>accused of displacing local villagers, illegally grabbing land from a protected forest, murdering his own wife, making bullshit comments about menstruating women, propagating pseudoscience, and running a whole business empire under the garb of charity.

The keyword being "accused of". 

He has responded to most of those allegations, and even state govts that are hostile to him have not arrested him for these "so-called" crimes.

I have watched a YouTube video. Sadhguru and Michio Kaku were sharing the same stage in Russia. Jaggi was trying hard to catch Kaku's attention. Kaku did not even once look at Jaggi.

Nailed it. These babas when they discuss philosophy, they wrap the old wine in new bottle. No thoughts are their original when it makes sense. They appropriate valuable philosophical thought lines from other better philosophers. Then add their own masala of misogyny, patriarchy and religious bs.
Comings to IIT, most students and teachers, they are as intellectually disabled as others. Being good at Maths and Physics is no guarantee of having higher intellectual capability. You can observe this in most IITs conformity attitude. Had they even a bit of phylosiohical intelligence, you wouldn't notice them sleeping on important national topics.

Was Einstein free from religion? Or, Curie madam? Even APJ sir? Maybe you're taking the wrong lane?

In India the whole point of education is to earn good money. Ethics, morality, rationality are all bookish things in India.

Humans are capable of doublethink, quite a well-researched behavioral topic, Top scientists are not immune to this. Science and religion are indeed very very opposite in most ways. 

Science is not just the body of conclusions or theories or the experiments that validates these theories. An achievement of science has also been that through iterations over hundreds of years, it has created a framework/system to maintain integrity, self-correct if there are mistakes. It is diametrically opposite to religion

* in its axioms
* in its anaytical processes
* in its organizational structure
* in its self-correcting systems
* In its accurate documentation procedures

This is a very broad gist. It would take a book to completely show how different religious/spritual and scientific processes are.

Because of these systems in place, scientific processes have been able to extract out useful/good body of work from its practioners while avoiding any unreliable bias-ridden quirks or blindspots they might have. Ofcourse even the scientific process is not perfect as shown by the recent stanford University scandals. Goes to show how difficult it is to keep human failings from negatively affecting our knowledgebase. yet, it is light years ahead of any religious or spiritual work which is effectively just the unverified, untested musings of whoever that was able to intutively capture the minds of the population at that time.

By stripping away crucial details and looking from far, it is tempting to say things like "science and religion complement each other" but no, they dont. At best, religion is piggy-backing on top of science to maintain a semblance of credibility while parallely trying its best to undermine the very foundations that keep science strong.

A more correct statement would be that Philosophy and science complement each other. Philosophy does not have the exacting standards of science bit it still uses a subset of scientific processes to make sense of the world around us that science cannot still tackle.

 A lot of Religious leaders/gurus try to dishonestly market themselves as grounded in philosophy though they are not.

Not opposite, but in many ways contradictory;
Anyways if you don’t understand even this, just be the sheep you are, don’t think too much, it’ll hurt your head

who are these top scientists? 
latest surveys by pew show that 41% of scientists don't believe in either god or a 'higher power'. regardless, scientists believing in god wouldn't be a valid argument for science and religion being opposites as that would be appealing to authority (im not entirely sure what you mean by opposites).

science and religion are quite opposites epistemologically where former is largely empirical and the latter is largely not

Blud you just proved the comment before you

Well they are opposites. Religion is about faith and submission. Science is about change and evidence.

There are actually not a lot of religious top scientists. Besides, not all sciences are equal, you can easily be a microbiologist who just publishes papers and believe in God but these are the kind of people who aren't using science to understand the world. They are siloed in their area.

Science and religion are completely opposite to each other. People will get beheaded even if they state facts about religion. Let alone question their practices and purposes.

Not modern scientists. Most modern theoritical scientists are agnostic or straight up atheists.

Scientists believing in god or religion is not a result of them being scientists.

I mean , try to get them hooked to the subject in a manner familiar to them . I woukd further encourage a formal study of religion for student. Like it or not , it shapes us , so one better have a thorough knowledge of it .

It’s not pure science either. What’s it doing in a hard tech. engineering institute? Propagating progressivism and yawwwwns in class?

More than 2 genders believers are in IITs.. what about that?

>Humanities/social sciences is NOT pseudoscience

Its not even science. It is just mostly fake nonsense.

Let me try. 

"I don't like you"
"I am not perfect"

There, see. Two things right at once. :-) 

On the second part, many top scientists of the world have been believer of some religion. Sometimes not religion, but some superior power. So you mean these top scientists didn't believe in Science? You know more science than them?

Well they given this status by analysis of philosophy of Vedanta not by opinions now philosophy is definitely not mathematically proven but science is but that doesn't mean it's wrong

Precisely - old wine in a new bottle! On top of that, some gurus like Sadhguru claim that they have not even read the scriptures or anything, and all thoughts are their own, but have been caught many a time stealing lines of other babas. These babas actually stand against all kinds of spirituality.

Well said. Most of Jaggi's talks are borrowed and modified versions of the likes of Alan Watts, Jiddu Krishnamurthy and others.

Just because scientists are 'not free from religion' according to you, it doesn't justify pseudoscientific thought in a scientific institution.

Science is based on logic+evidence whereas religion is based on personal faith. Problem is when some pseudo gurus try to come up with a scientific basis for religion or religious practices, mostly based on lies or fake evidence, and sadly many educated people are fooled by their pseudoscientific buzzwords. 
My point is - shouldn't we, the students and professors of IIT, know better?

The problem is since religion claims to everything. It claims to be the definitive word on

* science
* medicine
* philosophy
* spirituality
* society

So, it is easy to paint everyone as religious. Einsteins definition of religion is completely different from an average sadhguru follower.

Albert Einstein's views on religion were complex. He described himself as agnostic.He rejected the idea of a personal God who intervenes in human affairs or answers prayers in a traditional religious sense.

Marie Curie was raised in a devout Catholic family in Poland.While Curie respected the moral and ethical teachings of her Catholic upbringing, she did not maintain a strict adherence to religious practices or doctrines in her adult life.

On the contrary APJ Abdul Kalam was a devout Muslim and his faith played a significant role in his life. Kalam often spoke about the importance of spirituality and the influence of his religious beliefs on his values and work.This quote of him i really loved - For great men, religion is a way of making friends,small people make religion a fighting tool.

But all these people were not the proponents of pseudo science in any way like some the babas and their followers do.

Even if they followed a religion, they never let it affect their scientific works. Nor did they blindly follow all the pseudo scientific beliefs in religion

Einsteins religion wasn't one like modern religion.

Science is not axiomatic though

Beautifully said

Yes, humans are also capable of thinking in the wrong direction. That is why they listen before making a conclusion. At least you should try it yourself, before generalizing the whole scenario. Even the scientific community doesn't approve of this.

As you defined Philosophy, where do we think humans derive their morals from? Where do you think they derive their laws from? 
For example, most laws in European countries existed since Roman Empire times, which were based on religion.

Religion was mankind's first attempt at science, aka understanding the world.

The ones who were honest about finding answers, moved ahead of the religious processes and behaved scientifically.

They questioned their own findings if there was enough proof to contradict it, and strived to improve.

Religions ended up being a closed loop, where you do not question beliefs, but put your everything into justifying them. Except for some "improvements", that generally created religions more extreme than the previous one, with even lesser scope of questioning the teachings.

Now religion is an island, that is continuously shrinking because it relies on "but... science still cannot explain this, so it must be my only true god". Science keeps explaining more and more of the initial curiosities, and the religious beliefs born out of human curiosity, is working on killing the same curiosity.

Interestingly, I have seen people who claim that they became religious while trying to find the answers to their questions as an atheist. While in reality, they still do not have answers to those questions, they now just feel awkward and guilty repeating those same questions. They have learned the art of not questioning.

Was about to reply but saw your post history.

What about rest 59 percent?

Religion is about the way of life. About psychology. About togetherness. 
Science possibly can't replace these.

Nobody is using Science to understand the "world"

That's my point.

Modern scientists? 
I am talking about accomplished ones, who are generally old.

Not always.Formal study of religion does not usually generate scientific temper.For example Islamic Madrasas are well known to be outdated on the things that they speak,the books of Hinduism and Christianity also do .It's either Proto science or pseudo science which is there in it. It is to be expected because of the fact that most religious texts were written more than 1000 years ago.The world and science has advanced miles after that .It would not make sense to go back to exactly those in the past when there are better alternatives available today.

That's another debate (and 100% agree on the yawn part), but the methods they use are still based on logic and actual data/evidence

Learn difference bw sex and gender

For most of them it's just pure business.

For a while I used to get ads of sadguru in YouTube, even though I hate him fully. Since then I've gave feedback to YouTube not to reccomend his videos and now my feed is Cleaner.

But I do believe there's something which the materialistic science can't fully explain. I do listen to talks by Sarvapriyananda, Alan watts and read a bit of continental philosophy. They do touch a part of metaphysics can't be researched easily. 

Even Einstein used to be a avid fan of spinozas God. The concept of spinozas God have similar anologies in quantum physics where they Conceptualize universe as one big wavefunction.

Obviously theories and probably not fully true.

But majority of these "Gurus" are self help guys professing their own opinions. IIT isn't the place for that.

With pathetic delivery. He also borrows from Osho. Or at least tries to.

You're reading the comment the opposite way.

Define what is logic and evidence according to your understanding?
Western science is rooted in reductionism philosophy that can be broadly characterized into Ontological reductionism, Methodological reductionism and Theory reductionism. Reductionism also doesn't preclude the existence of **Emergent Phenomena** but rather approaches the observation from higher level to refine the understanding to finer levels but even this approach hits a bedrock where certain *things* are accepted *as they are*. So what is the source of that prime mover, what's its nature, how to define and characterize something that can't be defined from a reductionist point of view? 

Organised religion and spirituality are two separate entities, the way you are conflating them to be the same alludes to shallow reasoning. It is naive to think knowing a small subset of applied science (read Engineering) in a specific domain implies one can be stalwart of logical reasoning. 

As a student of science your professors are on that inquisitive path to discover new ways to understand the nature of this universe, and some of the texts and reasoning from spiritual gurus at least attempt to offer a plausible explanation. 

Dive deep into your engineering field and when you stare into the abyss of the unknown, you will be humbled by the amount of things you don't know. 

P.S. Approaching evidence is subjective and hence a topic of discussion for another time. Need to cleanse this blob of mass with sodium salt of fatty acid before the pressure induced atmospheric convection disperse biomolecular secretions and saturate the local control volume of my room.

Actually the religion in focus here, doesn't claim anything as far as I've understood and only gives frameworks and ideas which are always discussed and is evolving unlike many abrahamic religions.

Also, just to be fair Sadhguru followers are not religious followers, cause Sadhguru himself didn't read the scriptures.. he mainly focuses on topics other than core religion.

>APJ Abdul Kalam was a devout Muslim

Source? He was never a devout Muslim. Instead, his Muslim colleagues used to call him a Brahmin as he used to read Bhagvad Gita every morning.

So you're claiming all your professors and fellow students are?

Exactly my point! Everyone is entitled to have their own belief, but it's important to know what is belief and what is science!

The religion in focus here isn't strict like the modern religions you're hinting at.

It is.

It will take some time to get this. Because the brainwashing has been happening for centuries.

Religion was mankinds first attempt at governing or establishing control over people. It never was about understanding the world. A few attempts that were made were outliers , not the norm.

Bhai sahab lmaooo

Replacing something that doesn't even exist? How does that work. I can see the "togetherness" in millennia of history. It's not about psychology, it's about a delusion. It harms your ideals and makes you support idols that have committed ridiculous actions in there respective fairy tales. It makes someone's morality worse than a child. It diminishes critical thinking and promotes submission even in the absence of evidence, even at the face of opposing evidence. Science brings us together. It gives an indian child living in slums the idea of stepping on the moon. It tells us the we share so much of our genes even with every living being on earth. It tells us that we're the cosmos itself, that we have no reason to consider anyone as different and lower or higher of importance and respect. An invention made by someone at the other end of the world, saves someone's life who doesn't even know how big the world is. Now THAT is what i call togetherness.

>Religion is about the way of life. About psychology. About togetherness.

it also makes claims on the phenomenons of universe which is opposite to science on how it claims to know (epistemologically)

>Science possibly can't replace these.

it doesn't attempt to

Most of them were atheists/agnostic bruh

Modern scientists are not accomplished. Every heard of the shoulders of giants thing. 

Also a lot of old scientists in the Renaissance were hampered by religion. Issac Newton, for example, is perhaps the greatest physicist of all time. Yet, he devoted more of his time to study occult and alchemy, rather than physics and mathematics. Studies that led him nowhere, and created zero knowledge for the world.

Hinduism , at least, has its traditional scholars saying that even if the Vedas say that "fire cools" ,one cannot except it against common experience. In that case , it must be interpreted in other ways ( l am quoting Shankaracharya, Ramanujacharya and Madhvacharya her. In Hinduism , shastras are ultimate evidence only for those things ( gods ,heavens etc.) that can be known only through them. For every other thing , Hindus have kept on enquiring .

Freedom of thought and expression (even to have discussions with Sadhguru) has no place in the campus you say?

Both are the same and both are binary.

Yes. He copies Osho also.

Many of them are (atleast the students that I know of). As are some of the profs. Last year, there was even a calendar with nonsense like ancient India having planes and what-not

When you are able to convince people, that you understand the world around them, and can explain or even fix their problems, then you automatically have control over people. The catch being that you don't really have to fix those problems, you just need to get them to believe that you can.

Sadly, science has been used in the same way by few people. There are a bunch of paid researches, and there are studies that have found out that 80-90% of sponsored research dsoe not conclude against the interests of the sponsoring party.

I am no fan of religion, but for a fair argument, we do need to differentiate between a concept/practice, and the misuse of the said practice. Most actions of religious people do not follow the morals preached in their religions. Similarly, a lot of work by scientists does not follow the scientific methodology.

This is not to compare religion and science one to one. As I already said, religion is just a version of mankind's attempt to understanding the world, that refused to path correct and grow. Those who were open to learn, verify, unlearn, and learn again, moved on to the scientific path. Religion is way too outdated, to be compared against science in today's world. But there are intentional imperfections on both sides.

You can always say that people's actions done in the name of science, with vested interests, is not science's mistake, and you won't be wrong.

But at the same time, religious people can make similar claims. And they won't be wrong either.

Can Science answer purpose of life?

I think you’re getting him wrong buddy

What he means to say is, Sadhguru is the exact opposite for what your institute stands for. That is, logical thinking. 

Even though Social Science isn’t pure science, it’s based on proofs, history, observations, and logic. Whereas your spirituality isn’t based on any of the above. Hence the name “Pseudo-science”

Sex refers to “the different biological and physiological characteristics of males and females, such as reproductive organs, chromosomes, hormones, etc.” Gender refers to "the socially constructed characteristics of women and men – such as norms, roles and relationships of and between groups of women and men.

We do believe our ancestors conceptualized air travel, and our books reflect that long before wright brothers existed, do you want to just ignore that level of intelligence to think of those concepts just cause it's ancient India?

I'm bit confused with your reasoning.

>When you are able to convince people, that you understand the world around them, and can explain or even fix their problems, then you automatically have control over people. The catch being that you don't really have to fix those problems, you just need to get them to believe that you can.

>As I already said, religion is just a version of mankind's attempt to understanding the world,

you are contradicting yourself. Religion was mankind's attempt at governing people, not to understand the world. you actually agree to it in your first paragraph but forget it later. Science had no such origins. It infact innocently started as a way to validate religion(not universally but still) but had to slowly deviate away as it became more and more clear that religious canons are bullshit. 

Religious apologists ,esp today defend religion by stretching analogies to ridiculous levels and through whataboutisms. Rest of your response is the same.

Well yes. To feed and breed successfully. Even if you find it to be an insufficient answer, by no means the answer can be a need for a magical world after you die. If you want an answer by fairy tales, fine go on. If not, care about thinking and finding it.

yes. that is the ultimate purpose of science. Science seeks to understand in the world, and in turn, understand the reason of our existence.

yes and the answer is: no objective purpose, a product of an organism's evolved trait to continue one's species. existence precedes essence

Many religions make that claim. No one is stopping anyone from practicing their religions. But, please do not preach nonsense like these or invite grifters like Sadhguru.

And those books are not enough proof of anything. Unless there's archeological evidence, the interpretations of religious texts as science is blatantly false or misleading. Anyone can write whatever they want in a book. And while different interpretations existing is a good thing, promoting one interpretation as the truth (while having 0 evidence to back it up) while demonizing the people who believe in a different interpretation is what I'm specifically talking about

I'm sure a lot of people living away from ancient India at that time 'conceptualized' air travel as well.

No, I am not contradicting myself. You are just unable to understand it, in your rush to counter a half-understood argument. You are forcing your brain to ignore the nuances of the argument, by pretending to think in binary. You are mixing my arguments about "how religion started", and "what it is today", and then claiming contradictions.

Religion was an attempt to understand the world. It was an output of the early curiosity of mankind. And obviously, they got most of the things wrong. But no one was making up gods, and doing meditations, to control people. At least not initially.

And you said,

>It infact innocently started as a way to validate religion(not universally but still) but had to slowly deviate away as it became more and more clear that religious canons are bullshit

&#x200B;

This is literally what I have been trying to explain. Religion started with the right reasons (even if with wrong explanations). But soon the religious people realized that people fear the unknown, and if you give them a false sense of knowledge, in the name of God, and associate yourself with that god in some way, messenger, avatar, prophet, divine connection, or anything else, they will fear you as well. And with fear, comes obedience and control.

Those who found value in the kind of control that religion gives them, made their religions more and more rigid, and lost the initial benefit of "curiosity" that they started with. They also tried their best to destroy other religions, who didn't follow the same rigid structure. And that's why, a lot of older religions are still less rigid, overall. (older religions are mostly non-existent today, btw)

That's when they started misusing their stronghold on the society. Witch-burning, sexist rules for women (which apparently came from the God), casteism, violence towards atheists and those following other religions, and a lot more followed after that.

Even within the scientific community, you can see people who are actually doing research for the welfare of the humanity. But there are those, who have seen value in "appeal to authority", and understood that people respect those who seem to "know better". Ranging from toothpaste advertisements where some actors are wearing white coats, and claiming 90% doctors recommend XYZ toothpaste, to doctors prescribing medicines based on commission structure, to even a lot of research labs, that do research on "supari", and would bend the numbers for you, to get a tailor-made certification for your products.

You may find this to be a "stretched analogy", but such people, inherently, aren't much different from those who used religion for their own benefit. They are working on the same incentives as the priests of different religious institutes.

But because science still has an ever-growing nature, such people keep getting overridden by actual science. But it's a cat-mouse chase, that will go on forever.

You are making silly assumptions about my arguments, because you are unable to understand the difference between "what is" and "what was".

You think that because religions and most religious people are fucked up today, we should just keep repeating the same rhetoric about how religions originated. But no, if you look at what were religions doing a few thousand years ago, you will feel that they were mostly into "thought experiments" and sometimes "actual experiments". Those two gradually evolved into philosophy and science. What was left, was a rigid ball of mud.

You can't just take sides, when actually analyaing something. But you feel that someone not repeating "religion is bad", "religion was bad", etc, must be religious.

That's why you assume that me, an agnostic, is a "religious apologist", and making strawman arguments yourself, by not countering my actual argument, but by trying to label or change them to something that you can easily wrap your brain around.

And lol, only the god (not sure which one) knows what made you feel that I am defending any religion. Most likely, you have an imaginary image of me, in your mind, that you are trying to fight. And hence you unable to even understand my arguments. Ironically that's exactly how religious people behave in almost every aspect.

See, that's why it's no fun. That is why science does not actually add a value in my life. 
Personally, I have seen followers of a religion are much more calm and collected than others.

So it can't answer it yet, right?

Is that thr purpose of your life? 
Coz that ain't the "purpose" of mine.

So You agree to practicing and not preaching? Both are bundled together for most religions.. while some only preach, some propagate or, force spread . But that's not the topic. .

Sadhguru isn't a nonsense, cause his lifestyle and other advice actually work so people follow. He isn't a religious speaker to be very frank.

Maybe we should acknowledge them also.. instead of just bashing them to oblivion

>I have seen followers of a religion are much more calm and collected than others.

Never heard a stupider statement in a while. I guess you have never read History. Or News.

nor can religion, not in any certifiable way. It can, however, make up a purpose of life, but we can never be sure whether it is the correct purpose or not.

i don't have any purpose or meaning, i find the search to be futile. regardless, science doesn't really much attempt to give you a meaning or purpose to life, it is an empirical inquiry of the phenomenons in our universe

But I have seen a bit of reddit.. hehe

I never said I am undermining Science. 
I am just trying to prove why religion and spirituality are important as well.

Title: IIT Kharagpur Campus Tour in 1 Minute!

Almost got nostalgic after looking at glimpses of my second home... Missing the fragrance of our beautiful campus...

Tech M?

supdup!

IIT KGP ki feel jiske liye jee ka grind Kara.

not an iitian , been there once , there were goosebumps and it was ecstatic to see the celebration of engineering, it felt like a shrine to me.

Did you have to take the permission of the campus admin to shoot the video?

ug 2nd year here

Enjoy your time there mate.....

Jo bhi bolo iit toh ek feel hai emotion hai

================================================================================

Title: True Representation of IIT KGP

Students mental health is unfortunately low on the institutes list of concerns

lmao we back to 2020 stickers again

The Admin actually has taken steps to make available resources for help. The thing is people don't try them based on their long gone reports. I agree, they used to be bad, but there are various new options made available. Try them once.

**IIT KGP is just full of cowards and selfish people now. Students, admin, staff – nobody has a backbone anymore.** 
 
I'm just so tired of IIT KGP right now.

Everyone here – students, admin, staff – we've all just become so damn selfish and scared. Nobody wants to stand up for anything. Nobody wants to make waves.

You know what really messed me up? I remember when exams got cancelled after another suicide, and people were actually celebrating. CELEBRATING. Someone just died and we're cheering about extra study time?

That's where we are now. That's what we've become.

The administration sends a generic email and moves on. The staff stays quiet. And we students? We just keep our heads down, worry about our own grades, our own placements, and pretend like everything's fine.

When did we stop caring about each other? When did we lose our humanity?

This place used to mean something. Now it just feels... hollow.

We posting 2020 sticker images?

perfect rep

Yes

I will say time and again. Talk to your parents and family everyday. You will definitely survive. I did that only during my stay in kgp

Guys download the setu app, it won't solve your problems entirely but it will definitely be a help

It's iitd

I am posting this after reaching out to the counselling centre. Bottom line is everyone wants to protect themselves from blame and students mental health is concerning to them only as long as it doesn't affect them

I used to be suicidal. I have experienced it first hand. I have made it my mission to help bring changes that will actually help students like me. I have been planning and thinking. Right now my doctor has advised not to engage in anything stressful. I am also considering his advice. Sooner or later I will do something

Now? Dude, it has been the same for more than 30 years. 

Whatever you are observing is just a buildup of inaction among everyone including you people. 
Now, you would ask what was your mistake. You completely ignored what the seniors and passouts have suffered, and just care about the present situation. Tum log bhi bhagidar ho is paap me. 

During my time, the counselors used to be good actually.

Never helped in depression, ever. 

What you suggested was followed by every iitian 15 years ago. Nobody needed to remind them to talk to parents through a reddit post.

It does no help, I have downloaded and checked, there is no data for Facad/Mental help/Hostel Warden, no appointment can be booked as of now.

Just to be alive , and sane we need setu app, that's like very non intuitive
So I will soon have trust issues with myself that if I am ok not and if I am not ok then prolly my descision of using setu app is not ok too

Beta, ye pichle 30 years se chal raha hai. Naya kuch batao

DM me. I have been through something similar in my 4th year. Mental health is a priority for me now.

Bhai matlab, this way it's not the setu app, nothing can help you

Better to go to dentist if there is really some issue in teeth,
I sometimes feels am I too much enlightened or common people are too dumb

No offense tho, I live in misery and delusion ig

If you actually know more than others, you will be ridiculed. 

Setu app is a bogus app, using an interface and equipment that actually promotes depression and suicidal tendencies.

Not sarcastic?.. it's stupid isn't it

No cure for depression can be obtained through pc or phone. Screen time screws with brain which is medically proven. 
So, tell me, how will an app, that requires Screen time will help in mental health?

Exactly man, one more escape. We(people) are so full of ourselves, that we even want to escape ourselves through whatever we believe

Right. Trying to escape is a human trait, and a very dumb trait. I won't say I never tried to escape but realisation struck in time and I stopped.

It's never possible to escape reality.

Title: 3 Students got deregistered?

I was recently forwarded a notice about 3 2nd year BTech students from RK Hall getting deregistered for smoking weed? Is it true? And I heard that they are conducting raids everywhere for the past 1 month, haven't come across one myself yet...but can anyone give me any info on what is going on?

Actually they are from RP, Azad and Patel, but dont know why they were in RK

Those 3 students were caught consuming alcohol etc. in Vinod Gupta's room of D-Block (Mr. Vinod Gupta is the most respected alumnus of RK Hall).

The surprising thing I came to know was that none of them are RK hall boarders. Since the evidence was clear, the DC gave them a harsh punishment.

Raids have been going on since last month. They are questioning students, mainly first and second years about their experiences in the hall like whether seniors are behaving properly, basic facilities etc.

In my college I was drinking in the common hall with a cigarette in my other hand and a bond laying besides me, a guard came up to me and I asked him Kya kar rahe ho yahan and he said kuch nahi bhaiya jaa hi Raha bas, i said theek hai jao jao. 

Samajh ni aya mai guard hu ya wo guard hai

Bruh wath... My brother got caught too all they did was fine hin and three other guys 10k each

😯 Heard some major changes are happening in kgp, never expected hostels raids to be one of them.. Rao ji still present in Rk hall? Usually he used to tip us off, once warden found out about weed my friends growing in C block, and Rao ji came to rescue.. good old days

What has happened to the KGP campus? In our times, nobody had any damn idea what's happening inside the hostels. And now these raids and all!

This is an attack on the freedom of residents!!

So glad didnt get into IIT.

These kids being Too high on life

In our college in Kolkata which is of a somewhat similar stature to IITkgp , and is a research institute primarily, 
We can openly drink and smoke weed on campus.

Bro, we've literally had super ballsy acid trips on campus.

Once the warden( who is chosen from among professors) asked me to convey to all hostelers to be responsible and dispose of bottles wisely and not dump them in the common dustbins as the cleaning staff would not clear those out.

The raids are being conducted by the Anti-Ragging Squad(ARS) as its been dubbed, and the frequency is almost daily with some exceptions. I think they try to visit all halls atleast once in a night, they surely do this in the MS, RK, RP section, not sure about the rest, assume its the same. Their initial task was to look for ragging incidents in halls but now they mostly look for alcohol and weed consumption, due to the lack of many incidents of the former. Best to be careful between the times of 9.30PM to 2 AM in halls as they usually come during these hours. Now do with that information what you will. You're welcome.

weed is given such a bad name in india while it has legit medicinal purposes. while tobacco and alcohol are literally the worse kind of drugs to be made legal and that too on such a scale!

GD thaa i guess RK ka

Achha joke tha thoda hans deta hu

Y'all grew your own?💀 Better not dox yourself

There's been a suicide last year due to ap so the raids are primarily for that reason (as ap has been officially canceled). Also the raids are done by anti drug squad

what freedom? smoking weeds and consuming alchol is a freedom? its high time institute stepped up. During my 3rd year, a senior died from achohol poisoning when his "friends" forced him to drink alchohol. no action was taken against those fuckers.

Bengali detected , opinion rejected 👍🏼 (also no college in entire west bengal can be compared to IIT Kgp 
Infact I'd say no college in india should be , but jus for the sake of no controversy IIT B , D , IISc ko hata dete hain

Average Bengal college.

Let me tell you something, I'm a medical student and I don't know why I've been suggested this post. I've seen people go crazy because of weed consumption. Weeds are the kind of drugs we don't have any antidote of. And most people have this mentality that I won't do any excess, but you don't have any control over yourself after you start taking it in excess amounts. One of my juniors is showing psychotic symptoms. And he knew everything before he started smoking weed.

Not him. Vinod Gupta School of Management is named after that alumnus. He also funded for improvement of facilities like mess extension at RK Hall. So his old room has his name board on it and is locked.

They deregistered them for an entire year, forbidding them from holding any sort of PORs and their parents must live with them outside campus if they want to study here. They shouldn't have gone that hard on them.

We did it in IIT Roorkee too. Our warden was the same, our ravindra bhawan was the hub of all such activities. Glad I passed out without any such incidents.

Outrageous!! 

Do you have any brief on such incidents made or raised by any student committee? I will raise this in alumni forum.

Anti Drug Squad? It has profs or the police?

It's a choice of individual whether to smoke or drink. 

>During my 3rd year, a senior died from achohol poisoning when his "friends" forced him to drink alchohol. no action was taken against those fuckers.

This is entirely different incident and not at all related to the conversation here where action wasn't allegedly taken on culprits. 

Just because some boys did xyz things, that shouldn't reflect on the entire student community.

Its freedom of woke culture . Its freedom for current generation . 

same woke culture people were roaming on the streets without mask during peak corona times , Stating they have right to freedom and anyone asking otherwise was infringement of their right . 

There is a reason back in the days " belt treatment " was so popular among parents to teach their kids what not to do.

i think part of the problem is cuz the weed isn’t good quality? Like since there is no regulation, weed sellers use all kinds of tricks like hormones to make their plants grow faster and add various drugs to the soil to make it stronger.

In countries like the US, Canada and Amsterdam, that isn’t the case, the weed is high quality and right off the counter. Rest assured, one can be confident that it is not being tempered with.

Another problem I’ve read about weed in India is that some sellers even lace it with stronger drugs like fentanyl, coke, meth etc, to make it more potent and addictive.

Quality seems to be a major issue here. I would never ever consume any weed in India cuz I know it for sure that it will lead to problems I have no idea of cuz I do not know what exactly I’m consuming.

Tobacco is regulated and quality controlled. I do not know of a single good use of it unlike marijuana which is used in medicines and has benefits and yet, it gets such a bad rep cuz quality. People do not even bat an eyelid and consume so much tobacco cuz it does not seemingly cause any psychotic issues. While cancer due to tobacco is such widespread.

[deleted]

Current student committee are mostly absent and have pretty much done nothing

Aap konse batch se ho? Can I DM u (need some specific fundae)

I'm not entirely sure of it as I've never been visited

Anti ragging squad is comprised of profs...not sure about the anti narcotics squad tho

CBI is also involved indirectly in these raids. Better not to consume such poison. The judge orders a hang by dik till kum punishment mostly in such cases.

its not a choice in a campus that explicitly makes it illegal. you can go outside the campus and do whatever the hell you want.

>It's a choice of individual whether to smoke or drink

I think the issue is it is being done on university property at the end of the day it is their university and their rules. I don't think they'll have any issues if you do it outside (as long as people don't show up drunk to campus and cause a ruckus)

DebSoc member spotted

If you wanna drink and smoke do it somewhere else, not in hostel where you will be directly or indirectly disturbing others.

the current generation need the belt treatment from parents again..

No I'm talking about any weed. Overdose of any weed leads to psychosis.

Thousands of students have broken the rules before these 3. Many of them were spared with fines etc. These 3 got it the worst. I understand your POV but this is still pretty harsh. My friends were like it is better to leave the institute than to follow these rules.

>you can go outside the campus and do whatever the hell you want.

As if Kharagpur is a bustling metropolitan with incredibly hottest party destinations.

The issue lies in the limited entertainment options in Kharagpur. Therefore, authorities should consider granting more autonomy and relaxation, while students ensuring, they do not disrupt the peace or cause disturbances. 

I am not advocating for Kharagpur to become a hub for illicit activities either.

🖕

lmao

i agree with your point. Overdosing on àything is bad indeed. But again, I’ve consumed weed in Canada where it is completely legal but never felt like I needed it all the time. I wonder if that’s the case with weed laced with harder drugs in India which makes people addicted. Just my opinion.

Also, there had never been deaths associated with overdosing weed. The only thing that happens is that people tend to eat more or just laugh their way to sleep.

[deleted]

Wasn't it your choice to take admission here? "Anybody can take a choice on what they consume" 🤡

you have come to party or to study?

That would be an entirely different issue altogether. I think if students legitimately felt options are few then the discussion should have happened first before the secret drinking/smoking began and I think they see it as skirting around the rules and hence the harsh punishment.

Apparently previously they used to be only fined but they've upped the intensity of the punishment since it hasn't deterred people

Even if Kgp were to become a bustling hub of watering holes and nightclubs, most UG students would still have nowhere to go till they're 21 and probably in their final year. I'd imagine that at that point they're pretty much too busy to breathe?

Bruh why would you want to do drugs

Whether you want to believe it or not, weed IS a drug. It IS addictive.

Idk why are you advocating weeds this much.

Yes, weed might not have caused death in patients but is very much responsible for psychosis. Not just a temporary one, but causing cannabis induced psychosis. 

We've been told by our psychiatrist professors, how many such cases they have to deal with, where patients have developed psychosis due to weed consumption and no it is not related to quality of weed.

Alcohol intoxication can be saved because we have antidote for this.

This punishment will make little to no change. Other students will still continue to do those activities, even now as we debate. Careful ones will escape. Stupid ones will get caught. If every rule breaker deserves to be punished like this, half of KGP would be emptied.

It was and I had a fantastic time almost a decade back. 

We haven't had any issue in campus doing whatsoever we want, ask your warden and he will tell you what I am talking about.

Aren’t u guys consuming things illegally?

If u in this country then follow the law

Drinking is still illegal under 21 and consumption of drugs is too 

It’s high time u focused on studies and made our country proud instead of fighting for things like fictitious freedom of drinking alcohol

Tu Iitian nahi hai na?
Sach bta.
Jal rha abhi tak JEE nahi nikla tha to

Weed isn't as addictive as it might be projected to be. Alcohol and even caffeine are much more addictive with clear withdrawal symptoms if you try to leave it. Weed doesn't have any physical withdrawal but sure you might crave it a bit if you do it too regularly. Its definitely possible to have a functional work ethic even with regular weed consumption as I found out during my stay in Canada, with 0 repurcussions if you abruptly stop. As to why someone would want to do that, its a matter of personal choice. I'm definitely not suggesting anyone to do it in India because as one person mentioned the material is unregulated here and of really bad quality, but makes you think why alcohol, tobacco, etc doesn't get such a bad rep and is legal to consume in most states. The hypocrisy is palpable.

Overuse of tobacco leads to lung cancer, overuse of alcohol leads to liver failure, overuse of sugary food leads to diabetes, overuse of oily food leads to cholesterol and so on. Trying to justify banning a product based on its effects on people who abuse it isn't really a strong argument. Also as to "why are you advocating weed so much", I'm literally not. I explicitly mentioned not to do it in India or for that matter in any country where its illegal. Doing it in countries where its legal is a matter of personal choice. Just because some people abuse the drug doesn't mean there isn't an abundance of people who use it responsibly.

You are right. But I don't believe weed/alcohol should be counted as freedom here.

PAN loop se hai na? :-P

Xi-jinping asli ID se aao !

Lol. You just pulled that out of your ars? Where did I say I consume anything. Bruh lmao. No, I don't drink nor I smoke nor I allow anybody in my room who does.

true. most people do not even realize that sugar is faar more addictive and causing a massive healthcare issue due to heart diseases, inflammation, brain diseases like dementia, Alzheimer’s/Parkinson’s, diabetes etc. 

Future generations will look at us the way we look at our past gens which consumed coke in coca cola and used to give it to kids to calm them down.

Weed gets a really bad name cuz its illegal, thanks to the US pressuring India into banning it so pharma companies in the US could sell us their meds laced with weed and make billions of dollars.

And as with anything, morals tends to follow the law. So the society thinks if its illegal, it must be immoral.

Weed is actually pretty helpful for mental health issues. If we consume edibles, then even smoking issues also go away. My childhood trauma went away which I wasn’t even aware I had buried deep down cuz I didn’t have memories from when I fell into an open drain.

It helped me unwind a bit during the weekends. Alcohol is the worse drug to be made legal, it causes aggression in people, so many references of people beating their partners after drinking, drunk dialing only happens on alcohol, alcohol is a depressant, tobacco has zero medicinal purposes, it only causes cancer.

Weed makes you happy, calm, you’re able to look at the brighter side of life.

Ofc, no one should get into it to such an extent that it starts hampering with their normal day to day life.

That said, had I discovered weed during my high school, I’d surely have done so much better in life cuz I’d not have to go thru so much stress of all the exams and studies with no coping mechanisms at all!

It shouldn’t considering it’s illegal for people under 21 and drugs are blanket ban

Title: How was the scene at IIT KGP?

6 1Cr+ offers only on day0 this year

Instead of asking these futile questions go study

Society expects if you don't get 1Cr package then, it's not worth getting into IIT. All the best everyone

1cr+ is pennies when converted back to its original foreign currency.

[removed]

Mbbs leke barbad hi hora hu sirf 😀

Focus on the election results which are in the top right corner of the pic 😁

This is exactly what we should NOT be celebrating in news. It send a false message in kid's mind that life and success, everything is just about money and high paying jobs. Good on the people who got what they deserved, but i think we should promote better values instead. For example, go after what tickles your mind and what really makes you want to study and work hard. Even if it pays half as much, it will still keep you fulfilled and happy rather than a job that you really don't want from the inside but are running like rats to achieve.

Do a favor, please stay away from this 1cr bs. Rather focus on getting good company and role, you will reach there eventually if you are consistent enough.

And before preaching US, it has its own difficulties witch is not always easy to handle at your age.

Bruhh 1 Cr packages aren't EVERYTHING

Baat to sahi hi hai.Mere bagal main khokha wala bhi ab 1 crore kama Raha hai

It is not pennies. 1cr+ is greater than 100k us dollars , which is more than double of the average income there.

[deleted]

Many of these 1+cr offers are also domestic, for example, in HFTs. So I think you shouldn't talk about things that you don't know anything about. You can drink your copium privately.

Abusive Language will not be tolerated.

tu mereko dhang se rehke dikha de sf mein 100k ke saath bhai family ka ca bana dunga mein tujhe

The US for example, does not have a MRP on most prices. So prices of commodities vary from state to state. Also they have statewise tax. So 100k is a lot for someone in Texas, but makes you about middle class in the Bay Area. Some would say it’s low if you’re thinking of starting a family.

Broooo escaped the matrix , bro knows the value of ex, bro's him

Light mode ew

>tu mereko dhang se rehke dikha de sf mein 100k ke saath bhai family ka ca bana dunga mein tujhe

Haa ek 22 saal ka recent grad family ke sath rhega na, for 1 guy 100k is more than enough even in bay area.

Bhai mereko diwalde $100k ki job mai to road pe re lunga utne din america mai fhir wapas aajaunga paisa kamane ke baad

20% STATE , 40% CENTRAL, YOU ARE LEFT WITH 45K USD. NOW TAKE RENT 2K, HERE GOES 24K AND NOW YOU HAVE 21K BASICALLY 16 LAKHS FOR FOOD TRANSPORTATION AND SURVIVAL

100k for a bachelor doesnt cover shit, u/Ashamed-Elk9844 ke calcs dekho, and he has had mercy with his rent numbers from personal experience its closer to 3k, leaving you with 19k for everything else, you'll barely survive! Almost the same scene for Boston. food might be a bit cheaper not sure will need to ask some cousins.

Also bay area has the highest price for gas(petrol), high crime, racism towards first gen immigrants. Good luck.

How poor people live there if this is the condition of someone getting monthly some money

I WAS VERY VERY EASY HERE , rent is sometimes 3200 usd / month as per my friend in the bay area

That's like asking how poor will live near Marine drive or alike. Bay area is a very expensive area to live and any financial issues could bring to the street overnight

like people get job offers for 1,65,000 dollars for sde in my company negotiate it to 2,15,000 to save atleast 40k dollars in an year its that expensive

&#x200B;

parity between mumbai and newyork is 1 crore in newyork is like 22.4 lakhs in mumbai.

Tax bhi lagta hai 

100k is nothing in Bay area, homeless crack cocaine addict ban jaega gareebi mei

Mujhe india ka pata hai isliye india ka nahi pucha.Usa ka nahi janata isliye to puch raha hu.Mujhe to usa lagta hai koi garib nahi hai

Just example de Raha tha, lekin USA me homelessness ek bada issue he especially big cities (LA , NYC especially infamous he), drug aur guns to alag hi level PE hi udhar. Garibo ke liya jaga nahi udhar.

Title: Thank You IITKGP!

I don't think we give the institute enough credit for all that it has done for us. You have no idea how deeply I am indebted to this esteemed institution.

I still remember, back in my school days, I used to spend all my days playing videogames and not studying. Fortunately, when I joined kgp, gaming was blocked on the campus internet. So, I stopped playing videogames and started focusing more on my studies. 

However, there were also other things trying to distract me from my studies- I got a girlfriend, and she wanted to have sex with me every day. However, she couldn't enter the boys' halls, so we decided to wait until marriage to do it, and focus on our studies instead.

We now study in the library daily. It's a good thing that shorts are banned in the library, since I easily get distracted from my studies when I see a beautiful pair of ankles.

Since almost all websites are blocked on the campus internet, when I'm taking a break from studies, I watch coding videos on YouTube and mail profs with Gmail.

I'm so glad that I'm in an institute with such bright road signs and such a beautiful gate. I can still remember my depression evaporating away when I first saw those bright road signs... I don't really see the need for a good counselling center when the institute is already doing so much for it's students.

I would send a picture of the happy, studious boy that I have become, but reddit images don't work anymore on campus internet- I'm sure the institute will have a good reason for it :)

I almost died laughing at this :']]]. Thanks to iitkgp for providing electricity which charged my mobile so that I can read this post.

Thank you IITKGP for teaching me that life is all about mind games... I can now rate mess food 10/10.

"However, **she couldn't enter the boys' halls**, so we decided to wait until marriage to do it,".... She couldn't or she wouldn't??

> I got a girlfriend, and she wanted to have sex with me every day

where do you people find these girls, my girlfriend is like opposite of this, where as me opposite of her :sedlyf:

Love it! You could try stand up comedy man!

Whats the point of having a student representative when they cannot even be held accountable for all of this bullshit going on in campus.....Samarth Singh follows the director around like a loyal sick dog, spineless chutiya

Never seen anyone so devoid of any shame and respect

so much optimism, we need to learn from him.

Lmao. This sub hits harder than the kgp confessions page.

Almost all student council members that are elected periodically regardless of tsg or hall council are spineless sycophants. Their sole purpose is to just add this stuff to their resume . Nothing else. I have stopped voting for them long back. No point in listening to their crap. Because nothing gets followed up. My motivation is to just focus and get out of this hellhole. I have given up on administration long back. These scums can’t even get a Wiley or a world scientific subscription on top of that blocked sites like libgen.

Nice man salute to u 

Kahan se aate hain ye log

Girls are not allowed in boys hall but u must be doing it in BUDA

I realized after reading it again, i'm kinda sleep deprived right now preping for 4th (and possibly final) round of technical interviews (fte), which is scheduled tomorrow, really scared/stressed/confident, fear of the unknown is scary

I meant boys or girls wearing shorts

Owhkk....Then don't forget to get some rest before daybreak...hope everything works out...wish you the best of fortunes :)

Title: I hate this college

These people always boast about how big the campus is but always fail to realise it also has the most amount of students and they have absolutely no place to accommodate people in any event.
You may ask why am I so angry about it, it's because of today's mini marathon where first of all the registration was offline and started late, they ran out of t shirts, numbers, caps and then when our turn finally came they told us to go run without them, and that's okay I understand it's hard to predict how many people will come (even though they were wrong by a very big margin) but at least now you know how many people have come right? Because in the checkpoints there were like 20 bottles of water only? And once they were over they never found the need to add more for some reason and this was the case in EVERY checkpoint, and when the marathon ended there were just 3 cartons of refreshment, which were being eaten by the seniors who did the registration process who had not a single drop of sweat in their body and the faculty members who stopped running after like 100m so in the end, in the people who ACTUALLY ran only maybe 30 of them got something to eat and the rest of us who gave it our all and worked so hard? Nothing. 
And the failures are not only isolated to this incident, every program or intro sem starts like an hour late every time, to "include" the people who came late they punish the people who came on time.
From the moment I stepped in I have only been treated like my time has absolutely no value and i think that will be the case moving forward

No use overthinking about it. No one gives a f about others here, you just need to mind your own business and hope not to get involved in any trouble.

I don't know its a me issue or something, I never see something being organized on time like bro, if its 7pm pls start at 7pm, if u want to meet at 9pm pls come at 9pm...it's a basic courtsey which 95% of indians don't have.

Isiliye mai nhi aaya

The problem isn't with the numbers, it's just bad principles and management

Please mail to the higher authority about this. If you want change, you have to take some steps, else things won't change.

if you are not fachha, then you should not tell that thing because you are the one who have elected the the VP and other members of the Gymk council. 
At the moment of election everyone just see that he is from my state i will vote him, He give me a bl\*\*job last time so i will vote him. 
instead of thinking about actually eligible candidate everyone thinks to vote on the basis of various discriminations. And they start blaming the council when their so called elected homies mess everything in their tenure. (also they do not give a fuck about you after election) 
if you are a fachha, 
WELCOME TO KGP BUDDYY!!!!!!!!!!!😊

The originator should forward this as mail to Director, Dean student affairs, Dean student welfare and President TSG, let this be an introspection on the raising day to bring about a change, if they have the will and inclusiveness should be a new normal from now on and for the balance activities planned for the platinum jubilee celebrations.

bs old faculty peeps , they don't even run and still want everything

Tumhare seniors ka ye sab kiya dhara hai

Definitely not by hall pacts.

There are people in IIT doing PhD and MTech who are having years of experience having worked in projects and operational roles in corporate. There are army and Air Force officers in the campus, currently doing PhD and MTech. These people can do a far better job organizing campus events than Gymkhana office bearers. 

Will you or any BTech, or any BTech hall, ever consider voting for them over your own batchmates?

Fair enough

even if you post, ye btao tumhare pass proof h ki woh log deny na kr paye unki shortcomings ko?

Title: Yet another death of a KGPian

Happened in the D block of BRH. Likely suicide. Not yet sure. Police and institute authorities just arrived to take away his lifeless body. PhD guy from ME.

Edit: Suicide is confirmed. The name of the deceased is Harsh Kumar Pandey. Room D557, BRH. 2nd year PhD scholar. From all the conversations, the reason seems academic (department and prof related).

Suicide confirmed. Please take care and look out for others in difficult times. The rat race isn't bigger than anyone's life. Stay well guys.

So that’s 6 suicides and 1 accidental death this year?

IIT KGP- the soil that gave birth and life to freedom fighters, now is a place where students are battling for their lives to come out alive. So sad and feeling helpless, as a final year, i feel grateful to survive this place(till now), but also feel sad for my juniors who have recently come or those who are yet to come. 
 
 Be that approachable person, guys. There is much more beyond academics.

It's the second one this sem right?

When we enter a place like IIT, we are surrounded by students who were toppers in their schools, districts, and sometimes even states. Almost everyone here has been “the best” somewhere. But what happens when all these toppers come together? The competition becomes more intense than ever before. Suddenly, the title of “topper” is no longer enough, and a new rat race begins.
Here, that race often revolves around one number: the CGPA. In the mess, in the hostels, during class breaks ......conversations turn to, “What’s his CG?” or “Her CG is so high, she’ll get that internship.” People begin labeling others just by their CGPA, as if this single number can measure the entirety of someone’s worth.Yes, CGPA has its role. It opens doors for certain opportunities like internships, placements, or scholarships. But let’s not fool ourselves into believing it is the only thing that defines a person. Someone might not have a 9 or 10 CGPA but could be an exceptional leader, a brilliant innovator, a talented artist, or someone with skills that don’t show up on a grade sheet. The real world outside this campus values far more than just exam scores.When we gossip about each other’s CGPAs, we are not just comparing numbers; we are reducing people, stripping them of their individuality, and overlooking the qualities that make them unique. This culture of constant comparison creates unnecessary stress and insecurity. It pushes us into a mindset where we forget the joy of learning, the spirit of collaboration, and the beauty of personal growth.So I want to make a simple request: Please stop this constant gossiping about CGPAs. Stop judging a person by a single metric. Respect each individual for who they are, not for what their grade report says......... 
If we can learn to control this urge to compare and gossip, we will create a healthier environment — one where we motivate each other instead of pulling each other down, where we learn from each other’s strengths instead of mocking weaknesses. That’s the kind of culture that will not only help us succeed in exams or jobs but also make us better human beings.Because at the end of the day, none of us will be remembered for a CGPA. We will be remembered for how we treated others, how we grew, and what we contributed to the world.

Is this for real? I hoped the situation would change after the new director. 
Rest in Peace.

No one cares bro, students hi fun banate ha suicide ka institute kya hi kar lega

[deleted]

Now that's a big deal if the prof is involved. Should have left a note explaining everything. 
Also, just an observation in all the suicides, for once there has not been a single suicide note, seems fishy.

Wtf is happening in the campus?

this place is doomed not because of the students, but because the culture itself is eating everyone alive, people came here to breathe freedom, but all I feel is suffocation. Hope he is finally in peace!

I don't know what the solution is. We can keep blaming everyone but that is not helping anyone.

These suicides in kgp is and was never about profs or depts. It was due to us students. As someone who had dealt wd mental health problems during my time in kgp, I can assure that each and everyone is toxic here. Beware of what type of friend or groups you hang out with. Or else it'll cost your mental health (or maybe your life).

Toxicity is a disease. It spreads rapidly. So called friends , will make your life So toxic that you won't even have the hope to live further. But not everyone is toxic . There'll always be one or two guys/gals who'll make sure you take your life at some point. (Think of it as their achievement). 
If you are living in this toxic hell hole , I'd highly urge you all to cut off the toxic group of ppl. Keep in touch with your close ppl(be it a parent, brother, sister, a genuine good friend ). Pls take care 🙏.

profs need to be held accountable there is no system of feedbacks.

The sad part is no one is going to do anyting. These stories are just gonna get covered up. And in the name of suicide prevention they r gonna appoint counsellors. I don't understand why tf are they treating it this way. Instead of fixing the root causes that r there in their system they just want to avoid this problem. The whole system is full of corrupt and insane people. Everyone see us as a tool, everyone in the society. A tool that they can use in any way they like. Curse all those people. All those who don't value anyone except themselves. Whose mind is rotten to such a level that they don't even acknowledge mental health of a being.

I am not from IIT KGP. Genuinely want to know why so many deaths happen there? Like what's the root cause??

Nice

[

That's so sad. A life lost forever. May their family have the support to get through this time....

Is it true really?

Upload some pics for proof OP

Is it fake ? Cuz no news came till now ?

Is it fake or real news?

sed

fake news

I just had this thought this evening that wby hasn't a sucide happened yet....not to offend...but the thought just came....keeping in view the situations.......

[deleted]

Next sucide from SBP

Fake

The numbers are insanely high for an educational institution. The system must be reformed so that the system can provide some support for the students such that we can at least make it out alive from here. It's the barest of the bare minimum we can ask for.

But if you consider the total number of students studying here, the proportion is not large

Yes

Fr, we shouldn’t just blame the system, the profs, and what not, but focus on what we are doing to maintain a healthier environment inside the campus. Everyone should take initiative by their side to not measure and compare someone’s worth by their CG and make them feel low about it.

I don't think college wants you to compare cg , you can leave the campus with no one knowing your cg , it's on you if you disclose it, it's not always cg that takes life , the campus tried hard to never disclose other cgs in every place, so you can't blame it. Ya people judge on cgs, should stop it.

After he came frequency have increased
He just want PR 
Fucked the exam time table 
 I have 4 exam consequently 
Even on sun sat

Bhai fun banane wale ko bhi akele me serious matter lagta hoga na tumare samne fun banata hoga wo alag baat hai

[ Removed by Reddit ]

irony how profs don't give an f about our mental health but definitely give f in grades

Just stop measuring someone by how much CG does he/she has.

Real true man..

I was digging deep in Harsh's case, and it seems like there are a lot of details that need to be looked upon.

[IIT KGP: PHD scholar's suicide case | Father's statement](

Simple. People are very toxic here. They won't let you live. They'll harass you to the extent until u take your life.

I don't think it would be respectful to share images of the person who died. But an image of the corridor infront of guy's room taken from the opposite corridor is shared below.

Just come in front of BRH and you will see. I am a PhD scholar here and I have nothing to do with exams. But it's sad to see that people would think that one can spread such kind of news just to postpone exams. What have we become as a society if such a thing is normalised?

What a shameless clown you are! Why would someone want to spread such fake news to postpone exams?

[deleted]

Why are u saying like this?

You okay bro?

Hold the criminals accountable and see how fast the system changes lol

With such a large number of students, its difficult to watch everyone

What are u comparing it against?

It really hurts to see how batchmates react in such situations. If even our own peers don’t try to understand, how can we expect professors or the system to be more empathetic? People judge their friends only based on CGPA, internships, or placements, instead of supporting them as human beings.
What’s worse is that when someone struggles with depression and tries to seek help from the counselling centre or a psychiatrist, their own friends laugh and say things like, “Are you mad?” This is not what you expect from educated people. Instead of encouraging, they discourage  and that makes the person even more depressed, shy, and afraid to go to the doctor.

I'm not blaming the campus I am blaming those persons who tell themselves as frnds bt actually not.behind u they discuss

Still, even in jokes this makes all of this a generalisation. I've heard people laughing among themselves and saying ye test nhi hua to I'll kms. TF? Why do you have to joke about something so damn serious?

If it’s real then yes, but people went out to celebrate the postponing of exams last time instead of grieving the loss. So I’m not sure this time.

If it is real then most likely exams on tomorrow will get postponed to some other date because last sem also a suicide happened before end sem so they postponed the first exam to another date

Not okay bro

The criminals aren't just the people making the system, it's also equally the society that have crazy illogical expectations from IITians and then treat them as failures if they don't meet them.

an active warzone?

Its actually gen z ka dark humor. Aise hi bol dete hai woh

No man it shouldn’t happen. We have already had to change our tickets nd plans, because of the first date change.

True, it’s wayyy too much pressure, especially on teenagers

Probably yeah 😂😂

================================================================================

Title: KGP just sucks

Being the mother of all IITs what they say, we are performing too poor than our children... What's happening in this CDC process is even if your core company comes in, you are not from circuital branch or mech/chemical, you just fuck yourself... Why the administration is not at all responsible for this... Why to show we are such a good college in terms of ranking (that too due to researches going on)... No hopes for the core departments... Professors ask to work in core but sad reality is you just can't because no one really needs you... 

Ye pressure jhelna kon sikhaega? Professors ki Administration ki koi aur... Kabhi kuch badlega yahan... Bcz what I am observing is circuitals are performing same every year but other branches are just going down to 30-40%

And the effect of this can be clearly seen in this year's opening and closing ranks...

Many of the people getting placed are 4LPA ... WTF... You can even live with that in urban city...

even a proff said to the chemical freshers in the second class ki tum log bhi tech mein jaoge, core mein kuch nahi hoga

Children. It’s stupid to assume institute will help you get a job. US universities don’t have the concept of placement only. Learn to fend for yourself rather than blame it on CDC. I run a company, and was invited by CDC for placement drive. We didn’t go only. You know why? Because then it becomes a compulsion to hire someone. I would much rather not go through CDC route but let my HR team receive applications from colleges across. 

Sharpen your LinkedIn. Do real projects. Learn basics of AI. Apply it in your field because Vertical AI is a strong thesis. Please read about it. 

Your competition shouldn’t be inside the campus. Stop thinking like a rat to avoid rat race in the first place. All rats think alike and make it a rat race. Create groups. Do projects together. Launch. Fail. Repeat. Add real scars to CV. “Built XYZ and got 100 users to sign up out of which 30 converted to a paying pilot” rather than “impacted a XYZ flow by 25% in ABC company” 

Jobs are plenty….but for the right skill sets.

Imo B Techs in specialised branches (agri, Oena, Instru etc.) should not be there in the first place. IDK why they take B Tech Students for these branches. We (I am from Oena) are in such a position that core companies won't prefer us as they have options from M Tech students and we are left with no other option than SDE, Data etc. (basically na ghar ka na ghat ka wal situation)

This sucks man.

A decade back, the UG batch was 75% placed by December.

Too many bullshit branches at iit kgp. Hence too much competition among branches below ece and low placement

Damn hs 🙏🙏

I think the unnecessary lower branches r the reason for this....vai un faltu branches me agar ap job hi nahi dilwa sakte then why to open those....unko bhi agar tech me hi bhejna hai toh phir 1 hi branch kholona cs aur usi me hazaro baccho ko daldo....this is harsh reality of every indian colleges(including top iits) not just iit kgp...they just open too much branches aur niche wale branches ko na bhau milta hai na jobs.....

Being an alum, I strongly feel that the institute needs to prioritize having a well-trained and professional placecomm rather than focusing solely on balanced representation across departments and halls. My own experience with the placement committee was quite disappointing. While a few members do an excellent job, they are unfortunately in the minority.

In one instance, when our organization wanted to recruit students for highly competitive roles with a strong compensation package, our HR team struggled to even connect with the placement committee. Calls went unanswered, and timely responses were missing. Ultimately, we were allotted Day 4–5 slots despite offering a CTC of 22+ LPA, largely due to the limited number of placecomms available to handle multiple companies.

A possible solution could be to increase the size of the placement committee, ensuring that each member manages a reasonable number of students (say, not more than 50) and that they are thoroughly groomed for their responsibilities. Additionally, students themselves would benefit from structured grooming sessions. For example, the VP and GSec could arrange mock interview rounds with alumni, something that is already a well-established practice at IIMs.

I sincerely hope the new administration at KGP will address these concerns and bring positive changes.

Peace!

the intern season this year looked great

2028 is gonna be even scarier since both 2024 btech and 2023 dual degree will sit for placements

bhai aap logo ki life kitni sahi hai kabhi hum jeso ka bhi dekho bhai hum jese toh mar jane chiye apke acc

Bhai even CSE has 10% unplaced, we are seriously fucked up

I agree

If we have more students why not call more companies?

These are BTECH + Mtech merged bro Not only for Btech .

MT ka kya hua

That's why also give preference to branch too ,not Just college

Placements are not competed right?

Ec placement really disappointing

sabka yahi haal h bhai (kanpur m hu)

To fir kya iits bas cse , coding aur tech related branch hi khole ??

Yeah post every confidential document online, reduce the reputation of KGP then cry why brands aren’t coming to KGP.

OENA ke kaise h stats

Why should someone hire you if you have no skills?

Placements usually start from december know

That's the harsh truth kyunki sabko rat race main jana hai... And you are forced to get into that rat race bcz core doesn't need you.. they only need the tech peeps

Which prof? RM?

This

I agree, but still, for how hard u work to get in these institutes, feels like u deserve more than just being told "it all only depends on u, do everything urselves"

idk abt oena and agri, but in large process industries like oil & gas they intake btech instru separately than elec for process automation. Only in iits we see elec and ece combined or elec and instru combined (not kgp though). But the issue is kgp is taking more than it can digest, and there is high chance iit hyd will overtake it in the near future. Still i think the slide is showing data for both ug and pg seeing the total numbers. How can u account for 75% in mnc (2nd preferred br in kgp) if jam msc-maths also not included! Use common sense

Instrumentation is circuital

A decade back, 75% of the UG batch used to get placed by December, including those from non-circuital branches.

Those are not bullshit firstly, but the thing is if administration can't handle the branches then why to open... At least some sort of promotion or something must be done to attract

Wdym ?

Kgp has more dog ass branches

Only for circuital branches... Ask those non circuital people

Aur ai branch bhi aake niche waalon ki gaand marega

exactly and you will see these numbers going down considerably

bhai wo log research startups me gaye honge na ( i am non iitian opinion lena tha aapka)

doesn't it says ug placement? so can't be mtech or mscs

hn to bhai Btech aur Dual dono hi toh honge

This is not confidential document... This is reality

if posting the real situation in your college reduces the reputation of your college then i feel sad for you bro

Obviously ass, branch ka lauda kuch scope nahin hai

Going to Iit you are already in the rat race

Instrumentation does not exist. It is just shit made up to increase seat intake. Same for indu, there branches have no worth whatsoever and everyone goes into tech. Hence, i feel mechanical is much better since it has a core of its own

Still performing worse than mech and chem in cdc intern this yr

This has more to do with the fact that the job market is the worse it’s been in years and not much with how many branches there are

To get more fees and funding. Tujhe kya lagta hai agri ka kya lauda use hai? Waise hi bt, mining, gg bhi chutiya branches hai. Aur koi top 5 iit main cse, ai, mnc, ee, ECE nahin hai, aur idhar paachon hai, toh saare offers idhar jayenge to niche ghanta kuch nahin milega

Also, have you heard of aira gaira nathu khaira branches like instrumentation, industrial, in other good iits? We have the most branches, toh tadpenge toh niche wale hi naa

Hs has good stats then many btech branches

In kgp non circuital kabhi nahin sudhrega. Woh kharab branches hi hai

voh toh 50 bache hi hai, lekin dual wale toh laghbag 1000 bache honge

Ug Nos simply dont match. There must be some goof ups, kgp me kuch bhi ho sakta hai, check the original slide from induction prog in utube.

2year mtech aur jam-msc bhi included hai list me.

So be it, you get paid for the brand, anyone and everyone can code these days . Think from a recruiter’s perspective, you ranting online brings into spotlight something that is probably open source but not visible to the recruiters’ eyes this easily. Damaging your brand even more. Affecting/Hurting you even more. This is how the industry works.

Listen carefully. This is how the world works. You can get knowledge from anywhere. Yet only some people get paid big bucks. Everything is a brand. The more you spill the beans of what happens inside, the less attractive your iit or college becomes to the recruiter. The more you suffer. If this is the case with KGP, I pity whatever college you’re from even more.

Bhai data btado tabbhi plz.

Yeah it's very niche,I thought I would have been better as it is circuital

Oh,can you share instru,mech,chem,meta placement details bro

kuch bhi bakega? instru ka percentage intern is way higher than mech , chem!

sahi baat hai

True

 feels good to be a HS student haha

man ki baat kehdi (iit kgp mech choda tha)

Last yr it was 57%

[deleted]

But HS walo ka tech profiles mai kat ta hai

Mech is a good branch only tho

And median. Also 57% is overall of the branch strength or of  only gen cat students

uptil day 3 , 23ie: 21 people out of batch of \~45 , for 23me: 18 out of what \~90, 23ch:11 out of \~60 ,

Ik

Of overall

Median 15

Thankyou bhai sorry for bothering bas last q
Kitne log ne apply kia and kitne place hue

32 placed out of 56 regd

Can I DM you???

================================================================================

Title: Where are the People? They’re quiet and here is Why.

Apparently there’s a lot of new people in campus who doesn’t know how toxic the administration of KGP is, master’s students, Freshers and Sophomores. People aren’t quiet cause they want to be, they’re quiet cause the last time they spoke out, the institute made an example of them.

To help you understand, we’dve to backtrack a few years, to Faizan’s death, a student who was found dead in RP. Body was discovered 4 days later, and the fact is no one from the administration seemed to care, most of them barely bothered to show up. The parents were in utter disbelief, they were sure their son didn’t kill himself, unable to believe what happened, his parents came to campus, not a single person from the administration went to receive them, HCMs of multiple halls went to DOSA’s residence begging him to please communicate with the victims parents but he on the other hand threatened to impose DC on all of them if they don’t leave the place ASAP.

Forwarding a few hours, his parents met the administration, during the meeting the DOSA and other faculty treated them with utter disrespect, told them it wasn’t the institutes fault their kid was mentally ill. All this caused the student body to rise up and protest, outside the directors house until he agreed for an open house. During the open house, after a few hours of questioning, the director fainted and was hospitalised. The next morning DOSA retires, but literally no changes were made to anything (realise this is when everyone thought it was a suicide).

It would’ve still been alright had it ended there but it didn’t, parents were fighting in court for justice, so based on some baseless allegations ( a fb post, made and deleted (probably by the actual killer) which was used as proof during the case that the reason Faizan killed himself was AP which happened almost 2 years before the even) the institute shifted the whole blame on the students, that the reason faizan killed himself was ragging. Any student of the institute knows well that ragging isn’t really a thing in our institute. Eitherways, after shifting the blame, in the name of reinstating DC and ragging, the institute ruined the placements of a lot of students, placed year backs on about 10 students, stripped PORs of over 30 students, placed a lot of DCs on people and on top of all this banned around 6000 students from Participating in the GC. If all that wasn’t enough, the institute setup a special team (ARS or Anti Ragging Squad) which continually harassed students for well over 3 months, every night, barging into rooms, making issues in every hall, placing multiple DCs, hall changes, year backs and everything ruining lives of many, and the point was, I don’t think there was ever a single ragging case.

So yeah, most students don’t care any longer, it’s not because they don’t want to but cause they know what happens if they do.

Oh! And to top it all off, faizan didn’t kill himself, he was murdered, and you know what the institute never did? Apologise or take accountability for ruining soooo many lives over something that didn’t even happen.

TLDR: The admin is so toxic they’d make the life of students living hell if they tried to protest.

Just trying to shine some light on what the ARS was up to -
As you know, the weather on campus is a bit too much for most to handle. I had a single room, so I used to sleep without clothes on. One fine day, some police guy from this so called ARS bangs my door at 12:30 am. I was asleep and didn't respond. This idiot then proceeds to pry open the window to my room, rip out the curtains, and look inside with a torch. He screamed at me, following which I had to get up, get dressed, and then open the door for this idiot to "search for illegal substances" in my room, all while he was shining a torch directly on me. 
In short, the ARS was a way for the authority to rag students. Nothing good will ever happen here and I hope they shut this entire place down.

The fact that endsems are tomorrow may also be playing a part in this whole thing

The current toxic situation of the institute needs to be made public through media and petitions for reforms on change.org and so on.

The institute policy of suppressing voices and ensuring no news gets out is the main issue.

Dear students, Amit Patra here. Don't even dare to protest for an open house or academic reform, I won't let anyone tarnish my or the institute's image during my tenure. Good luck for your exams!

What are PORs?

"Faizan’s death, a student who was found dead in RP**"**.. it was LLR not RP.. 

took 4 days to discover his body is also false.. it was less than that.

So does anyone know what exactly happened in Faizan 's case?

Could you tell like what year and stream he was in?

In your story, I was getting the impression that u didn't know what happened with faizan but then at the end u did say what happened. As he was killed, the student body of the particular hall was trying to shift the blame on admins. That is missing in the story. The rest of it I agree with, the whole administration is corrupt to the root.

Does anyone know who killed faisal ??, I heard rumours that a person who did had an administrative position in college.

I agree, if they want to search for narcotics that’s a completely different issue, but basing that on someone’s suicide so that students don’t protest is just diabolical, not to mention ragging even if it does exist, is extremely rare in campus.

Kid was DR-1 of their batch and deeply loved, which usually is never the case, he even got the “Assignment Hero” title in their batch during farewell. May god bless his soul. RIP.

If you think this country is ever going to take action against such things, you’re delusional lol. Imagine if this happens in a first world country, that over 20 lives were ruined because institute wrongly accused kids because someone killed Faizan. And the actual criminal was never bought to light.

Sorry! Student from RP found dead in LLR, my bad. How long was it? It was 4 days as far as I remember.

I think manufacturing
2020 batch

What did happen with faizan actually?

Faizan? Don’t know, but if I were to bet, I’d bet it on the guy who intentionally misled the authorities. If anyone remembers who he is, feel free to call him out.

I meant in the students not raising their voice thing. Everyone is busy studying for endsems.

I am a fresher, but I am surprised at the fact the 2 unfortunate suicides that have happened this year were both rumored to be rank holders in their department, which is surprising. Is there any correlation or just coincidence?

[ Removed by Reddit ]

"Student from RP found dead in LLR",.. thanks for the clarification.

Do you remember? I came to the institute in 2022 and all I heard was that the alleged criminals were all transferred to various other IITs

Ohhh! True true maybe

Not sure about either case but hopefully no more cases🤞🤞

You want to know what would actually work?
If the person who is about to kill themself kill the responsible person too. There isn’t a single law in India that can prevent that or protect the criminal behind it and once the deaths start affecting the criminals it’d become more than a statistic to them and they’d find how to treat such issues with the importance they should be given. The only reason they don’t care is because it doesn’t affect them. Honestly, anything is better than the Indian judiciary, if you want something to happen in this country you gotta take it in your own hands

The MMM nimbu pani case? It was the victim that was transferred I guess

Whats the case? can u please give the details?.

And what is this Jugnu wala lore?

Some UG student was SAed by his TA(PG student I think) after he was drugged using nimbu pani. Happened in MMM.

Title: Bro the latest batch of kgpians (former freshers, now sophomores) need to be stopped

I have seen the subreddit grow from 1.5k to 11k in the last three years (ig due to popularization of Reddit in India) and I have never seen influx of such shit posts, not the funny kind but actual
"shit" posts.

Why the fuck do you want to ask every goddamn fucking stupid thing on here, istg if I see one more "how is X hall like" post on my feed, I will find them and personally feed them to bc Roy dogs

Talk to actual human beings you anti-social, cum guzzling, incel retards and stop using this subreddit as your personal Whatsapp group called "kgp seniors and freshers❤️☺️"

Ps: mods make a megathread or something, I am tired : (

Thank you for attending my ted talk

It's a complex problem to solve. JEE posts have given a significant amount of traction to the sub. 

We also created rules restricting these kinda posts, but then the urgency and value of these kinda posts to their OPs was considered and the posts started getting retained, turns out there were way too many posts now. 

But, your point is fair, shit posters need to be banned, a lot of them are getting banned everyday, we request people to start reporting, so that they can be removed quicker.

First it was "IIT X dep A vs IIT Y dep B" And now it's "I got X hall I don't wanna get spanked, plizz exchange". This wasn't even problematic last yr but now, everytime I open reddit these 💩 pop up

same is happening across a lot of subreddits. i am part of the comedy subreddit and now newer members are testing jokes instead of discussing the artform. this is like old times when internet got in the hands of everyone due to Jio’s pricing.

Well, the quality of posts allowed here should be kept in check. Just have a look at any foreign university's subreddit. Most, if not all, posts will be professional, using carefully thought and constructed language. They more or less stick to academic and administrative queries or opinions. That's all. I don't understand why we cannot do the same here. Here we have the countless posts asking for help with someone's JEE preparation (there are much bigger and dedicated subs for that). I have lost count of the number of times I've told people that this isn't the right sub for JEE related doubts. We have posts by frustrated individuals asking for relationship advice. Again, this isn't the right sub for that. We also have some weird posts on here, spewing some degenerate stuff that I'll never be able to comprehend. People need to learn to ask better, more mature and professional questions.

Istg I was surprised seeing this sub become active again, and an increase in the number of posts we had per month. Now, with the recent influx of freshers and sophos, what even the actual fuck is this sub. The official kgp spamming group has better content than ts

Yes these stupid posts need to go. A megathread would be good. This has truly become just a whatsapp group😭😭😭

Mods don't seem to care. I sent a modmail to become a moderator for this sub, but in vain.

i complete agree to your point. 
also want to understand one thing is LBS hall good?

I totally agree, we don't need to ask all small questions on the subreddit. My batch is just too free.

BTW how is LLR hall

Okay so finally a genuine post under the shit post label.

exactly 2 years back this subreddit has close to
1.7k and now its 11k, though its a good sign the mods need to be carefull in keeping megatreads
one for hows this branch in iitkgp type of queries next for this hall X type thing and next is how is this course for breadh elective

exactly, i dont get why do you need the reviews so much. Just accept the hall you got, and adjust with it. Everyone does it, all your previous batches did it without asking so much about the halls.

the amount of hate is crazy 💀

From another IIT, but still relate hard, istg, they should make another sub for all the gossipy sht and the main one for actual acad doubts

There's an official spamming group?

Still interested? Let's talk!

No,absolutely not. It is brutal. Without rare skills and ironclad grit, it will chew you up and spit you out. Survival isn’t a hope—it’s a battle

You were also hating on teen india having so many proposal posts. How the tables have turned huh

Dmed

yeah , i am the guy who hates teen relationship, but that hate doesnt even touch the lowest part of the words used by OP cum-guzzling like wth 💀 . the amount of hate dont compare buddy

Are you even from KGP? Thoda pdhle bachche wrna 2027 me NIT bhi nhi ayega. Any recurring user who's not a facha/Sophie would know that frequency of these 💩posts have skyrocketed. Also get some help

yes i am ab kya address dedu kya ghar ka 😭 , i mean maine campus mein bhi gya hu kaafi baar lol , and for proof aapke wahan pr jo salon hai mai whi se hmesha haircut krata tha , and wo 2 bhaiya rehte hai jo 200rs per haircut lete hai us salon mein 4 seats hai ek window ac hai aur right hand side wale waal jo ( male and female wale salon ko separate krta hai ) wahan ek hole bhi hai chota sa square shape ka . ( went into this much specifics cause i actually am from kgp and am not capping) .

Title: Natural Beauty of IIT KGP...

Title: What tf is wrong with the current student council?

5 years ago PPC (then director) was dragged to an open house and made to answer for his multiple failings after a student death. 

Last year VK Tewari was again taken to open house and was made to face the students till 4am.

In the last one year campus has undergone so many drastic changes and became so much worse, there are multiple raids on hostels everyday..food quality has been absolutely horrible, there is security everywhere and most of the campus open spaces are out of bounds for students. Atleast the last few VPs ( Devaki, Brahmjot etc) were visible all the time and always turned up whenever any student need their help. Almost everyone knew them. They also conducted the open house mostly well and had the guts to hold vk tiwari accountable. 
Where the current VP? Who is Samarth Singh? Most people don't even know what the guy looks like and haven't ever heard him speak. Why would someone become VP without having the necessary character for it? Next time PLEASE vote wisely and don't elect any random dumbfuck to the council!

The guy's from international relations cell, the same people who keep all the good interns for themselves and dish out others for rest of the community 

He had the most aggressive marketing strategy in elections, man made a whole new society (blockchain society) just to put his face on posters around campus. His whole branding was so fake too. He won only bcz of RP hall politics.

Has his dedicated group of asslickers in irc and rp who clean his ass everyday.

However, I believe the gsecs (mainly sports, tech, welfare) are extremely hardworking... socult gsecs and tech coordies are again meh

[deleted]

Although I don't think VP can be directly held responsible for this kind of incidents, he must address the student community and side with them to help raise questions to the authority, a good example would be, PPC's open house was held to point out BCRTH's clumsiness in handling the then situation. And he was grilled pretty well. 

Can someone get me in touch with the VP? Let's ask him to get into an AMA on this sub so that these kinds of questions can be clarified.

The amount of policing has increased beyond any logical sense. They won't let you sit anywhere in the open, at night, other than the 2.2. And don't get me started on the food.... sigh. This place has become a shit-hole.

this kinda situation is also happening here at IISER Bhopal, thought not this serious but a lot of stupid rules being imposed on students. the new director is just going nuts

This sounds exactly like the function of a deep state in reality.

সহমত... ওই পোলা রাজনীতি ভালো ই বোঝে... একেবারে পাক্কা নেতা.. কাজের বেলায় লব ডংকা... ভোটের আগে সে কি উন্নয়ন দেখালো বাপরে...

Title: Another day, another road rage, another prof.

Registration number - 25BH 9779C, driving in the wrong lane for an entire 200-300m, then I didn't give him enough space to drive in the wrong lane anymore. And then, just a typical indian prof personality came out - verbal attack with this exact phrase "दो कौड़ी का बाइक ले के आ जाते है", I wonder what how his good 30 lakh car gave him the right to break the traffic rules. (Please comment if you know the owner of this car, would love to know more about him). 

This is a request to everyone seeing this. Please report all the profs, who break rules, who accidentally hits someone while driving. Please realize that we have had enough. Time to give them back the taste of the medicine they have been giving to us.

Sad to know that you had to face this. His behaviour was so unbecoming of a prof, if at all he was one. Even if your following the rule caused him inconvenience, you, or for that matter anyone, don’t deserve to hear these words from a faculty. So disgraceful on his part!

Which prof? 
Profs in campus don't know how to drive.

[ Removed by Reddit ]

This car was honking from afar and drove me by very fast, I got scared.

Another professor mentioned that a few faculty members managed to obtain their driving licenses by bribing the RTO, despite not having undergone proper training

Upvoting n commenting so more ppl see

Do kaudi ki bike? Ig most of the people driving those 2 kaudi ki bikes while their bachelors can easily buy a luxury car when they will reach the profs age but idts that the prof can ever

ye gadi 30 lakh ki nahi hai bhai.

Name and shame : Shubhendu Palei

Both cyclist and car drivers are at fault. Most students are horrible cyclists, rarely using the cycle lane, no regard for road etiquette, occupying both the lanes, no respect for the security guard.... Car drivers sometimes have no choice but to honk

Chemistry department prof

WTF.. h-index of only 5 and this fellow is Assistant Professor (Grade-I) !!!!

Thanks.

Report to the control room, telling the car registration number..

Kaun samjhaaye inko. And anyways, I am more concerned about the other people who will face such incidents involving the same prof, rather than whatever he said to me. He can go f himself, for all I care. Even after all of this, as I went to click pictures of his car, I was asked for my roll number and threatened me of throwing out of this campus by that day itself. I mean, who cares !

Thank you.

Don't know where this incident happened. The bicycle lane on Shivaji Marg is not maintained. The bicycle lane is not present all around the campus.

Is this prof of chemistry dept ? Please confirm. The name would really help.

publication list vi kuch khas nehi hai

What would be a good h-index??

Cycle lane is well maintained from clock tower to Nalanda, but less than 10% cyclist use the cycle lane. Even if cycle lane is not there, aggressive cycling, earphones in ear oblivious to surroundings, overtaking from wrong side, covering entire road is all unjustifiable. In the campus, both cyclists and car drivers are problematic, cyclists are worse (marginally)
P.S. I am a cyclist

This is cheap. But we should also accept we behave as kings when cycling with friends. Can we do the same thing while driving outside?. Some of us would have been occupying entire side of right way. Though what ever he said was cheap

For basic sciences it should be 10+ (3-4 years post PhD, after 2-3 postdocs).. 

and good i-10 index too and all must be original papers, not some lousy review articles

Title: AP is back

Source: 

Is it true? And this is the response they come up with after 3 in this semester alone?

We were the last batch who had AP. I REALLY felt that AP is one of the factor for these suicides. Not having interaction with seniors, not knowing anything about your batchmates. Some of the things may be harsh and unnecessary but overall AP is for your benefit only.

what exactly is this programme?? is it ragging ? and does it bother sophies?

Right now, only the 5th-years know how the AP system works in college, and if they take it up, they might be a bit harsh about it.

they really brought back ragging to prevent more suicides 😭😭💀

Ab toh ham hi lenge 😈😈

yeh OP kab se AP hogaya

Wait, there was no O/AP until now?

[deleted]

It largely depends on that hall's 3rd yr batch

It might actually work. Can confirm it does increases bonding

It really ain’t ragging if done properly imo

well they do say that ignorance is bliss

but i heard its ragging? how are you excited for ragging?

Oh it was equally as bad for the girls

great response , aisa hi hona chahiye

AP is done to 2nd years only🙃 by 3rd years. First year is untouched

AP = Assimilation Program

Around 2019

It was discontinued for the last 2-3 years due to an unfortunate incident

Knowing each other and creating bonds are two different things. As coming from a batch which had exp last AP, we realised that with those mildly aggressive env we learnt to stay together, which developed bond and understanding, and that is more than just knowing a person. AP depends a lot on senior batches, on how they wish to take. In our case, it was regulated and was 50% aggression and 50% pure humuor. Most of us were put into punishments for the fact that we laughed at some point, at which we shouldn’t have. Overall it created some of the unforgettable memories of my college life. Here are few points i think all Halls cant have AP:
1. Hall Strength, I come from a relatively small hall strength, in which seniors did listened medical issues some of us had, and relief AP for them. Larger hall cant regulate huge batch sizes properly

2. Soft Sentiment, some people are very sensitive, and complains to admin. Before admin didnt use to take such complaints seriously but since past years these complaints are taken atmost seriously 

3. Government Guidlines

Forget AP, it will never comeback again, its new normal now

ykwhat else increases bonding?

a non tension filled orientation

Wait really? Don’t girl halls have dead culture

Wish I could see his face while he was reading this.

I heard Faizan was a homicide case.

Never believed that rumor. He died during the later months of the semester. AP was over way before that. Institute aunthorities just trying to point the blame on something.

Title: Anda eaters of KGP, what is this behaviour

We really need a compulsory course on civic sense. Gender sensitization chhodo, pehle in logo ko civic sense sikhao. From basic things like flushing the toilet, throwing garbage not in dustbins, walking on the road instead of a perfectly fine sidewalk to this. More than half the campus would be considered illiterate for an outsider coming to visit.

Arrrey top minds of the country...kuch bhi karo chalega na.

its worse in my hall non vegetarians leave bones of fish nd chicken on dinning table, mfs didn't bother about other people

No civic sense.

they’re illiterate people with a jee rank 👎🏼

Same here at iitd

Really. We have to go forward towards responsible behaviour.

Need a course on Civic Sense also.

You’re allowed to leave the eggshell as it is only if you come out of it

IIT-IIT jitna bhi karo hai toh Indian hai bhaisaheb.

Bhai I've seen one thing; you have to go against the flow of common sense to have civic sense in India. Tujhe dusro ko dekhna padega roj and think that wo kuch v kare, me khudko maintain karunga and only then you can be civil. Nahi toh it's actually easier to go with the flow and do shit like this.

Title: Nothing screams ‘poor education’ like setting fire to shared property

Bruh, where tf is people’s civic sense these days? 🤦‍♂️ Like seriously, how do you even grow up thinking it’s funny or cool to damage common property? Some geniuses in the hall actually went and burst crackers inside dustbins (yes, you read that right — dustbins) and around the corridors.

Now everything stinks of burnt plastic, bins are half-melted, and who’s gonna deal with the mess? The cleaning staff. Not the morons who thought they were re-enacting Diwali meets Call of Duty.

This isn’t just childish it’s straight-up dumb. Signs of poor upbringing and zero education. You don’t just lack respect for rules; you lack basic respect for shared spaces and the people who maintain them. Imagine being 20+ years old and still acting like a 12-year-old with fireworks.

It’s not “fun”, it’s not “tradition”, it’s just vandalism. And the worst part? Everyone else living here has to deal with the damage. Smh.

trash peeps

Education and schooling are very different tbh...this is after top tier schooling but poor education 🌚

Just passing exams don't make you educated bro. Thoda civic sense develop krle. Mutual respect, shared values bhi thoda seekhle agar abhitak sikhne ka mauka nahi mila hai to.

Old IITs have the worst kind of vandalism man. I came to KGP for inter IIT back in the day, and there were these graffitis on the hall walls and room doors. My hypothesis is, it got worse* as you climbed up the floors, because I was allocated the top most floor IIRC. 

Here in Delhi, in the old hostels, people have written all kinds of abuses and perhaps even drawn pen!ses (can't say for sure, since I shifted to a new hostel a few months back), not only on the dorm walls but inside washrooms as well. 

Washrooms near the PG rooms are still better, but the ones near UG rooms are in hellish conditions. 

People really don't have any sense! I think the only old IIT I didn't see being so much vandalized was Bombay.

Bhai ye log literal pro-level dumb aur uncivilized nikle 😭 Dustbin mein cracker?? 💀 Education aur upbringing dono left the chat. IIT ho ya ITI, civic sense thoda to rakh lo yaar. Chu\*iye log — ghar mein jo seekhenge wahi nikalta hai. Inko bhi expel karo, simple, u dont deserve it bro, really.

Sorry bhai, vandalism is fun though you should try it sometime though in limit

Chalo, kisi ko to dimag hai. Sahi bola hai. 

We used to do shit with bombs but on disposable items like cold drink cans or small metal pipes. The maximum we did was with a steel glass from mess, just to see the maximum height due to initial thrust.

I think writing abuses on the wall is not much of problem. But bursting crackers on dustbin is definitely is.

Sad part is, the rest of us have to pay the price for their stunts

Pa-

What's with this casual racism, which would conviniently disguise as a casual "joke"?

Mere time mein to gen wale zyada karte the iye harkate

Pagal ho gye h bhai sab or they were like this from the start.

Imagine someone burn down your house and say "Vandalism is fun". Vandalism is never done in limit.

It's all up to your tolerance. Ghar ki kheti nahi hai ki pen!ses banana and writing abuses becomes okay. Defacing any property like this is a problem, be it via graffitis or by bursting crackers inside dustbins.

Title: One of the most irrelevant course here

Even today, the best architects & core engineer create drawings to effectively present their ideas to clients. This is where engineering drawing plays a crucial role. If you doubt this, just look up any best architect or core engineer. I used to dislike this subject, but my perspective changed when I saw some architects explaining concepts using simple hand-drawn sketches of small house structures. I was amazed at how these hand drawings surpassed even CAD in clarity and simplicity.

i took ED in school so was really good at it. Easily helped 5 folks pass the exam

the audacity to put this course for a lbs 5th floor 1st yr at 2pm on a Wednesday. damn it the real struggle is to find out where S301 and S302 is

The reason behind teaching ED is not to give you guys trauma, it's literally a failsafe for CAD in event of a nuclear fallout.

4 hours standing straight

Trauma, Pain , agony, suffering. This course gave it all.

God knows how i passed this exam. Taking all the required stationary and preserving drawing sheet from wrinkles itself was a trauma. Exam main cheating bhi nahi kar sakte

The most relevant one!!

It is funny how techbros extoll Ayn Rand and shit on Engineering drawings all the same.

My ex girlfriend used to have the afternoon off when i had cad, and she dropped by and did all the drawings for me.

Still couldn't manage more than a B iirc

2016 mein also same tha

Looks like a coder has made this post.
Engineering Drawing is essential in order to understand perspectives.
One cannot develop games like PUBG if they don't have any knowledge of Isometric projections.
No subject in engineering is useless, you're an engineer you must have enough knowledge to tackle any challenges faced by society!

I'm getting into ID and have to learn this now. Regret not paying any attention to this in the first year.

Course itself isn't hard..even I helped another guy to pass the exam...The thing is there are thousand better things to learn than this

We were taught Manual drawing which is irrelevant in present day for 8 or 9 weeks but CAD just for 3 classes...truly sad for a institute that should be the flag bearer for the country

That building is the OG backroom

i still can't find these rooms even though i have stayed at kgp for 2 years now

Subtle flex

Well this is one of them subjects which is easy to pickup

See, the thing is, cad isn’t really that hard to pick up and get on with when you’re well versed in the fundamentals of manual drawing. Also, the kind of cad they’re teaching here is used mostly in civil and mech, and is explored more in detail in the core curricula of those fields. Branches like elec and electronics use different kinds of simulation softwares, like spice, Simulink and kicad. Even I hated this course, but you ought to understand that the manual part actually helps people get better at cad. And although it is not industrially used today, manual drawing is still pretty relevant. You also ought to understand that industrial relevance is not the only kind of relevance. I often get frustrated with people calling older techniques ‘irrelevant’ just because there are newer and more automated versions of things. People have built magnificent structures using these ‘irrelevant’ technologies long before computers even existed. Just because automation exists, doesn’t mean that we should ignore older things altogether. Engineering isn’t just about the industry or the work or the pay, it’s also about analysing how we have evolved and progressed as a species, based on the things we have created…

Vaha pe night main 
Andhera ho jaata 😁

I once tried a creepy thing in my room, and lets just say it turned out not how I expected.

At 3:03 AM, I took a mirror, hung it on the wall, lit a candle and chanted “Bloody mary” 3 times. I heard some movement in my room, but nothing else happened. I got a little terrified but wanted to see more, so I chanted again “Bloody mary” 3 times. And all of a sudden I heard a voice, a loud one saying “So ja bsdk”. It was my roommate, I forgot they were in my room

The pfp on iitKgp's sub reddit is unsymmetrical

An economics professor is rape accused currently on bail

There is a secret room at the backside of the Nehru Museum of science and technology, and obviously it's locked all the time except once a girl manages to get in there, by taking the keys from a guard somehow. That girl was a psycho, and she was successful in manipulating a guy when she first met him. She asked the guy "if you kiss me you'll never see me again and if you won't we'll continue meeting". Guess what he answered."No", one day she called him to meet at a night canteen at 2 am and they both witnessed sunrise that day at the lakeside of gymkhana. And it was peak time, midsems were going on and these two were not worried. The next day I mean the next night she called him to meet beside TOAT (most silent area perfect for couples to hang out) at 11.30. He went for her through the main building to the backside of TOAT lingering through the shadows and he realised he was not alone there were other people just like him hanging out there. in excitement he asked " why did you want to meet me here?" Then she grabbed his hand and started walking. " Where exactly are we going?" He asked."Just walk," she replied, a playful glint in her eyes. They reached Nehru Museum, and she led him to the back gate. At the very end stood a locked door. She turned to him with a smirk."Let me show you some magic." She asked. She pulled a bunch of keys from her pocket and then She opened the door. The guy was shocked and it's pretty obvious why she had a key of a room that none of the students use. A mix of fear and curiosity stirred in the boy's heart."Don't worry, just come," she said, stepping in. Then, she shut the door behind them. In the dim glow of our phone flashlights, they saw a narrow vertical tunnel-like structure with an iron staircase leading upwards."Can we go somewhere else?" He asked. "Trust me. You're going to love this," she assured. With no other choice he followed her upwards, and they reached the top.The view from that height was breathtaking, an ethereal blend of solitude and serenity.
They sat there for nearly two hours talking to each other.
The boy was in fear as well as in joy , he was not able to handle his fear so he asked " should we leave now? it's too late and we have exams Tomorrow". She started looking at the boy without a single blink of her eyes.
"Why are you looking at me like that?" he asked
"You can kiss me if you want. But just once. And after that… we will never meet again." She replied.
And suddenly a pigeon snapped out of a window and flew away like nothing happened.
And guess what happened...

mereko toh jail fetish hai, kisi aur ko hai kya?

Because you are idiots... during our time LAN was under our control, content in DC was under our control, blocking of websites was unheard of.. we even had categorized bhajan channels running 24/7

Coming to physical restrictions.. in SN/IG, they tried to impose curfew from 11 PM to 4 AM... girls protested and they even spent a night sleeping on scholars avenue & gol B.. within 2 days, admins came down and lifted that 11-4 curfew..

bc jaa dsa kar

Kaunse jail me rakha hain tumko bhai

Some people think that staying in small rooms is a way to have a successful life. Bematlab ka struggle na ho to success to milta hi nhi

Arre toh ek jail cell mein ek prisoner thri rehta tha lmao

So you'd drop the soap purposefully?

Tell me you are from UP Bihar without telling me..

Hein ji ?

In which year had the protest happened?

Just things people say to cope with their struggle

2003 or 2004...around that DPS MMS incident time

I see, thanks
