1q1z38c,"""They're coming""...","Heyy, my name's Ann and I moved into my current house a few months ago. Maybe two, maybe three. I don't know.",22,0
1q1z38c,,I inherited this house after my mom passed away. But strange stuff's been happening.,14,1
1q1z38c,,"At first, I thought it was just the usual adjustment stress- the new job, new city, sleep deprivation. You know, the usual. But then the nightmares started.",27,2
1q1z38c,,For a week I had the same nightmare. In this dream I'd wake up.. I'd get out of bed half asleep to get a glass of water.,27,3
1q1z38c,,"When I get to the kitchen, I'd stop dead in my tracks- noticing this guy in my kitchen.",18,4
1q1z38c,,"A guy I've never seen before, yet he'd be standing in my kitchen like he owns the place, with his back towards me.",23,5
1q1z38c,,"I'd approach him, asking him who he was. He'd always turn around and look at me. Staring at me with those pitch black eyes.",24,6
1q1z38c,,"I'd wake up drenched in sweat, gasping for air. Again, I wrote it off as stress. God, how I wish it were only that...",24,7
1q1z38c,,Life went on and the nightmares eventually stopped bothering me. I had other things to worry about.,17,8
1q1z38c,,"My job was putting a *​*lot of pressure on me and eventually, after quite some time, I got a day off.",21,9
1q1z38c,,"I took this as an opportunity to do a little cleaning. I went up to the attic. I sneezed like 100 times due to the dust, lol.",27,10
1q1z38c,,"I got to cleaning and that's when I noticed these boxes, tucked away in a corner. Curiosity got the better of me.",22,11
1q1z38c,,"I picked up the boxes and took them downstairs to the lounge. I sat down and looked at the box. It was labelled ""Mom's old stuff"".",26,12
1q1z38c,,"It was in my handwriting. Well, that's strange cuz I don't remember writing *​*that. But maybe I did; maybe I just forgot. Right?",23,13
1q1z38c,,"Anyways, I went through the contents and at the bottom of the box I found letters. It was addressed to me. I opened the first one.",26,14
1q1z38c,,"It read: ""*You'll see him soon*"". I laughed. I actually laughed. It must've been my older brother who's messing with me. I didn't bother reading the rest.",27,15
1q1z38c,,"Instead, I put the box back where it came from and went on with my day. I really should've seen the signs.. Last night I woke up at 2:37 a.m.",30,16
1q1z38c,,Not because of the nightmares. No. I woke up cuz I heard my bedroom door creaking. I swear to god that it was locked.,24,17
1q1z38c,,"I looked out into the hallway, which was way darker than it should've been. I heard a sound. I wrote it off as the house settling.",26,18
1q1z38c,,"But I heard it again, clearer this time. It was a voice, my voice, whispering: ""*They're coming*"". Ok, so at this point I was like ""*what the fuck?""*.",28,19
1q1z38c,,"Cuz who's coming? And why did I just hear my own voice? Nothing was making sense anymore. But I was too tired, so I just went back to sleep.",29,20
1q1z38c,,"This morning when I woke up, my front door was open. It was locked last night. It's 11 p.m right now and I'm typing this from my boyfriend's house.",29,21
1q1z38c,,"I should feel safe but to be honest, I don't. I think... I think it followed me. Cuz 5 minutes ago I awoke to someone whispering: ""*I'm here*""",28,22
1q1usyd,I Often Dream of Trains,"I often dream of trains. Actually, I *always* dream of trains. Every time I sleep. At night or even during a quick nap, I dream of an unending railway journey.",30,0
1q1usyd,,"I’ve had this reoccurring dream for so long that I can’t remember where I’m going, or even where I started.",20,1
1q1usyd,,"Three nights ago, I dreamt I was in a buffet car, planning to transfer to the Kensbruck line at a stop named Roundings. Roundings wasn’t my ultimate destination.",28,2
1q1usyd,,Roundings was just a way-point. A place where I would transfer to another train which would bring me closer to my final stop.,23,3
1q1usyd,,"I was sitting at a buffet-car table, gently holding an empty, coffee-stained paper cup so that it wouldn’t slide off the Formica surface when the train decelerated.",27,4
1q1usyd,,"The conductor stood in front of me, feet shoulder-width apart, swaying gently in opposition to the rocking of the train.",20,5
1q1usyd,,"“Unfortunately,” the dream-conductor explained to me, “when you bought your ticket, you didn't account for the every-third-Tuesday line restriction. I’m sorry to say this train won't stop at Roundings.",29,6
1q1usyd,,"But not to worry. You can disembark at Abingwell and exchange your ticket for an express on the Southway line, then transfer back to the Kensbruck line at Dawson.",29,7
1q1usyd,,"Might even save you time in the end.”

It’s always like this.",12,8
1q1usyd,,"In every dream, I’m on the wrong train, or I’m going the wrong way, or there’s some obscure reason why I can’t get off at the stop I planned to.",30,9
1q1usyd,,Third-Tuesday line restrictions. Seasonal rail schedules. Limited-express transfer tickets. There’s always some damn thing that prevents me from getting where I need to go. Wherever that is.,27,10
1q1usyd,,"These waypoints, the transfer stations like Roundings and Abingwell, don’t exist. Sure, you might find a town or village named Roundings or Abingwell somewhere in the real world.",28,11
1q1usyd,,But the real-world places that happen to share the names of places I dream of have no connection with each other.,21,12
1q1usyd,,"Roundings and Abingwell are linked by train in my dreams. In the real world, if there are any places with these names, they have nothing to do with one another.",30,13
1q1usyd,,"For the remainder of my fitful sleep that evening, my dream-self obediently did what the conductor told me to do.",20,14
1q1usyd,,"I stayed on the train as it rolled through Roundings without stopping. I disembarked at Abingwell, like he told me to do. I woke up.",25,15
1q1usyd,,The next night my endless dream continued like it was a TV show I had paused during my waking hours and restarted once I became unconscious.,26,16
1q1usyd,,"My dream episode started on the platform at Abingwell, arguing with the clerk at the ticket window.",17,17
1q1usyd,,Behind me fumed a line of a dozen prospective train travelers who each urgently needed to speak with the clerk.,20,18
1q1usyd,,"The customers behind me took turns glaring at me, sighing loudly, and checking their watches with exaggerated, frustrated gestures.",19,19
1q1usyd,,"A man wearing an enormous backpack was stuck at the end of the queue which I was, apparently, solely responsible for.",21,20
1q1usyd,,"Backpack man verbalized the travelers’ mood with a series of stage-whispered remarks. “Really? Come *on*! Let’s *go*! …”

I continued to monopolize the small station’s sole ticket window.",28,21
1q1usyd,,"“I was *told* that I could get to Kensbruck from here,” I plead with the ticketing clerk.",17,22
1q1usyd,,"Behind me, from the track, came a shouted “all aboard” followed by the sounds of a train slowly accelerating out of the station.",23,23
1q1usyd,,"I hoped that wasn’t the train I was supposed to be on. ""Of course, you can,” the clerk replied.",19,24
1q1usyd,,"“But...” she paused and looked at me over the tops of her glasses, “you cannot get there from the next train.",21,25
1q1usyd,,"The next train is an Express-Limited which skips the transfer stop at Dawson. You want the Express-Full, which doesn’t stop here until 5:00.",23,26
1q1usyd,,"At that time, the station at Dawson will already be closed due to the reduced summer hours.""

""So now what do I do?""

“I can issue a voucher for a discount non-re-entry return on this line.",36,27
1q1usyd,,"You'll re-board the 8673 when it stops at Barnsworth, cross the platform and return to Roundings on the 8674.",19,28
1q1usyd,,"You’ll arrive there just after midnight, so the Tuesday restrictions will have lifted.” I woke up.",16,29
1q1usyd,,In the next dream something else has gone wrong with my plan to disembark at Barnsworth.,16,30
1q1usyd,,"And, of course, there is no return to Roundings for another day and a half.",15,31
1q1usyd,,"Of course, after giving me the bad news that I cannot return to Roundings as planned, the conductor on this night’s dream train tells me how I can correct this.",30,32
1q1usyd,,"Before I woke, I ended up on another train, heading in the wrong direction with a scheme to transfer again to a train that will get me to the train that was the one to correct the problem from the previous dream.",42,33
1q1usyd,,The trains always run on-time. They never break down and are never delayed.,13,34
1q1usyd,,"Indeed, if there is anything about my dreams that distinguishes them from reality, it is that the railway functions flawlessly. The problem is with my ticket.",26,35
1q1usyd,,It’s like I’ve found a flaw in my dreamland’s miraculously complex rail schedule.,13,36
1q1usyd,,"Despite the extent of the rail network, and hundreds or maybe even thousands of trains that ride those rails, there’s no way to travel from my long-forgotten origin to my mysterious destination.",32,37
1q1usyd,,The train schedules just don’t line up. It’s impossible to get to where I’m going from where I started. I've had these dreams for years.,25,38
1q1usyd,,"Every time I sleep, I board a different train in an attempt to correct whatever problem happened in the previous dream.",21,39
1q1usyd,,Night after night I get farther and farther from my forgotten destination. I'm not the only person who experiences part of the same endless dream every time they sleep.,29,40
1q1usyd,,"From the age of 12, until his death at 85, every time he slept, a man from Illinois dreamt he was locked in a forgotten prison cell.",27,41
1q1usyd,,"A woman from Seattle reported dreaming of practicing piano every night for forty years. In each dream, she struggled to learn a different part of the same piano concerto.",29,42
1q1usyd,,"A concerto that, if played all the way through, would last centuries. The medical journals report a handful of other, similar cases. There’s a name for this sleep disorder: Somnocontinuum.",30,43
1q1usyd,,"As far as chronic medical conditions go, somnocontinuum isn’t that bad. My sleep-specialist reassured me that it has no effect on my lifespan and no increased risk of co-morbidities.",29,44
1q1usyd,,"She pointed out that since I have no problem falling asleep, and I wake up feeling rested, it’s considered a mild sleep disorder – one that’s not even worth medicating.",30,45
1q1usyd,,Perhaps the only significant impact of my disorder is that I am afraid to travel by train.,17,46
1q1usyd,,"When I’ve needed to travel, for work or to visit family, I’ve always managed to find a way to get where I need to go without boarding a train.",29,47
1q1usyd,,I'm happy to fly. Airlines’ hub and spoke systems are too simple to hide a bizarre scheduling trap like the one my dream-self is stuck in.,26,48
1q1usyd,,Buses don’t cause me any anxiety. Taxis are expensive but otherwise feel safe to me.,15,49
1q1usyd,,"Eventually, though, I had to face my fear of being indefinitely stranded in a transit system.",16,50
1q1usyd,,"Two weeks ago, I was asked to make an important work trip to my firm’s satellite office in Redding.",19,51
1q1usyd,,"Flying there wasn’t an option, since I would necessarily land at an airport that was as far from Redding as our home office.",23,52
1q1usyd,,"The bus was too slow and would require an overnight stop. The firm couldn’t afford a private car and, I discovered, after checking prices myself, neither could I.",28,53
1q1usyd,,"I suppose I could have refused the assignment. But this was a new account, and our potential new client asked for me, specifically.",23,54
1q1usyd,,I am loyal to my firm and I have the ambition of one day joining the executive suite.,18,55
1q1usyd,,"I knew that no matter how carefully I described my phobia – no, my *medical condition* – all my colleagues would hear is that I refused the assignment because of a scary dream.",33,56
1q1usyd,,"I convinced myself that I was being childish. I needed to face my fear. Besides, I told myself, I’ll be traveling in the real world, not in a surreal dreamscape.",30,57
1q1usyd,,"If anything goes wrong, I reasoned, I’ll just get off the train, get a taxi into town, and figure out what to do from there.",25,58
1q1usyd,,"In my dream journey, the option to just get off the train and leave the station never occurs to me.",20,59
1q1usyd,,"I spent three hours booking my ticket, scrutinizing the schedule and fine-print to make sure there were no hidden glitches with the ticket.",23,60
1q1usyd,,An express train that doesn't stop where I need it to. An every-third-Tuesday schedule that throws a wrench in the whole itinerary. I saw no problems.,26,61
1q1usyd,,"I told myself I was just letting my overactive imagination get to me, then I clicked the “Purchase Ticket” button. I live in an outer suburb.",26,62
1q1usyd,,The train station is only a few stops from the end of its line and is not very busy.,19,63
1q1usyd,,"I arrived early and sat on the bench on the empty platform. I scanned my ticket again, looking for signs of trouble.",22,64
1q1usyd,,"I was to board the 11:29 local, transfer to the Northworks line at Rodingham (which are real places, unlike the fictional waypoints in my dream), and ride six more stops to Redding.",32,65
1q1usyd,,"The ticket was nearly as straightforward as possible. Board one train, transfer to another, get off. I put the ticket back in my pocket and looked around.",27,66
1q1usyd,,"A man stood on the far end of the platform, facing me.",12,67
1q1usyd,,"Was he staring at me or just looking down the tracks, waiting for the train to round the corner?",19,68
1q1usyd,,"I squinted to bring the opposite end of the platform into better focus. He was formally dressed, wearing a black suit and tie.",23,69
1q1usyd,,"However, in a jarring clash of styles, he also wore an enormous red backpack – the kind of pack you’d wear if you were setting out on a long, multi-day hike through the wilderness.",34,70
1q1usyd,,The clatter of the arriving train sounded from behind me.,10,71
1q1usyd,,"I turned around and saw the locomotive round the bend – a tall, rectangular machine painted in the smart navy blue and sunflower yellow livery of the railway line.",29,72
1q1usyd,,Behind it a dozen passenger cars slid into view. The summer sun was shining. The train proudly sounded its whistle.,20,73
1q1usyd,,The scene was a postcard-perfect image of a train approaching a remote station. Norman Rockwell couldn’t have done a better job composing the iconic scene.,25,74
1q1usyd,,I looked at my watch – 11:27 am. The train was running perfectly on time – just like in my dreams. The train squealed and hissed to a stop.,29,75
1q1usyd,,The doors opened with a quieter and lower-pitched pitched hiss. I glanced down the platform. The man at the far end was staring in my direction.,26,76
1q1usyd,,"I walked to the nearest open door, then paused before stepping inside. The man at the far end of the platform also walked to the door nearest him and paused.",30,77
1q1usyd,,I took a deep breath and stepped into the train. The man in the suit and backpack did the same.,20,78
1q1usyd,,"My car was nearly empty – two or three other passengers sat alone, separated by four or five rows of seats.",21,79
1q1usyd,,"I took a seat in an unoccupied row in the middle of the car. Outside the window, the little train station slid backwards as the train gently accelerated forward.",29,80
1q1usyd,,The train reached its final speed.,6,81
1q1usyd,,The acceleration that pushed me into my seat was replaced by a gentle rocking and swaying that was pleasantly synchronized with the clacking of the wheels on the tracks.,29,82
1q1usyd,,"Despite my extensive experience with trains and sleep, I had forgotten how relaxing the rolling-on-rails part of train travel can be.",21,83
1q1usyd,,"The train gently rounded a turn, and the sunlight shifted a few degrees, bathing my face in light. I closed my eyes to avoid the glare. I woke up.",29,84
1q1usyd,,The train was still moving. I struggled with confusion for a moment.,12,85
1q1usyd,,"For as long as I can remember, the experience of being on a train meant that I’ve fallen asleep. That I’m *still* asleep.",23,86
1q1usyd,,I had to reason about what was going on – *I’m not dreaming. I’m actually on a train. I’m awake*. The slumber I had awoken from was dreamless.,28,87
1q1usyd,,"For the first time in decades, I slept peacefully, without dreaming of trains.",13,88
1q1usyd,,The window framed a picture of winter beauty – the train rode along the shore of a massive frozen lake.,20,89
1q1usyd,,"A dense forest of pine trees, bent low from a foot-deep load of accumulated snow, stood between the tracks and the lake.",22,90
1q1usyd,,"On the far shore, tall, snowy hills rose sharply from the water. I shot to my feet, motivated by a primitive and pointless urge to run.",26,91
1q1usyd,,The gesture was useless – the summer had turned to winter overnight. How does one run from the incoherent flow of time?,22,92
1q1usyd,,"“The lake is beautiful, am I right?”

I spun around aggressively. My lizard brain was still firing “something is wrong” signals into the rest of my mind.",27,93
1q1usyd,,Signals being blasted at a volume of eleven on a scale of one to ten. The speaker was the man who boarded the train with me.,26,94
1q1usyd,,He was older than I had imagined when he was a small man-shaped blur at the far end of the platform. Mid fifties? A well-preserved sixty?,26,95
1q1usyd,,"He was, unmistakably, the same man – he wore a black suit and tie. He was sitting in the seat directly across the aisle from mine.",26,96
1q1usyd,,"His huge red backpack sat on the seat next to him. “No! It’s not!” Hey, give me credit for at-least putting a few words together.",25,97
1q1usyd,,"“You don’t think so?” His calm reply somehow made me more agitated. “Why, then, did you take us here?” He studied me with unblinking eyes.",25,98
1q1usyd,,"Looking for meaning in my expression, in the pattern of my breath, in my panicked eyes. “I’m just a passenger.",20,99
1q1usyd,,"I’m trying to get to Redding.” Then I started a half dozen sentences that I never finished. “Where - . No, What -.",23,100
1q1usyd,,"I need to know -….” Finally, I just pointed out the window.",12,101
1q1usyd,,"“You want to know where this train is going?”

He waited patiently for my breathing to slow enough to form a reply.",22,102
1q1usyd,,"“Yes, please tell me where we are going.”

“I will tell you exactly where we are going. In fact, I can’t *wait* to tell you where we are going.",29,103
1q1usyd,,"But first, I want to tell you about my medical condition.” He gestured for me sit. I sat. “I was hit by a train,” he said.",26,104
1q1usyd,,He unzipped the main compartment of his huge red backpack. It was filled with protein bars and energy drinks.,19,105
1q1usyd,,"He pulled out a chocolate protein bar and offered it to me. I absently took it and put it in my pocket. “Hit by a train,” he continued.",28,106
1q1usyd,,"“A fully loaded taconite drag out of Gladstone. A hundred fifty hoppers, easily. Two Dash-9s pulling and three pushing. These were Canadian National locomotives.",24,107
1q1usyd,,"DC-traction units.”

I had no idea what he was talking about. Taconite? Dash-9s? DC-traction units? He either didn’t realize I had no idea what this meant or he didn’t care.",30,108
1q1usyd,,He kept on with his story. “My accident happened at a grade crossing. Just outside of Hendricks.,17,109
1q1usyd,,"That’s a section of high-speed track so the train was probably going sixty, maybe seventy miles an hour.” He pulled an energy drink from his pack and cracked it open.",30,110
1q1usyd,,"“God, it was a beautiful train. The locomotives were freshly painted. Bright red and shiny black. I was racing it to the crossing. Thought I could beat it.",28,111
1q1usyd,,"But that big, beautiful locomotive snagged my truck and dragged me a quarter mile. That’s what they told me anyway. That was on June tenth, nineteen eighty-four.",27,112
1q1usyd,,"I woke from the coma on July twenty fifth.”

He took a large gulp from his energy drink, and studied the can for a moment. “That’s when the dreams started.",30,113
1q1usyd,,Dream – singular – actually. The same damn dream every night – every time I sleep – like a new episode of the stupidest TV show you can imagine.,29,114
1q1usyd,,"They said I had somnocontiuum caused by traumatic brain injury.” He pronounced somnocontinuum carefully, as if I had never heard the term before.",23,115
1q1usyd,,“You also dream of trains?” I couldn’t believe I met someone else who not only suffered from somnocontinuum but had a continuous dream that pertained to trains. “Not trains.,29,116
1q1usyd,,"Not exactly.” He grinned like he was telling an inside joke, and I wasn’t in on it.",17,117
1q1usyd,,"“Every time I fall asleep, I dream about *you*.”

 

**\* \* \***

 

I rode the train through three stops. Each tiny one-room station served a minor town or outlying village.",30,118
1q1usyd,,A few passengers disembarked at each stop. Nobody boarded. Mister brain-damage-with-the-backpack hadn’t followed me when I stormed away from him. Somnocontinuum with me as the dream focus? Crazy. And impossible.,30,119
1q1usyd,,How could our dreams be linked? I felt the train start to slow again – another stop coming up. The vestibule door hissed open behind me.,26,120
1q1usyd,,"I turned around, expecting to see backpack man lurching towards me. But it was only the conductor, dragging a wake of winter air from the vestibule with him.",28,121
1q1usyd,,"“Basingstoke!” he shouted. “Next stop is Basingstoke.”

“Excuse me,” I asked. “What’s after Basingstoke?”

“Next after Basingstoke?",17,122
1q1usyd,,"The train will continue to points west.” He continued his march through the car, disappearing through the forward door a moment later. *Points west*. West of *what*?",27,123
1q1usyd,,What does *points* mean? Cities? Nowheresville stops like the last three? Where was I going?,15,124
1q1usyd,,I shifted in my seat to face the window again and felt something in my pocket – the protein bar that backpack-man gave me.,24,125
1q1usyd,,"He said he knew where we were going. I rolled my eyes, passing judgment on my own plan even as I started to put it into action.",27,126
1q1usyd,,"I walked back to the door the conductor had just come through, moved quickly though the cold and windy vestibule between cars, and into the next car.",27,127
1q1usyd,,Backpack man was still there. Still sipping his energy drink.,10,128
1q1usyd,,"“Well, if it isn’t the man of my –”

“What do you mean, you dream of me?”

He took another healthy swig from his energy drink.",26,129
1q1usyd,,"“I dream of *you* being on a train. *You* are always *you*. Always stupid *you*. But in every dream, *I’m* a different person.",23,130
1q1usyd,,"Maybe I’m working in the buffet car, listening to the conductor explain to you that the train you’re on doesn’t stop where you thought it did.",26,131
1q1usyd,,"Maybe I’m behind you line at the ticket counter, listening to you whining about being lost and confused, trying to get a new ticket to go back to where you made the previous dream’s mistake.",35,132
1q1usyd,,"Or I’m a passenger, watching you lurch around the train, asking why it didn’t stop where you wanted to get off.",21,133
1q1usyd,,"No offence, but you have got to be the dumbest railway passenger in the history of trains.",17,134
1q1usyd,,"In the history of travel, maybe.”

“Look, Its not my fault that I’m lost.",14,135
1q1usyd,,"In my dreams, the train schedule is impossible to unders-“

“The worst part,” he interrupted, “is that you don’t even know where you’re going.”

I stopped trying to defend my dream-self’s decision-making.",32,136
1q1usyd,,"“Where am I going? I’ve forgotten. Or maybe I never knew.”

He smiled. “Your ultimate destination?”

“Yes.”

“The place your dream-self booked a ticket to travel to?”

“Dammit, yes!",29,137
1q1usyd,,"Where?”

“You, my fellow dreamer, are trying to get to paradise.”

I had spent three and a half decades wondering where my dream self was traveling to, yet I was completely unprepared for his answer.",35,138
1q1usyd,,My mind raced. *I’ve died and this is the afterlife. Maybe I really* am *going to paradise – won’t that be great? I didn’t pack for this weather.,28,139
1q1usyd,,This guy is trying to scam me. It looks cold out there. Maybe I’ll just go back to sleep.,19,140
1q1usyd,,I should get off this train.* The ideas were in no particular order – drops of thought that hit my cortex like rain hitting a windshield.,26,141
1q1usyd,,"“I should get off this train,” I was just verbalizing the last thought to go through my mind.",18,142
1q1usyd,,But hearing my own voice state the idea somehow made it feel like a deliberate decision. I turned around and walked towards the vestibule.,24,143
1q1usyd,,"“I’m getting off this train.”

 “Woah there, You can’t. It’s prohibited.”

 “I’m getting off this train. At the next stop.” I punched the vestibule door button and it slid open.",30,144
1q1usyd,,Track noise and winter air overwhelmed the warmth and gentle clacking of the car.,14,145
1q1usyd,,“You have a lovely mid-century modern dining room set.” He shouted at me to make sure I heard him over the track noise.,23,146
1q1usyd,,"“The Ansel Adams print is a little cliché, though!”

The vestibule door slid shut. I stared at him through the door’s narrow, rectangular window. He smirked back at me.",29,147
1q1usyd,,He had me at a disadvantage. He *knew* things. About me. About my dream journey. About my real-world apartment.,19,148
1q1usyd,,I pushed the door button and stepped back into the car when it slid open. “How do you know what’s in my apartment?,23,149
1q1usyd,,"Are you spying on me?”

“Four days ago, my dreams of you suddenly changed.",14,150
1q1usyd,,"I fell asleep and for once, thank *God*, you weren’t on a train or at a train station! For once, you weren’t a stupid, bumbling, and clueless traveler.",28,151
1q1usyd,,You were *awake*. Sitting at a lovely rosewood dining table. You’ve got an Ansel Adam’s Half Dome print on the far wall.,22,152
1q1usyd,,"You had a laptop in front of you and you were buying a train ticket to Redding. So I bought the same ticket.”

I stepped back into the car.",29,153
1q1usyd,,"The vestibule door slid shut behind me. “Walnut. The dining room set is walnut.”

“My bad.”

“Who are you?”

“My name is James.",23,154
1q1usyd,,"I hope that clears everything up for you.”

“James. How do you know where I’m going?”

“So I was in a coma, right. After I was hit by the train.",30,155
1q1usyd,,And suddenly I’m awake. But I really wasn’t awake – it was some kind of brain-injury coma medication-induced crazy dream. I wasn’t me.,23,156
1q1usyd,,"I don’t know who I was, but I was working in train station ticket booth.”

“Where? What station?”

“The sign on the platform said *Hitchcock*.",25,157
1q1usyd,,"I don’t know where that is, but the station was in the middle of nowhere. Surrounded by corn.[ Corn to the horizon. Suddenly you were standing in the ticket window.",30,158
1q1usyd,,"I said ‘*where to?’* And do you know what you said?”]()

“What did I say? Where did I want to go?”

“You said, ‘*Paradise.*’ And you know what’s funny?",29,159
1q1usyd,,"My ticket machine actually *had* Paradise as a destination. So I set the destination pins on the ticket printer, cranked the handle, and it spit out a one-way ticket.",29,160
1q1usyd,,"But before I gave you the ticket, I told you about the special conditions of travel.”

“What were the –”

“Special conditions of travel?",24,161
1q1usyd,,"Well, don’t ask me how my dream-self knew this. I guess I was just really good at my dream job. I remember what I said to you, exactly.",28,162
1q1usyd,,"I said ‘*Before I can issue you this ticket, you must acknowledge that you understand the two conditions of travel. First, know that this is an unusually long journey.",29,163
1q1usyd,,"Are you prepared for the rigors of extended travel by train?*’ Then you said ‘*yes*.’ Then I said ‘*Second, you must not disembark a train, except for the purposes of transfer.",31,164
1q1usyd,,You are prohibited from leaving the premises of any station on the route.,13,165
1q1usyd,,"Do agree to this condition?*’ Then you said ‘*yes’* and then I gave you the ticket.”

“Then what?”

“Then nothing. A train eventually stopped at Hitchcock station.",27,166
1q1usyd,,You got on board.,4,167
1q1usyd,,"Then I woke up in a hospital room, plugged into a ton of tubes and wires.”

I didn’t respond to him immediately, and he didn’t say anything else.",28,168
1q1usyd,,We both silently stared out the window.,7,169
1q1usyd,,"The track had turned away from the shore of the lake a few stops ago, and we now travelled through a dense, snowy forest. “James,” I finally asked him.",29,170
1q1usyd,,“Why did you buy the same ticket as me? Why did you get on this train? You dream about me traveling by train every night?,25,171
1q1usyd,,"Why follow me onto a train in the real world?”

“I dunno man.",13,172
1q1usyd,,"I guess I just want to go to Paradise too.”

 

**\*  \*  \***

 

I had managed to tame my fear of traveling by train by telling myself, over and over, that if something went wrong, I could just get off the train and take a taxi into town.",48,173
1q1usyd,,"But according to James, I agreed not to do this when I bought my ticket. The train slowed to a crawl. The conductor marched through the compartment shouting “Basingstoke.",29,174
1q1usyd,,"This station is Basingstoke.”

I stood up and took my overnight bag off the luggage shelf. “Whoa! Hey man, what are you doing?”

“James, I’m getting the Hell. Off. This.",30,175
1q1usyd,,"Train. Good luck.”

“You can’t! You acknowledged the conditions of travel – you said you wouldn’t get off!”

“No.",19,176
1q1usyd,,You said a dream version of me that happed to be in your brain-injury-induced hallucination agreed to stay on the train.,21,177
1q1usyd,,"I, me, the actual person that actually exists in the actual world, never agreed to anything. I’m getting off.",19,178
1q1usyd,,"Basingstoke sounds like a nice place.”

James jumped up from his seat and slung his enormous backpack over a shoulder with a grunt. “You can’t. We’re going to Paradise!",29,179
1q1usyd,,Look – I even brought a bunch of snacks for the long ride.” He shifted his backpack around to show me how stuffed it was.,25,180
1q1usyd,,"“I got all these to share with you. We’ll be okay.”

I was already walking away. I stepped into the vestibule as the train came to a halt.",28,181
1q1usyd,,"“Leaving the station is *prohibited!”* James shouted as he followed. I stepped down off the train onto the Basingstoke station platform. James stopped in the vestibule, and wrung his hands.",30,182
1q1usyd,,"“This is a bad idea!”

I ignored him and started walking down the platform to the station exit. I heard him hop off the train behind me.",27,183
1q1usyd,,"“I’m going to wait for you here,” he yelled. “Be sure to come back as soon as you can.”

I had no plans to return to the station.",28,184
1q1usyd,,"I was going to find a taxi or a bus or a car rental or something, and figure out how to get back home.",24,185
1q1usyd,,"I marched towards the platform exit, following a handful of other passengers who also got off at Basingstoke. All were bundled in winter dress – long coats, colorful scarves.",29,186
1q1usyd,,A woman in a red wool jacket and matching knit hat carried a package wrapped in candy-cane print paper.,19,187
1q1usyd,,"I passed through the station’s wrought-iron gate and into the town of Basingstoke. Basingstoke, I discovered, wasn’t a very big town. It wasn’t much of a town at all.",29,188
1q1usyd,,"A dozen old buildings sat on each side of Baskingstoke’s only street. Signs over storefronts advertised basic-sounding store names: *Pharmacy*, *Grocery*, *Shoes*.",22,189
1q1usyd,,A brick building bearing the gold-leafed words *Town Hall* stood at the other end of the street. There were no side streets.,22,190
1q1usyd,,"None that I could see from the station, anyway. It seemed that Basingstoke consisted of a train station, a main street, and nothing else. Wasn’t there a bus station?",29,191
1q1usyd,,"A taxi service? A Car rental place? I pulled out my mobile phone – no signal. No problem, I told myself. I’ll just deal with this the old fashioned way.",30,192
1q1usyd,,"I’ll actually talk to someone myself and ask for help. Maybe even use a landline, like the good old days.",20,193
1q1usyd,,"I looked around to find one of my fellow passengers who got off the train with me, but they were already gone. The streets were empty.",26,194
1q1usyd,,"Correction, the street (singular) was empty. Even though it was only 4:00pm it was already getting dark. What would happen when the sun went down?",25,195
1q1usyd,,"Would the few stores that were open in this single-street town close up? If I was going to find someone to help me, I had to do it soon.",29,196
1q1usyd,,"I focused on the store named *Pharmacy* about halfway down the street. The lights were on, meaning, I hoped, that the store was still open.",25,197
1q1usyd,,"The sidewalk was clear, but I had to cross the street to get to the pharmacy.",16,198
1q1usyd,,"By the look of the snow accumulation on the roofs of buildings and the small median strip running down the center of the street, about eight inches had fallen recently.",30,199
1q1usyd,,My shoes were the ones I decided to put on my feet when I left for my trip. A shoe choice made when it was summer in the real world.,30,200
1q1usyd,,"I looked for a way around the snowy median. Seeing no other way to get to the Pharmacy than walking over the median, I grimaced and crossed.",27,201
1q1usyd,,"I plopped my foot onto the snow-covered median, expecting to instantly feel cold and wet powder fall into my low-cut shoes.",21,202
1q1usyd,,"Instead, my foot didn’t even break the surface of the snow. I probed the white surface with my foot. It wasn’t even snow!",23,203
1q1usyd,,"It was a thick, white, spongy blanket that had been laid over the middle of the street. It wasn’t even cold.",21,204
1q1usyd,,"I looked around again to see if anyone was watching me, but the street was still empty.",17,205
1q1usyd,,"I stepped onto the fake snow with both feet and experimentally hopped up and down, feeling the springiness of the material.",21,206
1q1usyd,,"With three long strides, I crossed the springy, faux-snow median, then jogged to the opposite sidewalk. I looked around again, this time studying the scene more carefully.",27,207
1q1usyd,,The street was still empty – nothing moved except me. There were a few cars parked at the curb in front of the store named *Grocery*. They were old models.,30,208
1q1usyd,,Really old. With tailfins and whitewalls out of the 1960s.,10,209
1q1usyd,,"The signs above the stores – *Grocery*, *Shoes*, *Pharmacy* – were printed in red letters using an old-fashioned typeface that reminded me of the iconic *Fabulous Las Vegas* sign. Retro.",30,210
1q1usyd,,"Olde-Tyme. I studied the snow on the store awnings and rooftops – at a closer look, it was the same springy white carpet that was laid across the road median.",30,211
1q1usyd,,"The more I looked around, the more *wrong* the scene was. The trees in the median were all the same.",20,212
1q1usyd,,"I mean, exactly the same – they had the same pattern of branching limbs and leaves. *Leaves?* It was winter – the trees should be bare.",26,213
1q1usyd,,"Even the air was wrong. I was dressed for a summer business trip – inappropriate shirt, pants, and shoes for winter. Yet I wasn’t cold at all.",27,214
1q1usyd,,"The air was comfortably room-temperature. I jogged to the Pharmacy and pulled on the door. It didn’t open. I tugged harder, but couldn’t get the door to budge.",28,215
1q1usyd,,I peered into the store and saw that it was empty. Completely empty. No shelves. No counters or cash registers. No rows of fluorescent lights on the ceiling.,28,216
1q1usyd,,"The Pharmacy was just an empty box with a single, blazingly bright bulb suspended in the center of the space.",20,217
1q1usyd,,“Damn.” The scope of my problem still hadn’t fully hit me.,11,218
1q1usyd,,"Despite the wrongness of the place, the fake snow, and the seasonally inappropriate leaves on the trees, my brain still fought to stay in the space where I was just an inconvenienced traveler, stuck in a small and run-down town.",40,219
1q1usyd,,"I turned to the street, looked both ways (a useless gesture since the town was completely devoid of human activity) and jogged to the median.",25,220
1q1usyd,,"I tripped on the layer of fake snow, and grabbed one of the trees for balance. It fell over. The tree was plastic. Lightweight, and hollow.",26,221
1q1usyd,,"Where it should have had roots, it had a small cylindrical plug that fit into a matching hole in the median strip. I ran to the store named *Grocery*.",29,222
1q1usyd,,My heart was beating fast – way faster than the short jog called for.,14,223
1q1usyd,,It was the same as *Pharmacy* – an empty shell with a single bare bulb burning inside. I kicked the door out of anger and despair.,26,224
1q1usyd,,"It was plastic, not glass. I ran to one of the cars parked on the street and rapped my knuckles on the hood. Plastic.",24,225
1q1usyd,,"And also completely hollow – it was just a plastic shell of a car. A small ridge ran down the center, from the headlights to the trunk.",27,226
1q1usyd,,The kind of seam you find on cheap injection-molded plastic toys where the two halves of the injection mold fit together.,21,227
1q1usyd,,The other cars were the same – scaled up plastic toys. Toys placed along the side of a street with fake snow and trees on the median.,27,228
1q1usyd,,"A town consisting of fake plastic store fronts. The town of Basingstoke wasn’t a real town. It was a one-to-one scale model of town. *Somnocontinuum*, I thought.",27,229
1q1usyd,,This is all just a vivid episode of my sleep disorder. *That’s all it is. I’ll wake up and just have a regular boring Wednesday. Alarm. Coffee. Shit. Shower. Commute.,30,230
1q1usyd,,Work*. The thought of a routine Wednesday brought me comfort until I realized that it already was Wednesday and I had been traveling on a train.,26,231
1q1usyd,,My waking self was on a train. I woke up already on the train. Or did I?,17,232
1q1usyd,,"If this experience was a manifestation of somnocontinuum, it was presenting itself differently than the thousands of previous nights of dreams. Maybe this *is* real?",25,233
1q1usyd,,I couldn’t reason my way through it. I stopped trying and started acting. I ran back towards the train station. *I’ll get back on the train.,26,234
1q1usyd,,"I’ll get on the train, and go to sleep. This will all be fixed when I wake up.*

I ran through the station’s gate.",24,235
1q1usyd,,The tiny station was different than when I left it a few minutes earlier. The basic structure was the same – it was still a commuter station serving two tracks.,30,236
1q1usyd,,A small brick building held a waiting area and a ticket counter. A pedestrian walkway gave access to the platform on the opposite track.,24,237
1q1usyd,,"The train I had arrived on was gone and both tracks were empty, waiting for the next arrival. But now the station was made of plastic.",26,238
1q1usyd,,"I banged on the brick wall of the ticketing building – plastic. The benches for waiting passengers were like cheap plastic toys, scaled up.",24,239
1q1usyd,,The clock – at first glance an ornate wrought-iron pedestal holding a four-sided clock – wasn’t real.,17,240
1q1usyd,,"The hands were painted on the clock face, forever announcing that it was 4:00. I pushed on the pedestal and it wobbled – a plastic facsimile of a wrought-iron object.",30,241
1q1usyd,,I pushed it again out of frustration. It fell over with a plasticky-sounding clack. Backpack guy was still standing where I left him. “James!” I called. He didn’t answer.,29,242
1q1usyd,,"He didn’t even move. I walked towards him, shouting his name. Still no reaction. I got even closer. His clothes. His backpack. Even his skin was shiny and smooth.",29,243
1q1usyd,,"James was now a life-sized replica of the human version of James. I experimentally tapped his chest. Plastic. Hollow. “James, what happened?” He didn’t answer.",25,244
1q1usyd,,A small arrivals and departures board hung from the roof over the ticket counter.,14,245
1q1usyd,,"It also appeared to be plastic, with an unchanging train schedule printed on a sticker that had been applied to the departure board:

*Paradise: track 1*

*Redding: track 2*

I sat on the plastic bench next to the ticket window.",40,246
1q1usyd,,"It sagged under my weight. It was designed to look like bench, not to function like one. *Designed*. By who? Why?",21,247
1q1usyd,,"Why was Basingstoke a life-sized version of a model railroad set? I pulled my phone out, and found that it was dead. A rectangle of black glass.",27,248
1q1usyd,,The town was a lifeless model and the station was perfectly silent. The air was completely still. The loudest sound was that of my own breathing.,26,249
1q1usyd,,"Underneath that, I could hear my heart – a rhythmic sloshing sound that seemed to emanate from my inner ear.",20,250
1q1usyd,,I don’t know how long I sat in on the sagging plastic bench listening to my own breathing.,18,251
1q1usyd,,"The sun had set while I was exploring Basingstoke’s fake main street, and the railroad station clock was a fake – painted clock hands on a plastic model.",28,252
1q1usyd,,"Nothing moved – not even James. I might have sat there for twenty minutes. Or five hours. Finally, I heard a sound that wasn’t made by me. A train whistle.",30,253
1q1usyd,,"Then a second whistle from the other direction. Soon after, the familiar clanking sound of trains came from both directions.",20,254
1q1usyd,,"If the printed sticker on the plastic departures board was right, the train on the track next to the platform was the one for Redding.",25,255
1q1usyd,,"The other train was destined for Paradise. Both trains arrived at the same time. From the right, the Redding train crawled to the station and squealed to a halt.",29,256
1q1usyd,,The Paradise train stopped on track 2. The trains were real. Metal. Heavy. Grimy. Noisy. Real trains stopping at a model train-set station.,23,257
1q1usyd,,"Both trains opened their doors with a hiss. Nobody got out of the train bound for Redding. The Paradise train was on the far track, obscured by the Redding train.",30,258
1q1usyd,,"I couldn’t see whether anyone disembarked. For just a moment, I thought about getting on the Paradise-bound train.",18,259
1q1usyd,,"Some version of me, a version that lived in someone else’s dream, wanted to go there. “Nope.” I had spent enough time attempting to travel to Paradise.",27,260
1q1usyd,,"I climbed onto the train for Redding. I looked behind me from the vestibule. James, or the plastic statue of James, stood on the platform.",25,261
1q1usyd,,Hunched over under the weight of his fake backpack. A worried expression painted onto his plastic face. The door hissed shut and the train slowly rolled away from Basingstoke.,29,262
1q1usyd,,"The Redding train traveled back the way I had come. Through three tiny stops. Past the frozen lake. I fell asleep, and dreamed of Basingstoke.",25,263
1q1usyd,,"When I woke, it was summer. Other passengers rode the train with me. And Redding was the next stop. I still suffer from somnocontinuum. But my symptoms have changed.",29,264
1q1usyd,,"Each night is the same dream. Not a continuation from the previous dream, but one that is *exactly* the same as the previous one.",24,265
1q1usyd,,"In my dream, I am the frozen, lifeless, plastic figure of James. I stand on the silent platform, looking at the fake clock lying on the ground.",27,266
1q1usyd,,"Every night, I spend hour after hour staring, unblinking, at the painted clock’s hands forever announcing that it is 4:00. Still, [l]( often dream of [trains](",26,267
1q1twgi,I saw my girlfriend at her own funeral....,"She first appeared at the funeral. I saw her through the corner of my teary eyes. It was unmistakable, standing behind a tree, at her own funeral……this was my Catherine.",30,0
1q1twgi,,"Those cheerful eyes, now consumed by an endless void, the face that once held the smile that could cheer you up even on the darkest days, now pale and…. empty.",30,1
1q1twgi,,Wearing a black veil that covered her entire body.,9,2
1q1twgi,,"Without a second thought I ran up to her, going for a hug, but found nothing, except for the piercing gaze of those present at the funeral.",27,3
1q1twgi,,"Some of it filled with pity for me, like I’ve lost my mind, while some filled with frustration, like I’m ruining this moment for them.",25,4
1q1twgi,,"I still think about that night, one thing led to another and there she was, opening her car door, after a heated argument. She never made it home.",28,5
1q1twgi,,"It was some…. drunk guy, intoxicated, with pockets full of daddy’s money, ready to take away everything I’ve ever had.",20,6
1q1twgi,,"I got the news in the morning, at which point I was just getting ready to go and apologise.",19,7
1q1twgi,,"I never got the chance to, I still remember the days we talked about growing old, sitting in that fancy front porch, seeing our grandchildren play...",26,8
1q1twgi,,"and yet there she was last night, bleeding out in the cold while the person she loved the most was sleeping in his bed, angry over stupid little things.",29,9
1q1twgi,,"I should’ve stopped her, I know I KNOW. And there hasn’t been a single second when that thought didn’t cross my mind. The pain, the regret... the guilt.",28,10
1q1twgi,,"Life hasn’t been easy without her, the house….it feels haunted by her memories. Each step I take could’ve been a step taken with her.",24,11
1q1twgi,,"I’ve just been spending my days on the couch, praying to God that is just some super realistic dream that I will eventually wake up from.",26,12
1q1twgi,,The darkness keeps me company and the endless noise from the TV never lets me think. And honestly…. its better this way. That was when she appeared again.,28,13
1q1twgi,,"Not my Catherine, can’t be. It just followed me, observed every single one of my moves, but did nothing.",19,14
1q1twgi,,I never told anyone that I was being followed by a ghost…. or demon or whatever.,16,15
1q1twgi,,"You see around town I was already known as “Junkie Jake”, the guy who lost his mind after the death of his girlfriend, who spends his days in his cave doing all sorts of drugs.",35,16
1q1twgi,,"My health started getting worse when she was around, it started with mild headaches and fatigue, nothing a cup of coffee and some marijuana can’t fix.",26,17
1q1twgi,,Eventually it evolved into nightmares and loss of appetite.... still not a big concern for me. Though I eventually realized that I was in real danger.,26,18
1q1twgi,,"It was raining that night, the noise of the raindrops combined with the fatigue of not sleeping for days made me do the impossible, for the first time in weeks….",30,19
1q1twgi,,I slept in peace.,4,20
1q1twgi,,"“You’re right, I can’t do this right now, im leavin-’ I jolted awake, to see nothing but darkness, not because my room wasn’t lit up, but because the void in those eyes was way too close to mine.",38,21
1q1twgi,,"I could feel her sitting on me, breathing heavily, almost as if leaning in for a kiss.",17,22
1q1twgi,,"That was when I got my senses back and felt a sharp pain run down my spine, her claws… she was digging me open.",24,23
1q1twgi,,"I screamed but to no avail, as if the even the words were too scared to come out, as the claws made their way to my heart, I felt my senses fade out again.",34,24
1q1twgi,,"And through the void, a voice spoke.",7,25
1q1twgi,,"“You know this one time when I was in eighth grade, there was this boy in my class and he was just SO cute….” It was Catherine.",27,26
1q1twgi,,"“Not a care in the world, picking fights with the teachers… making weird jokes in class….”
I remembered this day. “That boy was you….",24,27
1q1twgi,,"Jake.” She said, with a face as red as a tomato. I stood there, watching the past us sit on a beach, watching the sun paint the blue sky golden.",30,28
1q1twgi,,That was the day we confessed our love to each other.,11,29
1q1twgi,,"Even though I had lived this moment before, and even though I stood in a corner, my heart still pounded faster than ever.",23,30
1q1twgi,,"As I watched her lips slowly come closer to mine, both too shy to kiss. I saw it again, the black entity… watching from another corner.",26,31
1q1twgi,,"She finally said “So to answer your question…. of course— ”

“-- I HATE YOU!!” Catherine screamed, different…. Catherine.",20,32
1q1twgi,,“You started smoking that SHIT AGAIN?!” This was…..from our very last conversation.,12,33
1q1twgi,,"I jolted back to my senses, “Cath sto-”

1q1twgi,,"Past me spoke, “Babe it’s just, it’s been har-”
“YOU PROMISED JAKE!!” Catherine continued to lash out. “Look…. I- I’m sorry.” I stood up from the couch.",27,35
1q1twgi,,“Is this what you have been doing behind my back?,10,36
1q1twgi,,"All this time?”
The room went silent, and past me tilted his head down in a losing pose

“WHAT THE FUCK JAKE!!",22,37
1q1twgi,,"YOU LIAR!!” I could hear her voice start to tremble. “Take a deep breath Cath, let’s forget this, go get changed…. I’ll put this away”
“Forget what Jake?? Forget what?",30,38
1q1twgi,,You’re the one who’s-” Tears start to stream down her eyes. I sat in horror as I watched myself make the biggest mistake of my life.,26,39
1q1twgi,,"“NO STOP YOU IDIO-” The gaze intensified, and paralyzed me. “Why…. why Jake, why. Everything was good”
“YEA, EVERYTHING WAS GOOD, EVERYTHING WAS GREAT” past me lashed out.",28,40

“-- gonna be okay” Past Jake said, while kissing her forehead.",28,41
1q1twgi,,"Both sitting on the same dinner table, exactly a year ago. I wasn’t afraid anymore, just confused. “Where are we going with this” I asked the entity. No reply.",29,42

“And what if we can’t?” Catherine asked.",22,43

“Thank you…. Jake, for being here with me” Catherine said while wiping her tears. There was a change this time, rather…. No change.",30,44
1q1twgi,,"The moment didn’t abruptly change and I was just left here, wondering. “Seems perfect, doesn’t it?” The entity spoke from behind me, for the first time.",26,45

1q1twgi,,"The entity pointed his finger to something, and as I looked, I realized we were back. “This disease it….",19,47
1q1twgi,,It ruined everything.” I saw more tears form in her eyes but I didn’t stop.,15,48
1q1twgi,,"“You made me quit, you moved in, wanted to get married, have kids and i- it’s just too much for me to handle”
“I’m sorry Cath, we were together but things still changed, this disease it….",36,49
1q1twgi,,"It changed us, you grew tired and I grew bitter, and there was nothing we did to stop it.”
At that point she wasn’t even facing me, I could only hear her sob.",33,50
1q1twgi,,"I suppose that was when I realized what an idiot I was, and shamelessly went to hug her, as if that would fix all the damage I had caused.",29,51
1q1twgi,,"“No No NO fuck shit- I’m sorry babe I didn’t…. I didn’t-“
“I get it Jake… I mean, an asthmatic girlfriend…” she replied, trying to hold back her tears.",29,52
1q1twgi,,"“You’re right, I can’t do this right now” she grabbed her keys and began walking towards me. She tried to kiss my cheek before leaving but…. she couldn’t.",28,53
1q1twgi,,"I could hear her quiet sobs near my ear, and that was the moment I teared up too.",18,54
1q1twgi,,"“Go sleep Jake, you seem tired”
She walked out that door and I….from the past, sat down at the table, in defeat.",22,55
1q1twgi,,"As Catherine was starting her car, I was teleported again, but this time it wasn’t the entity that bought me here, it was someone else.",25,56
1q1twgi,,“Hey how long would it take you to forget about me if I die?” Catherine asked.,16,57
1q1twgi,,"This was from way early on in our relationship, we were both sitting on a bench, in a garden.",19,58
1q1twgi,,"“Honestly, I don’t think I ever would, I would probably chase you even after death.” Past me replied.",18,59
1q1twgi,,"“Don’t worry you won’t have to, I’ll haunt you forever” 

Every single time I looked back at this conversation, It just seemed like those cute nonsense stuff couples talked about, but not today…..it was time for me to live up to my promise.",43,60
1q1twgi,,"I closed my eyes and ran, not knowing where I would end up, but somehow I ended up exactly where I wanted to be.",24,61
1q1twgi,,"Near the car, with her wrapped around in my arms. “I love you babe, I’m sorry, I mean it… I’m sorry.",21,62
1q1twgi,,"I’m sorry that I let things change, I’m sorry for not fully being with you when life was hard, when you came into my life… all those years ago?",29,63
1q1twgi,,"It was like all the puzzles in my life solved themselves, you made me feel complete, but in return I- I failed you Catherine”
“And there is nothing in this world I wouldn’t give to make things right again, I don’t care about anything else, I just want you, and even all the problems that you have, forgive me….",59,64
1q1twgi,,"please.”

As I finished apologizing I realized I wasn’t hugging anything. Catherine wasn’t in my arms, she was infront of me, dead.",22,65
1q1twgi,,"She was lying on the ground after the car accident, in the pool of her own blood, bones broken, throat slit from the debris.",24,66
1q1twgi,,“You thought it was that easy?” The entity spoke from behind me.,12,67
1q1twgi,,"“To receive salvation…from the ones you failed, life doesn’t work like that Jake”
“You had your chance when she was with you, but you were engaged in the things you mortals love to engage in… anger, impatience, ego.” It continued.",40,68
1q1twgi,,“YOU HAD YOUR CHANCE JAKE BUT YOU DID NOTHING….,9,69
1q1twgi,,"And now you shamelessly come here, and beg for forgiveness after you fucked up everything.” 

I didn’t speak, well… I had nothing to say, he was right.",27,70
1q1twgi,,“Let me give you a final choice” The entity looked at me and we were teleported to our final destination.,20,71
1q1twgi,,"It was me, sitting alone in a small apartment room, high. There was moss growing on the ceiling, and the room smelled like a junkyard. I looked miserable, obese….",29,72
1q1twgi,,"barely fitting in my chair, bags under eyes like I haven’t slept in decades. And looking at my current situation… I wasn’t too far off from this.",27,73
1q1twgi,,“You like that?” The entity asked. “Ofcourse not” I replied.,10,74
1q1twgi,,"“But that’s all that is left for you from here”

I looked as the other me struggled to stand up from the chair, he took a few steps towards the kitchen and then stopped again to catch his breath.",39,75
1q1twgi,,"“As for your second option, turn around.”
I turned around to see void, and in the middle of that was a fan, chair and a rope.",26,76
1q1twgi,,"“The choice is yours Jake.”
Without a moment’s hesitation, I knew what my choice was, I started walking, and it grew darker.",22,77
1q1twgi,,"“Damn, what a lame ass way to go out, huh?” I chuckled to myself.",14,78
1q1twgi,,"And as I went further the darkness consumed me more, the final light went out soon enough and the sensations with it, I was left all alone in darkness, it was… cold, colder than what you’d think dying feels like.",40,79
1q1twgi,,"I was scared. “Giving up so soon?” 
As I heard those words the darkness pulled away, to reveal a bright dreamy sky.",22,80
1q1twgi,,"The pain, the cold, the fear all went away as I felt the warmth of her hands on mine.",19,81
1q1twgi,,"It was catherine, and this time I was sure she was MY catherine, she was glowing like a star, and looked absolutely beautiful.",23,82
1q1twgi,,"“This isn’t one of my memories, is it?” I asked. “Which one of your memories involves me looking like… this”
“Only all of them” I smiled.",26,83
1q1twgi,,“I missed this Jake” She said while holding my hand tighter than before. “You saw it? Me… after you died?” I asked.,22,84
1q1twgi,,"“Ofcourse I did, and it absolutely broke me, I wish I could’ve reached out sooner” 
“Listen I’m sorry-” 
“I already heard your apology, I gotta say it was pretty solid” She interrupted.",32,85
1q1twgi,,“So….,1,86
1q1twgi,,"Do you forgive me?” 
She didn’t reply, instead she leaned in and kissed me on the forehead, that’s all I needed to know, tears started flowing down my eyes and I fell down to my knees.",36,87
1q1twgi,,"“I’m sorry too you know… I should’ve known how you were just as much, if not more stressed than me, after all… we promised to always understand each other” She said.",31,88
1q1twgi,,"“So what now? I was the one who made the choice”
“And are you happy with it?” She asked.",19,89
1q1twgi,,"“Well it does seem better than being a miserable fat old man, who cant even walk 5 steps without catching his breath”
 
“But what if those weren’t the only choices?” 
“What do you me-” before I could finish speaking, catherine held both my hands and for a split second….",49,90
1q1twgi,,"I saw it. A life where I wasn’t miserable, where at the end I sat on my porch, satisfied that I didn’t give up on life.",26,91
1q1twgi,,"I saw what wasn’t meant to be seen, I saw hope.",11,92
1q1twgi,,"“NOW make your choice, Jake… ” 
“What if I don’t wanna go back, what if I wanna just stay here, with you” 
“The pain of waking up everyday, knowing I have to live without you,,, its too damn much” 
“I miss you… Cath.”
“And what’s wrong with that?” She replied.",50,93
1q1twgi,,"“There’s nothing wrong with missing someone… Jake, but one day the hurt will stop, it’s gonna take some time but when that time comes… be willing to let that pain go.”

“And until that time comes, just know that every time you feel the hurt, I will be there”
“I will be in the air you breath, and in the music you listen”
“On a sunny day I will be the sunlight and on a cloudy one, I will be the raindrop”
“I will be in the breeze on that summer night, and in the starry sky you always admire”
“On the days you feels low, when the pain takes over, I will be the jokes that cheer you up”
“And on the days you feel victorious, I will be the cheering”
“I won’t leave you Jake, whenever you miss me, just look around”

And with that, she kissed me one last time and the void in my heart was filled, the scars healed.",164,94
1q1twgi,,"I was back in my room again and realized I was holding a bottle of pills in my hand, I looked at the morning sunlight, smiled, and threw it away.",30,95
1q1twgi,,"I moved on with life, without ever looking back, because this time… she wasn’t being left behind.",17,96
1q1spbm,Sever The Static,"Crickets make peaceful company; a lulling ambience to soothe the quiet side road, where a girl can puff another smoke, wondering what lecture Chief's gonna bark come morning.",28,0
1q1spbm,,"But my night was only beginning. The dash radio didn't just crackle to life - it sputtered in jumbled, inaudible pieces.",21,1
1q1spbm,,"I assumed the worn-down piece of shit was broken as I flicked away my butt and slogged back to the door, but I barely had time to sit down when a man's voice slipped through the garbled static.",38,2
1q1spbm,,"""*10-33, all units! \[static\] 10-33, all units, please, I'm-*"" Something was wrong with his voice.",15,3
1q1spbm,,"Each burst of static carried a different version of the same man; layered, varied tones out of sync. ""*Swallow Coast is \[static\] Swallow Coast is gone--Swallow Coast is...",28,4
1q1spbm,,"wrong \[static\]* *PLEASE, MY*\-""

The voices then stumbled together into a single, dead tone and repeated the same phrase over and over.",22,5
1q1spbm,,"""*help us*""

Then it broke apart again, overlapping into a shattered mess of protocol codes, before cutting off to a null silence.",22,6
1q1spbm,,"My hand was halfway to the volume knob, trembling; I'd heard panicked officers be shot at before, fighting to speak, but never had I heard *anything* like that. A glitch?",30,7
1q1spbm,,"A ghost? A dream? My mind raced down every avenue, but a single ugly detail kept pecking at my brain. 'Swallow Coast'

Training kicked in.",25,8
1q1spbm,,"""Dispatch, 3-Adam-12,"" I said, my voice sounding far steadier than I felt. ""Copy an unknown 10-33 that just came over my in-car.",22,9
1q1spbm,,"Unidentified officer, no call sign, giving location as 'Swallow Coast.'""

I stared out at the empty road.",17,10
1q1spbm,,"""Be advised,"" I added, forcing the words out, ""I don't show a 'Swallow Coast' on any local grids.",18,11
1q1spbm,,"Can you run a trace on the transmission?""

I released the button, and the radio went back to dead air.",20,12
1q1spbm,,"""3-Adam-12, Dispatch here."" Her voice was calm, but there was a hesitance to it.",14,13
1q1spbm,,"""We've got a hit.""

""Go ahead, Dispatch.""

""Signal's bouncing off the east repeater, origin somewhere off County Road 17, past marker 22."" Papers rustled faintly on her end.",28,14
1q1spbm,,"""Be advised that stretch is... it just *ends* out there.""

I squinted through the windshield, trying to picture it. I'd patrolled that road a hundred times. ""Dispatch, confirm.",28,15
1q1spbm,,"You're telling me an emergency call came from the middle of nowhere?""

""Affirmative.",13,16
1q1spbm,,"How do you want to proceed?""

I glanced at the black stretch of highway disappearing into the trees, and took a deep breath.",23,17
1q1spbm,,"""Dispatch, show me en route.""

I flipped on my lights and pulled back onto the tar, my headlights carving a narrow tunnel through the ensemble of timber.",27,18
1q1spbm,,"The silence became a pressure; the radio a faint, constant open breath as I ran the familiar stretch.",18,19
1q1spbm,,"""Dispatch, 3-Adam-12,"" I said, ""Confirm last known origin was off 17, past marker 22.""

""Affirmative.",15,20
1q1spbm,,"You should be the only thing moving out there.""

The terrain began to climb; the highway curled along the flank of a mountain in long, sweeping turns where only a guardrail stood between me and a steep drop.",38,21
1q1spbm,,"When the trees broke, I caught glimpses of it - the pale smear of the heaving Pacific.",17,22
1q1spbm,,"By 21, the air had turned damp and cold, seeping in through the vents. My GPS started to lag - a little car sliding over green nothing.",27,23
1q1spbm,,"I frowned, tapping the casing with a knuckle, when the weather-beaten marker 22 lurched out of the shadows. I parked beside it.",22,24
1q1spbm,,"Fifty yards past the marker, veering off the road and into the wild on a narrowing, overgrown trail, the path, as described, stopped. A hard, abrupt gravel edge.",28,25
1q1spbm,,"""Dispatch, be advised. I've arrived at origin-""

The speaker exploded into unrelenting noise. Not static, not feedback - voices; a hundred of them at once, slamming into my ears.",29,26
1q1spbm,,"Snatches of jingles, movie lines, sitcom laughs, news anchors, late-night preachers, kids shouting over commercials, pop songs, intimate phone calls; every recorded sound I'd ever heard stacked on top of each other, out of tune.",35,27
1q1spbm,,Out of time.,3,28
1q1spbm,,"""-*copy that, over and out--he's looking at you, kid--baby, don't hurt me, don't--breaking news tonight as officials--wake up, she's here*.""

""Dispatch?!"" I snapped, one hand clamped on the mic, the other white-knuckled around the wheel.",35,29
1q1spbm,,"""Dispatch, I'm experiencing a malfunction!",5,30
1q1spbm,,"Do you copy?!""

""*-late night deals you won't believe--please, if anyone is there--this is not a test, this is an emergency broadcast*\-""

Something thudded softly under my foot.",28,31
1q1spbm,,"The brake pedal sank half an inch. I hadn't moved my leg. ""No...""

I stomped down, hard. The pedal met resistance - then, bit by bit, pushed back against me.",30,32
1q1spbm,,"The gear lever clicked. PARK - REVERSE - DRIVE

""Dispatch, I-""

""-*we now return to your feature presentation*\-""

The cruiser began to roll.",23,33
1q1spbm,,"Slow at first, just a whisper over the gravel as I slammed my foot on the brakes, and it shrugged me off.",22,34
1q1spbm,,The wheel didn't budge either as the car aligned with the void ahead. I twisted the key out! Nothing!,19,35
1q1spbm,,"A canned studio audience roared out from the radio, drowning out a weatherman promising clear skies and a man's ragged voice yelling, ""*They cut the road, they CUT THE ROAD-*""

I grabbed for the seatbelt, and the latch clicked, but the strap wouldn't release - remaining locked across my chest.",50,36
1q1spbm,,"I hit the door handle, but it bounced against the damn frame. ""Come on!"" I spat, slamming my shoulder into it. Fruitless.",22,37
1q1spbm,,"The car rolled on, patient and unbothered by my efforts. A hoarse male voice cut through the layers.",18,38
1q1spbm,,"""*Please-if anyone-I've got a daughter in*\-""

Static chewed him up and vomited him back out as a game show buzzer.",20,39
1q1spbm,,"""-*wrong answer, but thanks for playing*\-""

""Stop,"" I murmured, my nerves becoming shot. Far ahead, at the very end of the light, something began to take shape.",27,40
1q1spbm,,"It was a dense patch of shimmering thin white; a near-transparent wall where empty air should've been. Fog, I told myself. Except fog didn't sit flat. Forty yards.",28,41
1q1spbm,,"The wall resolved into a smooth sheet of glitching white-and-black, texture-less, depthless static.",13,42
1q1spbm,,And beyond it - for just an instant - I thought I saw the orange smear of streetlights.,18,43
1q1spbm,,"""-*you are now entering--the following film contains--they said the sky was wrong--don't touch that dial, you're gonna get us all*\-"" The radio begged, pleaded, sold me detergent, laughed at its own jokes, as the distance between bumper and curtain shrank.",40,44
1q1spbm,,"Thirty yards. Twenty. ""Stop the fucking car!"" I yelled, losing all professionalism as I hammered the windows and wheel, the horn blaring weakly amidst the radio's storm.",27,45
1q1spbm,,"""-*ma'am, you need to remain calm*\-""

""SHUT THE FUCK UP!""

The glitching veil loomed in, filling the windshield with nothing I had a word for.",25,46
1q1spbm,,"I clawed at the seatbelt, desperate - jump out, climb out, do something, anything, but go through whatever that was, yet my fate was inevitable.",25,47
1q1spbm,,So I did all I had left. I squeezed my eyes shut and braced. And the car rolled in.,19,48
1q1spbm,,"All sense of direction vanished; the seat fell away under me, then jumped back up, and my body felt like it'd plummeted through an ice sheet beyond physics.",28,49
1q1spbm,,"Every voice on the radio hit a single, piercing note. Then silence - a quick, surgical cut into the noise.",20,50
1q1spbm,,"My ears popped as the world slid back in, the car coming to a stop, and after I realised I was still breathing, I slowly forced my eyes open.",29,51
1q1spbm,,"The dead-end road was gone. In its place was a wide, slick street glistening with rain; lined with buildings, flickering neon, and a diner with a crooked 'OPEN' sign.",29,52
1q1spbm,,"A distant pier lamp swung over black water, and, carving its way up a mountain path, was a brass-and-steel observatory gazing at the stars.",24,53
1q1spbm,,"On one corner, a street sign hung from a rusted pole. 'Swallow Coast'

I finally got my hands to move and reached for the gear shift, expecting the same resistance.",30,54
1q1spbm,,"It moved willingly, but the engine was dead; as was my radio.",12,55
1q1spbm,,"I was, however, able to free myself from the seatbelt and sprang out of my powerless cruiser, feeling sick and cold on wobbling legs.",24,56
1q1spbm,,"A pickup truck stalked behind a pale sedan, headlights still faint, like they were running on memory.",17,57
1q1spbm,,"A hatchback rested at an angle to the curb, its front tyre up on the sidewalk, attempting to flee.",19,58
1q1spbm,,"Closer, a cruiser from a foreign department nosed into the intersection - its pattern like mine, but the crest on the door was smudged, like vandalised paint. They were empty.",30,59
1q1spbm,,"Forgotten. ""Dispatch? Are you there?""

... I walked towards a military Humvee, hunched closer to the diner, olive metal dulled by grime.",22,60
1q1spbm,,"A faded stencil on the door spelt 'U.S Army', but the unit markings beneath were the same as the cruiser. The passenger door hung open. I peered in.",28,61
1q1spbm,,"No gear, no duffels, no guns; just seats, and the impression that its occupants simply evaporated.",16,62
1q1spbm,,"The sedan had a purse on the driver's seat, its contents scattered: a wallet, receipts, a cracked phone frozen on a family photo, the seatbelt slack and twisted, the engine cold.",31,63
1q1spbm,,"I turned back the way I'd come, towards where the road should've cut. Instead, the street sloped gently upward until it met a structure that did not belong here.",29,64
1q1spbm,,"At first, I mistook it for a cell tower, but it was a makeshift lattice of metal and cables - antennas speared out; dish arrays, spiralled coils, panels that hummed faintly with colour.",33,65
1q1spbm,,Wires as thick as my arm ran down into a fenced-off outpost bristling with control boxes and blinking lights.,19,66
1q1spbm,,"I had to crane my neck to see the beacon at the peak - a red light flashing randomly. Behind the tower, barely, hung the 'thing' I'd driven through.",29,67
1q1spbm,,"From this side, the veil was much thinner. Instead of a static wall, it was more like distorted glass - a wavering, curving slice of sky that didn't fit.",29,68
1q1spbm,,"More vehicles sat at the base, facing the shimmer; unquestionably military, rusting and rotten, all pointed at the same impossible curtain.",21,69
1q1spbm,,"The tower then hummed as if waking up, and my radio sparked to life - coughing out a single, wailing tone that stung my ears and rattled my teeth.",29,70
1q1spbm,,"I didn't notice it immediately, only catching the structure in the corner of my eye as my head pounded, but up in the mountain, the observatory *shivered*.",27,71
1q1spbm,,"From the street, it looked textbook - a crown perched atop the rocks with domes and spires winking like old coins, highlighted by either its own gleaming light or what they caught from the stars.",35,72
1q1spbm,,"Yet under the signal's pressure, the whole building shook. Then the first **rip** happened.",14,73
1q1spbm,,"The observatory spasmed and snapped, as if a cursor were trying to drag it across a screen; it remained in place, defiantly, but it became distorted, as if shifted through eras.",31,74
1q1spbm,,"For a blink, the glass was cracked and dark, the brass tarnished, and entire sections hung loose, like something blew it up from inside.",24,75
1q1spbm,,"My radio climbed another notch, drilling through my jaw and violating my skull. The observatory jerked again - now under construction.",21,76
1q1spbm,,"Floodlights bleached the mountain path, support beams and half-built walls cast shadows across the rocks; domes became webs of hollow steel, and cranes hung over the whole scene, jittering and flickering as the sky seized from night to day to night again.",42,77
1q1spbm,,"I could almost hear construction noises - shouted instructions, the clatter of tools, the whistling of men.",17,78
1q1spbm,,"I fell to my hands and knees, a trickle of blood oozing from my nose. Everything was vibrating. The observatory stuttered once more. It burned.",25,79
1q1spbm,,"Orange triumphed inside the central dome; flames beat metal, smoke rolled up in a thick column, but didn't behave right - freezing, lagging.",23,80
1q1spbm,,"Something within it pulsed white-hot, brighter than any heat I'd ever seen, as my vision blurred, and the road under me melted, then hardened, becoming dirt and snow and magma.",30,81
1q1spbm,,I tasted metal in the deepest recesses of my throat as my radio reached a pitch I didn't think was possible.,21,82
1q1spbm,,"The observatory tore a final time, but not just the building. The sky above split open.",16,83
1q1spbm,,"A hairline crack at first - a tiny, jagged, thin line - that widened in wild jumps, tearing and stopping, until a gaping wound hung over the mountain.",28,84
1q1spbm,,"A scar of colourless deep, where stars were packed far too close together - undiscovered by any astronomer. They didn't twinkle like jewels. They blinked like eyes.",27,85
1q1spbm,,"A pungent waft of burnt electricity rolled down the mountain and filled the street, as my radio became another chorus of relentless sound. ""-*entrance.",24,86

The radio chuckled - a quick, nervous ripple of different laughs. Ahead, the diner waited.",22,118
1q1spbm,,"The windows stuttered worse than the Humvee - intact, webbed, blown out - and the OPEN sign rolled through the wrong sequence - O P N E - before becoming abstract symbols my eyes slid off.",36,119
1q1spbm,,It hurt to look at.,5,120

The bell above the door rang three different times as the smell hit me.",23,123
1q1spbm,,"Decay - old, dried out, folded under dust and chemicals, and burnt coffee and fried grease soaked so deeply into the walls.",22,124
1q1spbm,,"The stuttering was horrid: seats went from cracked red vinyl to bare springs and torn yellow form, then back again; menus flickered in and out of existence, and a jukebox danced between models.",33,125
1q1spbm,,"Tables had been shoved around a central aisle, their legs braced.",11,126
1q1spbm,,"Cots crowded the floor - army-issue frames sagging under mattresses, sheets twisted and stained, and a portable generator cowered near the counter, its casing open; wires spilt out like guts, threading through ammo crates and jerry-rigged equipment.",37,127
1q1spbm,,"I saw him then. He sat in the last booth, facing the door.",13,128
1q1spbm,,"For a moment, I thought he was asleep - chin tucked, shoulders hunched, but the details became apparent. The soldier was almost a skeleton.",24,129
1q1spbm,,Brittle fatigue clung to him; his uniform stiffened by dust.,10,130
1q1spbm,,"What skin I could see was like parchment, pulled tight over bone in sunken hollows; his dog tag had fused with his collarbone, the metal nesting in a little crater where his flesh had given up, and his jaw hung loose, teeth bared...",43,131

1q1spbm,,"His hand still cupped the air near his temple, fingers frozen around a missing pistol, a dark crater in the booth's backrest staining where the bullet had gone - a grainy, pixelated splatter.",33,133
1q1spbm,,My stomach knotted. Two objects in front of him offered themselves to me.,13,134
1q1spbm,,"The first was a flashlight, stubby and industrial with a wide, dark lens ringed with faded warning tape.",18,135

I cleared my throat. ""Yet he died alone.""

""-*better that than \[static\] lost in--signals-*""

I reached out for the pocket speaker. ""-*careful \[static\] tuned-*"" the academic voice muttered.",30,137
1q1spbm,,"""For what?""

They all spoke at once, a tangle of the same answer. ""-*to be louder than them*\-""

I placed both tools in my belt.",25,138

1q1spbm,,"I breathed a sigh of relief and steadied my pulse... when *his* radio came alive, a clunky handset clipped to his waist. It did not speak; it hissed.",28,140

My own radio crackled in sympathy, and my company interjected, but they were suddenly faint.",24,141

It was a thrash of sound - threats, pleas, curses, prayers, all ground together - that ached my head.",35,144
1q1spbm,,"I didn't hesitate. I reached for the portable speaker, flipped the switch, and my world tunnelled as it squealed a deafening wail.",22,145
1q1spbm,,"The generator hiccupped, the overhead lights burned and burst, the jukebox lit up and spun through songs too fast, and the dead soldier's radio cut off as his body slumped forward.",31,146
1q1spbm,,"Then there was only silence as I found myself alone in a dark diner, the speaker hot against my waist. My own radio crackled twice, confused.",26,147
1q1spbm,,"""*-Ellie?!*""

Then it too failed. And for the first time, Swallow Coast was truly quiet.",15,148

Again. The door didn't move, but the sound was thicker this time - as if underwater.",26,151
1q1spbm,,"The air near the entrance wobbled, just a fraction, as I drew my gun and the flashlight.",17,152
1q1spbm,,"*Ding.*

The doorframe trembled in place, smearing sideways in short, nauseating skips, then bulged and rippled and flattened, and *something* pressed through it. Familiar broken nonsense reached me first.",29,153

The idea of a man began to materialise, cobbled together from a disjointed static mass of flickering grey fuzz; his chest strobed between suits, hoodies, bare skin, hospital gowns, and his face was layers upon layers over a vertical slack - an old man's profile, a child's wide eyes, a woman's gaping mouth mid-scream, a teenager chewing gum.",93,154

On intuition, my thumb pressed the taped switch on the flashlight, and a solid, bruise-dark violet bar erupted and hit the 'man' square in the chest.",27,159
1q1spbm,,"The result was instant. Touched by the light, the static went from grey to a blistering, overexposed white and orange - then burned brighter than the sun.",27,160
1q1spbm,,"Pieces of mismatched people peeled back like melting film, bubbling out of existence, as a dozen borrowed eyes flared and scowled.",21,161
1q1spbm,,"A film-trailer voice gulped mid-sentence, dropping a few octaves, and a jingle stretched into a thin, digital scream as the air around it pulsed back several inches toward normal.",29,162
1q1spbm,,"The creature staggered, raising its jittery, convulsive arms to shield itself; the mosaic of broadcast it used as skin blackened where the beam stayed, edges crisping and curling, as it *roared* \- a remix of half-sponsored messages and corrupted sound bites scratching in my ears.",45,163
1q1spbm,,"It tried to advance, lugging a step towards me, so I fired.",12,164
1q1spbm,,"The bullet hit where the UV light had already cooked its form, right in a raw patch of boiling static, but instead of a clean entry wound, reality tore as its flesh blew open in a geyser of white noise.",40,165

1q1spbm,,"The bullet cut through them all, dragging a comet-tail of glitch with it, as the creature convulsed.",17,167
1q1spbm,,"Every piece of it slipped further out of sync; faces morphed into a screaming collage, several arms twitched in delayed directions, its outline ballooned, as a bomb of sound erupted from it - hurling me off my feet and into a table.",42,168
1q1spbm,,Its body blew outward like a grenade.,7,169
1q1spbm,,"Static detonated into a jagged sphere, shredding through tile and chrome and glass, as half the diner's wall ceased to be - ripped out of space.",26,170
1q1spbm,,"Then it fled onto the street - a teleporting, slithering mass of pained static - before vanishing into the night, leaving a brief, untextured trail of vertigo-inducing grey in its wake.",31,171
1q1spbm,,"The OPEN sign outside flashed a new word in between blinks, letters stuttering into place where they didn't belong.",19,172

""Ha, yeah... *weird*.""

""Well, drive safe. And if I ever need backup again, I'm asking for you personally."" He chuckled and made his leave with a hefty wave.",29,259
1q1spbm,,"I waited until his shape was gone before shrivelling and collapsing into my seat, my hand snapping over my throbbing chest.",21,260
1q1spbm,,"Tears welled up fast and I sobbed and fitted like a toddler, until my radio spoke, and I almost shrieked. ""You're back on the system, 3-Adam-12!",26,261

I composed myself quickly, wiping my face. ""Uh... my car, um-... broke, Dispatch.""

""... broke?""

""That's right.""

""Okay...",25,262

1q1oydp,,"I opened my mouth to yell “Hey, you okay?” but the words kinda died. He was doing backflips. Not running and flipping like some gymnast showing off.",27,7
1q1oydp,,"Just standing there, bending backwards real slow, hands touching the ground behind him, then kicking his legs over and landing on his feet again. Perfect every time.",27,8
1q1oydp,,"No wind-up, no bounce. Flip. Land. Pause half a second. Flip again. I stood there like an idiot watching him do it maybe ten, twelve times.",26,9
1q1oydp,,"Same exact motion, same exact spot. Didn’t make a sound no breathing heavy, no leaves crunching under his feet. Nothing.",20,10
1q1oydp,,"I finally got my shit together and took a couple steps closer, trying to see his face. He never looked up.",21,11

1q1oydp,,Didn’t run didn’t want him to hear but I moved fast. That night I kept my knife out and barely slept. Every snap of a twig had me sitting up.,30,15

1q1oydp,,"Took the long way out, added an extra day of walking just to hit a trail I knew.",18,17
1q1oydp,,"Got back to the truck a day early, drove straight home, took a long shower. Didn’t tell anybody for weeks.",20,18

Comments were full of people who’d seen the exact same thing. One dude said he watched for twenty minutes straight.",26,21
1q1oydp,,"Another said he went back the next weekend with a better camera and the guy was still there, still flipping. Got within shouting distance and the guy just… wasn’t.",29,22
1q1oydp,,Like he vanished the second you decided to get closer. I haven’t been back to that ridge.,17,23
1q1oydp,,"Sometimes when it’s real quiet at night I’ll think about it how smooth those flips were, how he never got tired, never looked around. Just flipping. Over and over.",29,24

1q1ofjx,,The Northwest United States is famous for a lot of things; the peacefulness of its fauna is not one of those things.,22,31
1q1ofjx,,The thought of bears or wolves stalking you festers in the back of your mind in the same way that you’re afraid of the bogeyman.,25,32

1q1ofjx,,"No birds, no crickets, any rustling in the leaves was from the wind. All I could hear was the clicking of the revolver as I held my hand over it.",30,37
1q1ofjx,,"I kept a brisk pace, not wanting to stay long. As I got closer though, the faintest sound occupied the air.",21,38
1q1ofjx,,"It was a droning sound, a low, constant vibration, but quiet enough to just feel like it was creeping into my skull.",22,39
1q1ofjx,,"I only made it halfway to the site before being stopped though. There was a call, like a doe’s… but not quite.",22,40
1q1ofjx,,I’m not stupid; teenage campers always love to talk about “skin walkers” in these woods to try and scare each other.,21,41
1q1ofjx,,"Park rangers like us are all numb to it though, but in that moment, I felt the air escape my lungs as I stared towards the direction I heard it.",30,42
1q1ofjx,,"I heard it again and tried to make more sense of it. It was coming from a deer, it had to, but it sounded in pain.",26,43
1q1ofjx,,"We’ve had to deal with a lot of deer that’ve had accidents on the road, and that noise was right where my mind went to.",25,44
1q1ofjx,,"It always sickened me, the way the poor animal calls out, begging for something to make the pain stop, helpless to save itself.",23,45
1q1ofjx,,But it didn’t make sense- we were miles away from any main road. I pushed my panic deeper down and approached the agonized being.,24,46
1q1ofjx,,"At the edge of my light’s reach, I saw it. I was right; it was a deer. It was collapsed on the ground, wailing out and writhing.",27,47
1q1ofjx,,"My first guess was that it had just been attacked by something, but as I got closer, there were no clear signs of attack.",24,48
1q1ofjx,,There wasn’t any blood on or around the animal. I looked at the neck of it though and was startled. I was already expecting a visceral scene.,27,49
1q1ofjx,,"Any predator would’ve gone for the throat, tearing at the major arteries, but there were no signs of external damage. But there was something very wrong.",26,50
1q1ofjx,,"The neck of the poor thing was swollen, so much so that it couldn’t turn its head, barely being able to lift it to even breathe.",26,51
1q1ofjx,,"Its jaw had been dislocated, forcing it to open to an unnatural degree.",13,52
1q1ofjx,,"Every breath was strained and forced, choking on itself, every muscle twitching as if it were screaming for oxygen.",19,53
1q1ofjx,,It was a fighter; I could tell from the terrified look in its eyes—it was scared.,16,54
1q1ofjx,,"The body spasmed out, the once aggressive kicking turned to paralyzing twitching in its legs, but still it was still wheezing. It called out again… but this was different.",29,55
1q1ofjx,,"It was less pained, less panicked, and more… harmonized. It no longer sounded like a cry of pain. It just sounded wrong.",22,56
1q1ofjx,,"The pitch was way too low, there was little variation, almost soothing. It stayed like that- still trembling, as if fighting to get out of its own skin.",28,57
1q1ofjx,,"But regardless, its lungs filled, and it let out that same monotone call. I didn’t like what I was looking at. It made me sick.",25,58
1q1ofjx,,"It looked the same as someone overdosing, the way they lose control of their body, eyes wide as if looking for some way out of the comatose state.",28,59
1q1ofjx,,"It’s something I’d never wanted to see again, and there I was watching every single second of this thing losing control.",21,60
1q1ofjx,,I was so disgusted that I didn’t even realize the call it was making... it was starting to sound like the same hum I heard from within the tower.,29,61
1q1ofjx,,"I had every right to put it down, if anything it was my duty. It was suffering. But I couldn’t; I was frozen in place.",25,62
1q1ofjx,,"Looking into the desperate eyes of this animal terrified me. The longer I stood there, the more I felt a headache coming on; it sickened me.",26,63
1q1ofjx,,"I just wanted to get away from it, so that’s what I did.",13,64
1q1ofjx,,"As I left the call of that thing reminded me of my cowardice, growing fainter with every step but never fully going away.",23,65
1q1ofjx,,"It felt like the noise just stayed in my ear and refused to leave me, nor did the headache. After about another mile I finally approached the campsite.",28,66
1q1ofjx,,I expected to find a family or a group of friends.,11,67
1q1ofjx,,"I didn’t know what to expect, maybe they were disheveled by the crash, maybe they hadn’t even noticed it at all. But there was nothing.",25,68
1q1ofjx,,"I called out, stated that I was a park ranger, and that there was some ‘weird activity’ in the area.",20,69
1q1ofjx,,"(What the hell would you call it?) But I never got a response. There was a fire lit, tents pitched, and even some beer cans out with lawn chairs.",29,70
1q1ofjx,,There were people here. Where the fuck were they? I hesitated for a second. Walking onto the site felt like walking into a crime scene—like a moment frozen in history.,30,71
1q1ofjx,,"Despite that, I put one foot forward. “Hellooo?” I called out, my flashlight darted across every dark corner, hand over my holster.",22,72
1q1ofjx,,I approach the fire; its crackling being the only noise radiating in the silent woods. There was still something cooking in a pot; baked beans.,25,73
1q1ofjx,,"They looked fresh, only being a little bit burnt. I was barely holding it together; I was terrified. It’s not obvious, but I’ve gone through it.",26,74
1q1ofjx,,"Anyone that knows me and they’ll say I’m a tough bitch, but this mixed with the growing tension in my head was beginning to make me lose my cool.",29,75
1q1ofjx,,"I called out my identification louder, and surprisingly, I got a response. From within one of the tents I heard a groan. It was a person, probably hurt.",28,76
1q1ofjx,,I hustled to the tent and lifted the flap—my stomach dropped. Have you ever seen someone choking?,17,77
1q1ofjx,,"It’s the primal realization that you’re losing a resource needed to survive, and every animalistic instinct is working to get it back to you.",24,78
1q1ofjx,,The camper had ripped his jacket and undershirt open around his collar. His face had gone red and began turning purple.,21,79
1q1ofjx,,"His eyes were red and strained, locking in on me with pure anxiety. His teeth clenched then opened, trying to take deep breaths, but no air came through.",28,80
1q1ofjx,,"I started to step forward to help. His hands were clutched around his neck, almost looking like he was scratching at it.",22,81
1q1ofjx,,"But then I looked; his neck was grossly swollen like the deer’s. I stood terrified, I had no idea what to do.",22,82
1q1ofjx,,"But then, with all his might he was able to barely mutter, 

 

“Help…” 

 

Ignoring my own reasoning, I knelt down to the man and immediately started to tend to him.",30,83
1q1ofjx,,"“It’s okay, I’ve got you!” I said, I sounded confident, almost confident enough to convince myself I knew what to do.",21,84
1q1ofjx,,I held his arms down so that I could better inspect his throat.,13,85
1q1ofjx,,"It wasn’t just swollen… it was pulsing, as if something below his skin was warping and shifting, leaving him as a bystander.",22,86
1q1ofjx,,"I stared in disbelief, my guise of competence dropped. I grab my radio off my hip, “Fire watch Ed, copy!” 

 

“I’m here.",22,87
1q1ofjx,,"How’s it look- “ 

 

“Call emergency services to the D4 campsite NOW! There’s a man who’s asphyxiating, requiring immediate medical ai-“ 

 

I was cut off. I heard something.",28,88
1q1ofjx,,"It wasn’t the man; it wasn’t the fire… it was a hum. It was low, guttural, monotone and artificial, yet it came from something alive.",25,89
1q1ofjx,,"I shifted my weight, trying to listen closer. “Amanda, can you repeat? I’m getting some interference, over.” 

 

I clutch my radio and raise it up to my lips and whisper.",30,90
1q1ofjx,,"“Get rescue services here NOW. There’s something here.” 

 

The man across from me in the tent is still gasping for air—desperate, but silent. He had to wait.",27,91
1q1ofjx,,"I creep closer to the tent’s entrance and peek outside, carefully moving the tarp to peek through the fabric. It wasn’t a bear; I knew it wasn’t.",27,92
1q1ofjx,,"You’d hear a bear, the way it breathes, the weight of its body moving; this wasn’t that. It was just… a melancholic hum droning, constant and resonant.",27,93
1q1ofjx,,My heart dropped—it was worse than a bear.,8,94
1q1ofjx,,"On the other side of the fire I saw its outline, long and tan against the glow of the warm light; it was a mountain lion.",26,95
1q1ofjx,,"Bears were deadly in a direct sense. They overpower every animal in every way, but these are different. Big cats are menacing; they plan, they stalk, they think.",28,96
1q1ofjx,,Bears will kill you. Big cats know the best way to kill you.,13,97
1q1ofjx,,"I fell back on my ass, catching myself, making sure to cover my mouth before I could make a noise.",20,98
1q1ofjx,,It didn’t make sense though; it was making a noise—that hum—it should not be able to make that.,18,99
1q1ofjx,,"I tried to make sense of it, but my head was pounding, I could barely focus as it was. I grab my revolver out of the holster.",27,100
1q1ofjx,,I cock the hammer back and look out again. It wasn’t moving... it just stood there.,16,101
1q1ofjx,,"It appeared planted in one spot, but it was spasming; its limbs and back were trembling as if its nervous system were on fire. Despite that, it stood straight.",29,102
1q1ofjx,,"But I couldn’t see its head well past the fire. I didn’t have a clean shot. It just stood there, letting out that horrible, gross droning noise.",27,103
1q1ofjx,,The headache was getting worse; I felt a migraine coming on that made it hard to keep my eyes open. The stress was getting to me.,26,104
1q1ofjx,,"Regardless though, I kept my eyes locked on the beast, waiting for a clean shot. Suddenly, the man called out behind me.",22,105
1q1ofjx,,"I whipped my head around, and the strain was gone from his eyes; they looked empty.",16,106
1q1ofjx,,"Despite that, his lungs filled with air, and out his mouth came another groan, off and strained, but at the same pitch as the big cat.",26,107
1q1ofjx,,I whipped back around to look at the cat. It wasn’t by the fire.,14,108
1q1ofjx,,"I shifted my glance to the right, and I saw it there, standing no more than 5 feet from the tent.",21,109
1q1ofjx,,"It was shambling, sloppily putting one foot in front of the other. But it wasn’t right.",16,110
1q1ofjx,,"I don’t know what I saw, but it’s head… 

 

It looked like the skull of the animal was snapped backwards at the base of the neck, its top jaw just facing out.",32,111
1q1ofjx,,The lower jaw was just barely hanging on like a useless ligament.,12,112
1q1ofjx,,"The vocal cords and throat muscles of the beast had swollen and distorted, pushing grotesquely against the skin near where the head should be.",24,113
1q1ofjx,,In the throat cavity I could see the exposed larynx; it was jittering with the horrible humming that bellowed through the air.,22,114
1q1ofjx,,"It’s like this animal was taken and turned into a vessel, an instrument to play that horrible resonance.",18,115
1q1ofjx,,I was horrified—my head splitting to the point I felt my vision begin to blur. I didn’t know what to do. Was it even alive?,25,116
1q1ofjx,,"Would my gun even do anything? I tried to hold it up, but the pain in my skull kept me from being able to hold it straight.",27,117
1q1ofjx,,I stumbled back towards the man who was still attempting to call out and I grabbed him. It’s like he was ratting me out.,24,118
1q1ofjx,,"After getting behind him, I covered his mouth with my hand and tried to squeeze my arm around his throat.",20,119
1q1ofjx,,"I know it seemed counterproductive, but I had to silence him. The tent was still open though; the tarp just draped over the entrance.",24,120
1q1ofjx,,It was taking every fiber of my being to hold myself together.,12,121
1q1ofjx,,"The man’s body started convulsing as I held him, but I kept him quiet, holding back tears as the malformed cat approached the tent.",24,122
1q1ofjx,,"I could see its shadow approaching, backlit from the fire. Its paw pushed against the loose tarp; its claws fully extended, as if its entire body was contracted and flexed.",30,123
1q1ofjx,,"The hum was earsplitting now; I felt it in my head. It was in me, bouncing against the walls of my skull.",22,124
1q1ofjx,,"I couldn’t think, if anything, I felt myself falling apart. I couldn’t focus; I felt on the verge of passing out. But then, it stopped.",25,125
1q1ofjx,,The beast recoiled away from the tent and scurried off. As the sound of helicopter blades appearing overhead.,18,126
1q1ofjx,,"I leaned back, sobbing as the wave of relief washed over me—my arms still tense around the man’s body. We evacuated with the helicopter.",24,127
1q1ofjx,,They had the man on a stretcher to try to stabilize his condition while we rode to the nearest hospital. He doesn’t look great.,24,128
1q1ofjx,,"He was seizing for the entire ride. The EMT’s asked about anyone else, but I had no idea what’s happened to the rest of his party.",26,129
1q1ofjx,,"Once we got to the hospital, the doctors inspected him, and they were more confused than I was. His vitals were far from normal.",24,130
1q1ofjx,,"His heart was beating, he was breathing—but he was brain-dead. It made no sense; he just kept letting out that same fucking humming.",23,131
1q1ofjx,,"I was bombarded with a rigorous series of questions as to what happened, like I have any clue what just happened. And honestly, I feel like shit.",27,132
1q1ofjx,,My migraine has eased but only slightly and the sound of that fucking hum is still wrecking my head; it won’t go away.,23,133
1q1ofjx,,"Stay away from the woods; it’s not safe there. And please, for the love of God, stay away from anything that sounds like what I described.",26,134
1q1ofjx,,"There is something VERY WRONG out there. Please, if anyone has any idea what’s going on, I need to know. I feel my mind slipping.",25,135
1q1ofjx,,I need to know it’s going to be okay. I’m so scared.,12,136
1q1o4w3,My best friend will do anything for me... and I can't stop him.,I’ll never forget the day I met Alix.,8,0
1q1o4w3,,It’s not every day you meet someone who’ll change the entire course of your life right down to the cellular level… but I’m getting ahead of myself.,27,1
1q1o4w3,,"I don’t need to rush the story. These days, I quite literally have all the time in the world.",19,2
1q1o4w3,,"When Alix and I met, it was my first day at a new school in a new neighborhood: my family had moved in just before the semester started, and I, a scrawny first-grader with no confidence, was completely adrift in a strange place where everyone in my class seemed bigger than me.",52,3
1q1o4w3,,"No bullies had targeted me yet, but that was only because I was so low on the food chain that they hadn't even noticed me, and the same went for everyone else in class: they were too busy chatting about the big truck crash that had happened just outside school that morning.",52,4
1q1o4w3,,"I must’ve looked like I was about to start crying, because the teacher, Mrs Fuller, came to my rescue. “Alix? Alix Smythe?",22,5
1q1o4w3,,Could you be a lamb and look after Daniel?” she asked distractedly.,12,6
1q1o4w3,,"“My hands are a little full right now and I need someone who can be a friend to our new student. Take good care of him, won’t you?",28,7
1q1o4w3,,"Alix was a head taller than everyone in the class, with eyes so dark they seemed almost black, an eerily permanent smile, and an overall look I can only describe as ""androgynous."" A few of the snottier kids in class had picked on him for it, even cheekily asking about his pronouns, but Alix had only smiled, listening politely as the smartass remarks sailed past him without stirring so much as a ripple.",73,8
1q1o4w3,,"But then he heard Mrs Fuller’s orders, and suddenly Alix seemed to come alive for the first time in the entire day.",22,9
1q1o4w3,,"Snapping to attention, Alix threw an arm over my shoulder and said, “Glad to meet you, Daniel! I’m Alix.”

From then on, Alix was always there to help me.",29,10
1q1o4w3,,"If I needed help with my bag and textbooks between classrooms, Alix would carry them for me. If there was something in a lesson I’d missed, Alix wrote everything down.",30,11
1q1o4w3,,"If I got bored between lessons, Alix would clown around, coaxing laughter with his mimicries of teachers and kids.",19,12
1q1o4w3,,"If I was ever scared to brave the packed cafeteria, Alix would clear the way for me, somehow parting the crowds like Moses.",23,13
1q1o4w3,,"If the first-day fears got too much for me, Alix offered his shoulder for me to cry on and always gave the best hugs.",24,14
1q1o4w3,,"And when the bullies finally took notice, Alix was there to shield me.",13,15
1q1o4w3,,"But at the end of my first day, as Alix and I hurtled out through the school gates, I saw that alongside the usual army of parents there to pick up their kids, there were three men in nondescript grey suits and green ties standing on the edge of the parking lot.",52,16
1q1o4w3,,"All three stood out like sore thumbs, but they didn’t stick around to answer questions: as soon as they saw Alix, one of the men marched up, grabbed him by the shoulder, whispered a few words in his ear, and escorted him away before any of the other parents could react.",51,17
1q1o4w3,,"By the time the shock wore off, the other kids were already whispering that we’d never see Alix ever again.",20,18
1q1o4w3,,"And yet, when I went to bed that evening, Alix was waiting for me in my bedroom, leaning casually against the wall, none the worse for wear and still smiling, black eyes glittering like onyx.",35,19
1q1o4w3,,"“How did you get here?” I asked. “Who were those men who grabbed you? How did you get away from them?”

But Alix only shrugged.",25,20
1q1o4w3,,"“I was told to look after you, and here I am,” he said, as if it was the most obvious thing in the world.",24,21
1q1o4w3,,"“But don’t you have a home to go to? Don’t you have a mom and dad who’ll be missing you?”

Alix shook his head.",24,22
1q1o4w3,,"“They’re all in the ground,” he said. “Besides, I was told to look after you.",15,23
1q1o4w3,,"I belong with you.”

Had I been a little older, that would probably have been a red flag, but at the time, it simply didn’t click that there was anything weird about what Alix had said.",36,24
1q1o4w3,,"Instead, I blurted, “But I can’t just keep you here! What if Mom asks questions?”

“She won’t know I’m here.",20,25
1q1o4w3,,"I’ll hide here with you until it’s time for school.”

“Well… what if those guys in suits come after you again?”

Alix just smiled.",24,26
1q1o4w3,,"“They won’t find me.”

And then, without warning, he *changed*: his entire body shifted and flattened against the wall behind him, skin turning pale and sprouting huge fissures to blend in with the cracked plaster, until his face simply vanished into the cheap brickwork.",44,27
1q1o4w3,,"In a matter of seconds, he was perfectly disguised as just another section of the wall. Then, with another ripple of moment, he was a chair leaning against the wall.",30,28
1q1o4w3,,"Then over the next few seconds of changing, he was every student and teacher he'd met that day. Then they were me.",22,29
1q1o4w3,,"“I can there for you without anyone knowing about it,” said Alix, as he slowly returned to normal.",18,30
1q1o4w3,,"“I can be whatever you need me to be.”

They smiled again, wider than ever, until it seemed to spread across every inch of his face.",26,31
1q1o4w3,,If only I’d noticed that the smile didn’t reach his eyes. If only I’d noticed how *pained* that smile looked.,20,32
1q1o4w3,,"Of course, I asked questions about my new friend, but Alix rarely had the answers.",15,33
1q1o4w3,,"When I asked how old he was, he'd just say “old.”

When I asked where his parents were, all he'd say was “in the ground.”

When I asked where he was from, he'd only say, “Number 13.”

He couldn’t tell me anything about what he really was, how he could shapeshift, who the men in suits were, and why it was so important to look after me.",67,34
1q1o4w3,,"As far as I could tell, he didn’t know and didn’t care. And eventually, I didn’t either.",17,35
1q1o4w3,,"And once I realized how good my life could be with a shapeshifting best friend, I just accepted it. In other words, I learned to ignore the red flags.",29,36
1q1o4w3,,"So, Alix followed me to school next day, disguised as my backpack, and through the day, he kept me safe and contented in one disguise or another.",27,37
1q1o4w3,,"Meanwhile, the bullies spent the day tripping over things, slipping in puddles, accidentally stabbing themselves with pencils, and sometimes even finding worms in their sandwiches.",25,38
1q1o4w3,,"And when I went home to a house that was always cold, my parents were always out late, and the fridge was always empty, Alix was there to make things better.",31,39
1q1o4w3,,"He stole food for me, became a blanket to keep me warm, and if I was really miserable, he could shapeshift into my mother and act as if she actually cared.",31,40
1q1o4w3,,"While I slept, he sat in the dark on the other side of the room, watching.",16,41
1q1o4w3,,"If Mom or Dad were around, Alix took the form of any one of my toys, perfectly disguised just in case they decided to pay a rare visit.",28,42
1q1o4w3,,"At all other times, Alix was Alix, sitting in a chair across from my bed, black eyes fixed on me, his mouth frozen in a smile, teeth gleaming in the moonlight.",31,43
1q1o4w3,,"He never slept. He only watched, waiting to fulfil another need. And so, my life with Alix went on.",19,44
1q1o4w3,,"Every day, whether he was disguised as a bird in the sky, a stray dog, a substitute teacher, or even the desk in front of me, he made sure I was happy and safe, and every day, he made sure that anyone who tried to hurt me suffered.",48,45
1q1o4w3,,"Sad thing was, I didn’t realize how extreme things could get until Richie Payne stole my lunch money and turned up in a wheelchair the next day, too afraid to even look me in the eye.",36,46
1q1o4w3,,"Naturally, I asked why Alix had decided it was a good idea to shatter Riche’s kneecaps over a grand total of five dollars, but Alix would not be moved.",29,47
1q1o4w3,,"“He hurt you,” he said. “I hurt him back. Now he knows better.”

“But you can’t just go around hurting people like that,” I protested. “Why not?",27,48
1q1o4w3,,"It’s the only way they’ll be better.”

Alix smiled that same mirthless, tortured-looking smile. “Richie’s *better* now,” he said. “He’ll never hurt you again.",24,49
1q1o4w3,,"He’s out of your way.”

And nothing I said could dissuade him, not even when I tried to end our friendship.",21,50
1q1o4w3,,"My screamed temper-tantrum was ignored, as were my tears, my threats of somehow finding the men in the suits and making sure Alix was taken away for good this time, and even my order to leave and never come back.",40,51
1q1o4w3,,"Sure, Alix was devoted to me, would give his life to protect me if that was what it took, but he wasn't my servant or my slave, and he didn’t take orders from me.",34,52
1q1o4w3,,"*H*e set the rules, and the first and foremost one was that when it came to keeping me safe and happy, nothing was forbidden.",24,53
1q1o4w3,,"Whenever he met a kid who singled me out for abuse, he did everything he could to make the luckless bully pay, in whatever form was suited to the job.",30,54
1q1o4w3,,"And as the years went on, the same went for everyone who mistreated me in any way... or looked like they *might* mistreat me.",24,55
1q1o4w3,,Librarians who told me to be quiet were plagued with phantom screams all day.,14,56
1q1o4w3,,Doctors who asked me to wait were forced to see me first by mystery assailants that they could never identify to the police.,23,57
1q1o4w3,,Gym teachers who’d been hard on me suddenly found their cars stolen.,12,58
1q1o4w3,,Rivals in competitions were unexpectedly sabotaged – from the sprinter who tripped up just a couple of feet from the finish line to the guitarist who had to drop out after having his hands broken in a “mugging” gone wrong.,40,59
1q1o4w3,,"And as I began making my way through high school, girls I liked found themselves suffering plagues of bad luck until they agreed to my request for a date.",29,60
1q1o4w3,,"Nothing I told Alix could make him change tactics. He just didn’t understand why hurting people who didn’t like me was wrong. So, eventually, I stopped trying to convince him.",30,61
1q1o4w3,,"Sure, I was guilty, maybe even a little scared, but the benefits were just too good to give up on.",20,62
1q1o4w3,,"So, little by little, I accepted his way of doing things. I even enjoyed it. Strange as it seems, I liked Alix.",22,63
1q1o4w3,,"He was my best friend, after all… though truth be told, he was my *only* friend.",16,64
1q1o4w3,,"Maybe it was inevitable, since my parents were barely around long enough to cook dinner, most of the other kids were too scared of me to be real friends, and by the time I got around to graduating from high school, most girls tended to avoid me as well, especially after what happened to the last girlfriend who’d gotten on Alix’s bad side.",63,65
1q1o4w3,,"So, Alix became the perfect friend for every occasion, and I do mean *every* occasion.",15,66
1q1o4w3,,"It still makes me laugh to know that nobody was able to identify the girl I took to my senior prom; considering how many women Alix chose to sample and mimic to get that form just right, he was very proud of himself...",43,67
1q1o4w3,,"though if that day taught me anything, it's that things like gender and sex don't mean much to a shapeshifter.",20,68
1q1o4w3,,"The only reason why I still call Alix ""he"" and ""him"" is out of habit. Years went by.",18,69
1q1o4w3,,"I got a part-time job for a little experience and money, made it through college, moved to a different state, entered the corporate world, claimed a plum starting job in a very prestigious company, and began climbing the career ladder.",40,70
1q1o4w3,,"Meanwhile, Alix stole and laundered the money needed to pay my debts, got me the “materials” needed for my essays, sabotaged better-qualified rivals for jobs, took out contenders for promotion who might outdo me, and made sure I knew who best to impress on the road to success.",48,71
1q1o4w3,,"Sometimes, he even gave me a nice car to impress my boss with – or rather, he *became* a nice car to impress my boss with.",26,72
1q1o4w3,,Nobody noticed the pitch-black headlights or the teeth behind the grille.,11,73
1q1o4w3,,"As the fight for promotion grew fiercer, some of my more prominent rivals at work simply disappeared entirely, usually after suffering nervous breakdowns: one, Jason Beagle, managed to get himself fired and underwent a very rapid descent into alcoholism to the point of public nudity before he finally vanished.",49,74
1q1o4w3,,"To this day, I have no idea if Alix engineered their breakdowns or simply impersonated them and acted out the breakdowns, and I don’t know how many of those rivals were buried in shallow graves or flung into the ocean to put the finishing touches on Alix’s sabotage.",48,75
1q1o4w3,,"And of course, when I asked, all Alix would say was that the missing rivals were “better now,” and smile that same tormented-looking smile.",24,76
1q1o4w3,,"But after a severed finger with Jason Beagle’s signet ring washed up on a beach less than half an hour’s walk from my new apartment, I knew for a fact that Alix was now a murderer.",36,77
1q1o4w3,,"And I didn’t care. Had it happened any earlier, I might have panicked, called the police, or maybe even tried to seek out the men in suits.",27,78
1q1o4w3,,"Perhaps, had I been wise enough, I might have even feared that my faithful friend might one day turn on me in a fit of jealousy.",26,79
1q1o4w3,,"But after so many years of benefiting from Alix’s talent for subterfuge and violence, a few deaths to catapult me to the top of the pyramid were acceptable losses.",29,80
1q1o4w3,,"Murder was just my friend’s way of doing what was best for me, and after so many years of having the best things in life because of Alix, who was I to say no to him?",36,81
1q1o4w3,,"With my shapeshifting best friend steering my life, there was nowhere to go but up…

Or so I thought.",19,82
1q1o4w3,,"In hindsight, I’d always secretly worried that something might transpire outside Alix’s control, that one day my decades-long lucky streak would finally run out, and sure enough, it happened at the tender age of thirty-five.",35,83
1q1o4w3,,"It started with a stubborn cough that refused to leave, a wild clenching spasm in my chest that left me doubled over for minutes on end, wheezing for breath.",29,84
1q1o4w3,,"Then the terrible moments where I seemed to have no breath at all, where it took all my strength to force air into my lungs.",25,85
1q1o4w3,,"Then, finally, the telltale spots of blood on my lips when I coughed.",13,86
1q1o4w3,,"Alix naturally got me the very best medical care, even if it meant travelling hundreds of miles away from me to threaten world-famous oncologists into taking charge of my case.",30,87
1q1o4w3,,"But in the end, it didn’t matter how much money he stole for the treatments, nor did it matter who Alix bribed and bullied into reviewing my condition.",28,88
1q1o4w3,,"The diagnosis remained the same. Lung cancer, stage 4. I was given a life expectancy of less than a year, maybe a little more with chemo.",26,89
1q1o4w3,,"The doctors unlucky enough to meet him told Alix to help me set my affairs in order, perhaps believing that he was my spouse or lover.",26,90
1q1o4w3,,"Well, Alix loved me, that much was true. He loved me with an intensity and devotion that would terrify any rational mind unlucky enough to observe his excesses.",28,91
1q1o4w3,,"And as I was to learn in the following days, that was what had been intended from the very beginning.",20,92
1q1o4w3,,"And that was why, when doctors recommended sending me away to a highly exclusive private clinic, Alix reacted very badly.",20,93
1q1o4w3,,"Going to this particular clinic would have meant being kept in strict isolation for drastic therapies that could damage my immune system, and even though Alix would have easily followed, the thought of him potentially harming me even by accident was too much for him to bear.",47,94
1q1o4w3,,"So, while I was signing the transfer papers, Alix added a little something extra to my IV bag.",18,95
1q1o4w3,,"Before I had time to figure out what was going on, I was already passing out. I awoke to find myself in unfamiliar surroundings.",24,96
1q1o4w3,,"The luxury apartment that I had bought with Alix’s laundered cash was gone, replaced by a vast sprawling complex of rough concrete halls, magnetically sealed doors, still-functioning generators, a mile of laboratories, and enough filing cabinets to fill the Library of Congress.",42,97
1q1o4w3,,"As I eventually discovered, Alix had taken me to an abandoned military research base somewhere under the deserts of Nevada.",20,98
1q1o4w3,,"The facility had obviously been abandoned in the wake of huge battle, for the place was littered with spent casings, cratered from grenades, scorched from flame throwers, and littered with decades-old corpses.",32,99
1q1o4w3,,"Also, most of the doors had been welded shut from the outside, all except the one that Alix had torn open to get me down here.",26,100
1q1o4w3,,But it wasn’t until I found the trio of skeletons dressed in those distinctive grey suits and green ties that I finally realized exactly where we were.,27,101
1q1o4w3,,This was Alix’s home. Research Station Number 13.,8,102
1q1o4w3,,"According to the various papers and video footage left around the complex, the scientists here had been experimenting on a shapeshifting creature they’d found sleeping deep underground, one of an entire species of polymorphs that hadn’t seen the light of day since the end of the Permian Period.",48,103
1q1o4w3,,"They'd been lucky enough to find these creatures during a period of dormancy, and though they'd only been able to claim one specimen out of untold thousands before safety issues had forced them to close their dig site, that was all they needed.",43,104
1q1o4w3,,"The project researchers had found a way to permanently trigger the areas of the polymorph brain relating to infatuation, conditioning the shapeshifter into a loving bodyguard to one individual at a time.",32,105
1q1o4w3,,"By nature, it would be capable of blending in anywhere, serving as body double to anyone, killing anyone who threatened its master, and thanks to the conditioning, its absolute loyalty would be guaranteed to whoever it had been ordered to protect… except in those moments where the conditioning slipped just enough for the horror to show in the bodyguard’s smile.",60,106
1q1o4w3,,"And to make their ownership official, the scientists had given the new bodyguard a name.",15,107
1q1o4w3,,"The Brass had grand plans on making Alix a gift for the President… but unfortunately, the truck that was carrying him crashed before it could be delivered to Washington and programmed.",31,108
1q1o4w3,,"With his handlers dead in the crash and no idea what else to do, Alix had blended in: he made his way to the school across the road, forged a few records, adjusted his default form to match the local demographics, and enrolled himself in a class while he waited to be retrieved.",53,109
1q1o4w3,,"And then Mrs Fuller had ordered Alix to look after me, unwittingly programming him to serve as my bodyguard from then on.",22,110
1q1o4w3,,"When the grey-suited handlers had arrived to return Alix to the base for reprogramming, my new bodyguard had complied… right up until his keepers let it slip that Alix wouldn’t be allowed to see me again.",36,111
1q1o4w3,,"That was when Alix had started killing: he'd killed the three handlers, the security guards assisting them, the marines sent in as reinforcements, the scientists who could reprogram him, and finally, the base commander, along with anyone trying to activate the self-destruct sequence.",43,112
1q1o4w3,,He'd even dismantled the bomb behind the self-destruct. He hadn’t stopped killing until everyone else had evacuated and Alix had the entire base to himself.,25,113
1q1o4w3,,"And then he'd returned to my side. For nearly three decades, Alix had been my friend: he'd protected me, fed me, entertained me, comforted me, served my ambitions...",28,114
1q1o4w3,,"…and now, with the threat of losing me forever on the horizon, he'd brought me to his home to guarantee my survival on a *permanent* basis.",26,115
1q1o4w3,,"As soon as I figured that out, I tried to flee for the exit that Alix had unlocked, but he caught me halfway there.",24,116
1q1o4w3,,"Before I could stop him, he'd reached out with a tendril and burrowed into my spine, pouring a liquid piece of himself into my flesh, transfusing me with his cells, altering me from the inside out.",36,117
1q1o4w3,,"The pain was incredible, like drowning in molten lead, my entire body contorting in pain as my skin bubbled and hissed, my bones softening and warping beneath my liquescent flesh, until even my skull seemed to implode, before I finally lost consciousness.",42,118
1q1o4w3,,"When I awoke, I was lying on a bed in the deserted lab, Alix smiling down at me. ""You're *better* now,"" he purred. Sure enough, the cancer was gone.",29,119
1q1o4w3,,"The terrible shortness of breath, the endless coughing, the bloody spittle, and the clawing pain in my lungs, all had been washed away by my best friend’s transfusion.",28,120
1q1o4w3,,"Unfortunately, that wasn't the only thing I'd lost.",8,121
1q1o4w3,,"I wasn’t a true shapeshifter, and probably won't be for decades, but I could tell at once that I wasn’t human anymore, and anyone who cared to look would see it in my lightless black eyes, grey-tinted skin, and long, swirling, tendril-like fingers.",43,122
1q1o4w3,,"Alix had cured my cancer, but he'd also made certain I’d have no choice but to stay with him forever… and given that he and the rest of his family have been alive for more than two hundred and fifty million years, that could very well be the case.",49,123
1q1o4w3,,"It’s been more than twenty years since that day, and I haven’t aged for any of it.",17,124
1q1o4w3,,"Alix regularly sneaks off to the surface to steal food and luxuries to make my stay down here more bearable, including the computer that I’m typing this confession on and the Wi-Fi connection I’m using to send it out into the world.",42,125
1q1o4w3,,"I’m not a prisoner. There’s nothing stopping me from leaving, except for the fact that I’d be hunted down by government agents and dissected in another laboratory.",27,126
1q1o4w3,,"Perhaps one day, I’ll have changed enough to shapeshift and play at being human again… but I doubt I’ll ever be willing to leave.",24,127
1q1o4w3,,"In truth, I stay because I know it’s what I deserve. Of all the years Alix had served me, I’d protested his atrocities for maybe *one*.",26,128
1q1o4w3,,"I’d left a trail of corpses and broken people on my path to success. I’d given up on love, accepting dates with victims of coercion and a brainwashed slave.",29,129
1q1o4w3,,"I’d let Alix help me cheat my way through school, through college, and all the way up the career ladder. And I'd loved him for it.",26,130
1q1o4w3,,I’d been a monster all along.,6,131
1q1o4w3,,"Alix had just made it official, even given me an underground lair of my very own to lurk in for all eternity, complete with a fellow monster grinning at me in the darkness.",33,132
1q1o4w3,,But that’s not why I’m writing this.,7,133
1q1o4w3,,"I’m writing this because I know that the project staff didn’t leave this base empty-handed: during Alix's rampage, someone was faxing all the documentation off-site.",25,134
1q1o4w3,,"*Someone* out there still knows where the rest of those ancient polymorphs sleep and how to control them… and though it’s too late for me, I’m hoping that one of you can somehow stop another Alix from being created.",39,135
1q1o4w3,,"I don’t want them destroyed, if they even can be. I just want them left alone, before some idiot tries to tame another one with even worse results.",28,136

The funny thing is that, as stupid as this girl is, there’s a certain sadness in her voice, like she knows the truth but *chooses* to be dumb.",34,8

“Of course.”

We come to a stop at a red light and I stare directly into his sunglasses.",29,27

“I can always hire someone else.” He laughs and puts his hands behind his head.",26,28

I act like I’m genuinely curious—impressed even.",13,29

“It’s no wonder you're such a success.”

He doesn’t catch my sarcasm.",20,31

“Uh-huh.”

Neither of us speak for a while, but every time I look at her in the rear view mirror I can see that she’s smiling.",46,37

“But a lot of things are,” she pauses for a second, opens her mouth and then closes it, as if debating whether or not to tell me a secret.",43,39

I keep talking until we reach his destination; he’s reaching for the door long before I come to a stop.",37,56

1q1lwsc,,"He barely acknowledges me until I drive past his destination. “Hey,” he says. “You missed my turn.”

I press harder on the gas.",23,62

I tell him that I’m going to the moon for Christmas. “I’m calling the police,” he says.",28,63
1q1lwsc,,"“This is ridiculous. You’re insane.”

But we’re already on my favorite backroad. As I’m pulling over I take a knife from my pocket and stab him in the stomach.",29,64
1q1lwsc,,I do it again and again until I’m sure he’s no longer breathing. I take his phone and use his face to unlock it.,24,65
1q1lwsc,,"I dump him in a ditch and drive back to his destination, a sleazy bar.",15,66

1q1lv0r,,"It slicked over the cracked sidewalks and leaned against the dead windows of the old factory district, blurring the streetlights into pale coins.",23,1
1q1lv0r,,"By nine o’clock the town felt underwater, every sound muted except the occasional hiss of a passing car and the distant horn of a freight train that never seemed to get any closer

I stood in the middle of Harrow Street with my hands stuffed into my hoodie, listening to my friends’ shoes crunch on broken glass behind me.",59,2
1q1lv0r,,"We’d been drinking cheap beer at Nico’s place, watching horror movies with the volume cranked up, when Jonah told us the story. The Candle Man.",25,3
1q1lv0r,,The name stuck in my head like a splinter and just kept digging. “Last chance to bail” I said without turning around. Casey snorted beside me.,26,4
1q1lv0r,,"“You say that like we’re gonna let you go into the death factory alone.”

Nico, shorter than the rest of us and swallowed by his denim jacket, jogged up until he was in step on my other side.",38,5
1q1lv0r,,"“Also, you still owe me for the beer.",8,6
1q1lv0r,,"If you die, your mom’s not paying me back.”

Mara walked a few steps behind, the only one smart enough to bring a flashlight.",24,7
1q1lv0r,,"The beam cut through the fog in a dull cone, sliding over boarded windows and rusted doors.",17,8
1q1lv0r,,"She hadn’t said much since we left, but I could feel her eyes on my back every time I slowed down. “You sure it’s this way?” she asked.",28,9
1q1lv0r,,"“Old Harrow Foundry?” Nico said. “Yeah. Just keep going toward the smell of tetanus and disappointment.”

I forced a laugh.",20,10
1q1lv0r,,"The foundry—what was left of it—had sat at the edge of town for over a century, a brick skeleton sinking into the riverbank where kids went to spray-paint their names and scare each other with dares.",36,11
1q1lv0r,,But tonight it felt less like a hangout and more like a destination.,13,12
1q1lv0r,,"Jonah had been wiping his hands on a rag in his dad’s garage when he told us, the air thick with oil and dust.",24,13
1q1lv0r,,A guy from his brother’s crew had gone up to the foundry one night last year. He came back without his little sister. Told the cops she ran off.,29,14
1q1lv0r,,"But when he got drunk, the story changed: a tall figure in the fog, a candle burning in its skull, a scream like a blown-out speaker, and then she was just gone.",32,15
1q1lv0r,,"“Urban legend,” Nico had said. But Jonah hadn’t argued. He’d just gone quiet in that way that made the hairs on my arms stand up.",25,16
1q1lv0r,,"That silence is what made me say, “What if we just go see?”

Now, slogging through the fog, I wished I’d kept my mouth shut.",25,17
1q1lv0r,,We turned off Harrow Street onto the narrow road that dropped toward the river. The asphalt was chewed up and patched so many times it looked scabbed.,27,18
1q1lv0r,,"On the right, chain-link fencing sagged under dead vines; on the left, the ground fell away to the black water below, the river barely visible where Mara’s light skimmed its skin.",31,19
1q1lv0r,,"“God, it’s like Silent Hill,” Casey muttered. “Minus the budget.”

“Hey,” Nico said, “we had exactly enough budget for a twelve-pack and two bags of chips.",26,20
1q1lv0r,,"Show some respect.”

I didn’t answer. A shape was rising out of the fog ahead—wide and low and broken at the top. What was left of the Harrow Foundry.",29,21
1q1lv0r,,"Up close, it looked worse than I remembered. The roof was mostly gone, leaving only rusted beams and jagged stretches of wall. The main entrance was choked with rubble.",29,22
1q1lv0r,,"Half-buried in the debris was a metal sign that read HARROW TAL—RY, the missing letters like teeth knocked out of a grin. Empty windows stared blackly, edged with broken glass.",30,23
1q1lv0r,,"Across one wall someone had spray-painted NO GOD HERE in dripping letters. “Cheery,” Casey said. Mara’s beam crossed a bent chain-link gate.",22,24
1q1lv0r,,"A plastic warning sign, once bright, was faded almost white: DANGER. KEEP OUT. “So naturally,” Nico said, “we go in.”

We squeezed past the edge of the gate.",28,25
1q1lv0r,,"Inside the yard, the gravel was uneven, puddles of black water reflecting distant streetlights.",14,26
1q1lv0r,,"The air smelled like wet rust and something sour underneath, as if a century of smoke and fat had soaked into the ground and never left.",26,27
1q1lv0r,,"“Okay,” I said, trying to sound casual. “We hit the main floor, snap a few pics, then bounce. Post ‘em.",20,28
1q1lv0r,,"Laugh at Jonah for being dramatic.”

“And if we see him?” Casey asked. “See who?” Nico said. Casey rolled his eyes. “The Candle Dude.",24,29
1q1lv0r,,"Mister Wax Skull.”

My throat felt dry. “Then we finally get you the TikTok fame you’ve been begging for.”

Mara stopped walking.",22,30
1q1lv0r,,"Her light had landed on a narrow stairwell that sank into the building’s side. The concrete steps were cracked, the banister rusted into lacy holes.",25,31
1q1lv0r,,"Above the stairwell, someone had painted a crude candle, yellow drips running down its sides, a red pool at the base. “Basement,” she said. “Hard pass,” Nico said immediately.",29,32
1q1lv0r,,"“Basement,” I repeated. “The story said he came from below. From the vats.”

Casey stared at me.",17,33
1q1lv0r,,"“That story also said ‘never go looking for him,’ genius.”

Maybe it was the beer. Maybe it was the fog.",20,34
1q1lv0r,,"Maybe it was Jonah’s face when he mentioned his brother’s friend—the way his expression went slack, like something inside him was sinking. Whatever it was, I felt pulled.",28,35
1q1lv0r,,"“We go down,” I said. “Real quick. Just to say we did.”

Mara looked like she wanted to argue, then just shook her head.",24,36
1q1lv0r,,"“I’m not staying up here alone.”

Nico muttered something about bad decisions and early funerals, but he followed as I started down.",22,37
1q1lv0r,,The steps groaned under our weight and shed little flakes of concrete with every footfall.,15,38
1q1lv0r,,"The fog thinned as we descended, replaced by a wet chill that seeped through my shoes and into my bones.",20,39
1q1lv0r,,"Mara’s light, strong up top, seemed to shrink and weaken, swallowed by the dark like a match. “I hate this,” Nico whispered behind me.",24,40
1q1lv0r,,"At the bottom, the stairs opened into a wide room.",10,41
1q1lv0r,,The ceiling was low and crisscrossed with rusted pipes; from them hung thick drips of old wax turned gray with age.,21,42
1q1lv0r,,"The floor was a patchwork of cracked concrete and open pits filled with shadow. Against one wall loomed massive vats, their rims crusted with hardened, pale layers.",27,43
1q1lv0r,,"“Okay, that’s…gross,” Casey said. “Is that…?”

“Old tallow,” Mara answered quietly. “Rendered fat.",13,44
1q1lv0r,,"They used to make candles from animal fat, sometimes even from—”

“Please don’t finish that sentence,” Nico cut in. I walked toward one of the vats.",26,45
1q1lv0r,,"Mara’s beam slid over the rim, catching an uneven surface of bubbles and drips, and here and there a darker stain that made my stomach twist.",26,46
1q1lv0r,,"I imagined someone falling in, screaming, bones boiling. I shook the image away. “All right, we saw the vats,” Nico said, his voice a little too high.",27,47
1q1lv0r,,"“We did the thing. Can we leave before we catch a ghost-borne disease?”

A faint clink froze us. It sounded like glass tapping glass.",24,48
1q1lv0r,,"Mara snapped the beam in that direction. The room looked empty. “What was that?” Casey whispered. “Probably just…something settling,” I said, but my voice sounded thin even to me. Clink.",30,49
1q1lv0r,,"Louder this time, followed by a soft, dry rattle that sounded like teeth chattering.",14,50
1q1lv0r,,"The light caught a piece of chain swinging slowly from a beam near the far wall, as if someone had just brushed past it. Mara’s hand shook.",27,51
1q1lv0r,,"“That wasn’t the wind. There is no wind down here.”

Nico took a step toward the stairs. “Okay, nope. I’m out. We saw the vats. We heard the haunted chain.",30,52
1q1lv0r,,"Ten out of ten, leaving now.”

The air felt tight in my lungs. The room was holding its breath. “We came for proof,” I said. “A picture at least.",29,53
1q1lv0r,,"Otherwise Jonah’s just gonna say we were too scared to really look.”

“Jonah isn’t here,” Casey said sharply. “We are.",20,54
1q1lv0r,,"And whatever made that sound is also here.”

I opened my mouth to argue, but a new sound rolled through the dark and turned everything in my body to glass.",30,55
1q1lv0r,,"It started low, a vibration in my ribs, like somebody had turned on a huge amp in the next room.",20,56
1q1lv0r,,"Then it shot upward, jagged and brutal, into a screaming feedback shriek that ripped the air apart.",17,57
1q1lv0r,,"It didn’t sound like a voice; it sounded like a recording of a scream played too loud through a blown-out speaker, chopped into uneven clips and thrown at us all at once.",32,58
1q1lv0r,,"“Jesus!” Nico yelled, clapping his hands over his ears. Mara dropped the flashlight. It hit the floor and spun, tossing wild slices of light across the room.",27,59
1q1lv0r,,"The vats leapt in and out of view like tall, hunched figures. “Upstairs!” Casey shouted. We ran.",17,60
1q1lv0r,,My foot slipped on the first step and I smashed into the wall with both hands.,16,61
1q1lv0r,,"The flashlight beam whipped wildly, then stopped, pinning itself on something that hadn’t been there a second before. Something standing in the middle of the room. “Don’t…move,” Mara whispered.",29,62
1q1lv0r,,"The screech faded into a hiss of static, like someone slowly turning a volume knob down. My own heartbeat hammered in my ears.",23,63
1q1lv0r,,"The figure was tall and narrow, its shoulders hunched. Strings of what looked like wax and tendon hung from its arms and ribs, dripping but never quite hitting the floor.",30,64
1q1lv0r,,"Its body was stretched thin, the spine a sharp ridge under sagging remnants of clothes fused with hardened drips. The head was worse.",23,65
1q1lv0r,,"It was a half-melted skull, bone and wax collapsed together, eye sockets hollow tunnels.",14,66
1q1lv0r,,"From a crater in the top rose a single pale candle, perfectly straight, its sides ridged with old drips.",19,67
1q1lv0r,,"The flame burned a sickly yellow-white, too bright for this much darkness, yet it cast only a tight cone of light on the floor.",24,68
1q1lv0r,,"Smoke curled from it, but instead of rising it slid downward, coiling around the thing’s head like a slow, dirty halo. The Candle Man.",24,69
1q1lv0r,,"I didn’t want to name it, but my brain did it anyway. It moved. It didn’t lumber.",17,70
1q1lv0r,,"It stepped—long, quick, like it was always on the edge of falling and catching itself at the last instant.",19,71
1q1lv0r,,"Its knees bowed inward, wrong, making each stride look broken yet horribly efficient.",13,72
1q1lv0r,,"With its first step, it snapped its head down as if staring at its own feet, lowering the candle so its narrow light swept over the floor.",27,73
1q1lv0r,,"The beam slid over Mara’s dropped flashlight, over Nico’s shoes, over my hand on the wall. Wherever it passed, our shadows misbehaved.",22,74
1q1lv0r,,"They stretched tall and thin, separating from us, headless, each crowned with a tiny flickering candle on the stump of the neck. “Don’t look at it,” Mara gasped.",28,75
1q1lv0r,,"“Don’t—”

The Candle Man screamed again. This time the sound felt like it exploded inside my skull.",17,76
1q1lv0r,,"It was that same blown-out feedback, but chopped into rapid bursts, as if someone were flicking a switch on and off, on and off.",24,77
1q1lv0r,,"The pipes overhead rattled so hard dust rained down like gray snow. My teeth buzzed. Nico scrambled up the stairs, half climbing, half crawling.",24,78
1q1lv0r,,"Casey grabbed his arm and hauled him higher. “Move, Evan!” Casey yelled. “Go!”

I tried. My legs were heavy, filled with slow liquid heat like melted wax.",27,79
1q1lv0r,,"The candle’s light swept forward, and my shadow peeled away from my feet again.",14,80
1q1lv0r,,"I watched it stretch along the wall, its head dissolving, a stubby candle burning at the stump.",17,81
1q1lv0r,,"I could feel something tugging at that flat, wrong shape and, through it, tugging at me. Mara slammed into my side and grabbed my arm so hard I yelped.",29,82
1q1lv0r,,The pain was enough. We charged up the stairs. Nico was almost at the top. Mara was just ahead of me.,21,83
1q1lv0r,,"Casey stayed at my shoulder, breathing hard, muttering, “Nonononono,” under his breath like a prayer. The candlelight slid over our feet again. I saw both shadows: mine and Casey’s.",29,84
1q1lv0r,,"Both stretched, both lost their heads. Mine snapped back to normal with a sick shudder. Casey’s didn’t.",17,85
1q1lv0r,,"It froze in that headless shape, the little candle on its stump burning steady. The Candle Man screamed. The chopped bursts smashed into the stairwell like physical blows.",28,86
1q1lv0r,,The rusted railing rattled and then tore away from the wall. Casey had one hand on it. Suddenly he had nothing. He pitched backward with a strangled cry.,28,87
1q1lv0r,,"I grabbed for him, fingers brushing his sleeve, but the scream felt like it shoved him down, like the sound itself had hands.",23,88
1q1lv0r,,"He tumbled, hit the landing, and slid to a stop at the Candle Man’s feet. “Casey!” Nico yelled from above, voice breaking.",22,89
1q1lv0r,,"The Candle Man bowed low, like it was examining a broken toy. The candle dipped close to Casey’s face.",19,90
1q1lv0r,,"In that tight circle of light, I saw his eyes wide and unfocused, his lips moving soundlessly. His shadow lay pinned beneath him, still headless, its little candle flickering.",29,91
1q1lv0r,,"For one horrible second, the creature just stared, like a man checking a wick. Then its jaw opened.",18,92
1q1lv0r,,Where a tongue should have been there was a roped mass of half-melted wax and pale spikes like tallow teeth. It lowered that maw to Casey’s chest.,27,93
1q1lv0r,,"The scream that came next wasn’t the Candle Man’s. It was Casey’s—but shredded, chopped, and blown out in an instant, ripped from his throat and fed straight into the creature.",30,94
1q1lv0r,,"The sound cut off in the middle like someone had hit stop. Casey’s body jerked once, then went limp.",19,95
1q1lv0r,,"A thin thread of molten wax slid from the Candle Man’s mouth into his, sealing his lips in a pale line. “We have to go,” Mara said, voice raw.",29,96
1q1lv0r,,"She yanked my arm. Everything in me wanted to go down instead of up, to drag Casey away from that narrowing cone of light.",24,97
1q1lv0r,,"But the Candle Man was already straightening to its full height, the candle in its skull flaring brighter, as if it had been fed.",24,98
1q1lv0r,,"Its head angled toward the stairs, the candlelight reaching for us. I turned and ran. I don’t remember exactly how I got up the rest of the steps.",28,99
1q1lv0r,,"I only remember the slam of them under my shoes, Nico’s ragged sobs somewhere ahead, Mara’s grip bruising my arm.",20,100
1q1lv0r,,"Then we were bursting back into the open fog, leaving Casey’s body in the dark below, lying in a pool of light that didn’t belong to him anymore.",28,101
1q1lv0r,,We tore across the yard. Gravel slid under my feet.,10,102
1q1lv0r,,"Behind us, I heard the wet, even slap of the Candle Man’s steps—too fast, too regular, like a metronome someone had set to “panic.”

We squeezed through the gap in the fence.",32,103
1q1lv0r,,"On the road, the streetlights floated in the fog like pale halos, humming softly. “Car!” Nico gasped. “We need the car!”

We’d parked three blocks up near the corner store.",30,104
1q1lv0r,,"It might as well have been miles. Casey would’ve made a joke there, I realized, some crack about cardio or haunted Uber rides. The absence hit like a punch.",29,105
1q1lv0r,,We ran uphill. My lungs burned. I risked a look back.,11,106
1q1lv0r,,"At first there was only fog, then a thin, searching cone of light near the ground, jittering as it moved. The Candle Man had reached the road.",27,107
1q1lv0r,,"It moved faster here, those bowed knees almost touching as it strode uphill, head still bowed so the candle lit each step.",22,108
1q1lv0r,,It reminded me of someone who couldn’t walk unless they could see exactly where their feet fell—like the light was a track and it was stuck on it.,28,109
1q1lv0r,,"It screamed again. The blown-out screech leapt ahead of it, rattling the metal of the lampposts.",16,110
1q1lv0r,,"One of the bulbs flickered, buzzed, and then went out, leaving a black patch in the fog. “We’re leading it right under the lights!” Nico shouted.",26,111
1q1lv0r,,"My brain grabbed onto a piece of Jonah’s story. The Candle Man was drawn to candles in windows, to lone flames after midnight—drawn to light, both his and ours.",29,112
1q1lv0r,,"“If it needs light,” I panted, “we need the opposite.”

“What, a cave?” Nico said. I skidded to a stop beside a lamppost.",23,113
1q1lv0r,,"At its base, half-hidden by weeds and trash, was a metal service box. “Evan!” Mara shouted.",16,114
1q1lv0r,,"“What are you doing?”

“Help me open this!”

I dropped to my knees and clawed at the lid. Rust flaked under my nails.",23,115
1q1lv0r,,Mara jammed the edge of her flashlight between the lid and the box and pried. The metal shrieked. The lid jumped up an inch.,24,116
1q1lv0r,,"I got my fingers under it and wrenched it open. Inside was a small breaker panel with a row of switches labeled in fading marker: H‑1, H‑2, H‑3.",28,117
1q1lv0r,,"A cheery yellow sticker on the door read CITY PROPERTY – DO NOT TAMPER. The Candle Man screamed again, closer. The lamppost above us flickered. “Which one?” Mara said.",29,118
1q1lv0r,,"“All of them!” Nico yelled. I grabbed every switch I could reach and slammed them down. Something thunked inside the pole. The light overhead sputtered, dimmed, then went out.",29,119
1q1lv0r,,"Down the hill, other lamps tied to the same line dropped one by one, darkness blooming along Harrow Street like a spreading stain. For a second, everything went very quiet.",30,120
1q1lv0r,,"Then the Candle Man shrieked. In the sudden near-black, the candle in its skull flared, brightening its little cone— but there were no other lights now.",26,121
1q1lv0r,,"No streetlights, no glowing windows, just the fog and that single, quivering beam. The darkness beyond its reach looked thicker, almost solid. It hesitated. The long legs stuttered.",28,122
1q1lv0r,,"Its bowed head turned in small, jerky arcs, the candle describing a twitchy circle of light on the wet pavement, as if it were searching for paths that had been erased.",31,123
1q1lv0r,,"“It’s confused,” Mara whispered. “Good,” Nico said. “Let’s confuse it from very far away.”

We should have just run then, but I couldn’t look away.",25,124
1q1lv0r,,"In that moment, the Candle Man didn’t look like a hunter. It looked lost—like someone trapped in a hallway of their own memories with all the doors bricked up.",29,125
1q1lv0r,,"“It only knows where to go if there’s light to tell it,” Mara said quietly.",15,126
1q1lv0r,,"“Maybe the foundry was the last place it saw, back when everything was fire and lamps and burning fat.",19,127
1q1lv0r,,"Take away the rest and it’s just…stuck.”

Casey’s face flashed behind my eyes. His shadow, pinned and headless. The thin line of wax sealing his mouth. “Come on,” I said.",30,128
1q1lv0r,,"My throat hurt. “We’re not losing anyone else.”

We slipped away along the darker side of the street, keeping well clear of the candle’s circle.",25,129
1q1lv0r,,The Candle Man took no notice.,6,130
1q1lv0r,,"Its frantic stride had become a slow, searching shuffle, the bowed knees almost brushing as it traced small loops on the asphalt, caught in some pattern only it understood.",29,131
1q1lv0r,,"By the time we reached the brighter part of town, the sound of its broken screeches had shrunk to a thin, glitchy whine in the distance.",26,132
1q1lv0r,,"At the corner, the streetlights hummed steadily. Neon from the corner store painted the wet pavement red and blue. Nico sagged against a parked car, breathing hard.",27,133
1q1lv0r,,"“I’m never making fun of your superstitions again,” he said. Casey would have said something sarcastic. The silence where his voice should have been pressed in around us.",28,134
1q1lv0r,,"Mara leaned against the brick wall, her knuckles still white around the flashlight. “Do we…call someone?” she asked. “Cops? News? A priest?”

“And say what?” Nico said.",27,135
1q1lv0r,,"“‘Hey, there’s a Victorian wax skeleton with a candle in its head stuck on Harrow Street because we flipped the breaker’?",21,136
1q1lv0r,,"They’ll arrest us for messing with the grid.”

I stared back down the hill.",14,137
1q1lv0r,,"The old foundry district was just a dark notch in the town, a place where the fog sat heavier.",19,138
1q1lv0r,,"Somewhere in that patch, a small, pale flame moved in hesitant arcs.",12,139
1q1lv0r,,"“If people keep going down there with flashlights,” Mara said, following my gaze, “or leaving candles burning in the windows…he’ll find a path again.",24,140
1q1lv0r,,"He’ll always find a path when there’s light to walk.”

I thought of Jonah’s missing girl. Of Casey lying on the concrete while his shadow burned wrong.",27,141
1q1lv0r,,Of all the kids who came here for kicks with phones and cheap lighters. “What if we don’t let them?” I said. Nico frowned.,24,142
1q1lv0r,,"“Don’t let who what?”

“People,” I said. “What if we make sure nobody goes down there at night with a light.",21,143
1q1lv0r,,"At least on nights like this.”

Mara tilted her head. “You want to put up a sign? ‘Don’t feed the cursed candle creature’?”

“Not a sign,” I said. “A story.",30,144
1q1lv0r,,"We tell them what happened. We tell them what he does. We tell them if they bring light, he follows it.”

“Like an extremely traumatized public service announcement,” Nico said.",30,145
1q1lv0r,,"“Yeah,” I said. “Exactly like that.”

She watched me for a second, then nodded. “Stories stick.",16,146
1q1lv0r,,"People forget facts, but they remember what scares them.”

We walked to Nico’s car in silence.",16,147
1q1lv0r,,"The interior smelled like stale fries and fake pine, and it was the best smell in the world right then.",20,148
1q1lv0r,,"As he drove, the normal sounds of town slowly came back: TVs behind thin walls, a distant dog, the occasional car.",21,149
1q1lv0r,,"It was like the world had snapped back into place, but there was a crack running through it now, and I knew exactly where.",24,150
1q1lv0r,,"“Do we…say his name?” Nico asked at one point. “Whose?” I said, even though I knew. “Elias Harrow. The guy who owned the place.",24,151
1q1lv0r,,"That’s who he was, right?”

I stared out at the passing lights. “We’re not telling anyone his name,” I said. “We tell them the rules. Where not to go.",29,152
1q1lv0r,,"What not to do. That’s it.”

“Names give things power,” Mara said from the back seat. “Stories give people a chance.”

Eventually, Nico turned onto my street.",27,153
1q1lv0r,,"Here, most of the houses were dark. Porch lights off. A few sagging decorations left over from some long-gone holiday drooped in the damp air.",25,154
1q1lv0r,,"He parked in front of my place. “So,” he said, “pizza and movies next weekend?”

“There is no next weekend,” Nico added quickly.",23,155
1q1lv0r,,"“I mean, there is, but we’re not going near anything abandoned ever again.”

Mara managed a small smile. “You’ll forget,” she said. “We all will, a little.",27,156
1q1lv0r,,"That’s why stories matter.”

I stepped out and leaned down to the open window. “Hey,” I said.",17,157
1q1lv0r,,"“If you ever see a single candle burning in a window after midnight…blow it out. Even if it’s not your house.”

“Captain Trauma has spoken,” Nico said, but he nodded.",30,158
1q1lv0r,,"Mara just said, “Goodnight, Evan.”

I watched their taillights fade into the fog, then went inside. My mom had left a lamp on in the living room.",27,159
1q1lv0r,,"A nice, normal lamp, warm and soft. I stood over it for a long second, my hand hovering above the switch.",21,160
1q1lv0r,,"I saw Casey again on the landing, his shadow wrong underneath him, the Candle Man bowing low to examine his flame. I heard that chopped, blown-out scream.",27,161
1q1lv0r,,"I turned the lamp off. The dark that filled the room wasn’t the foundry’s darkness. It felt honest. I stood in it until my eyes adjusted, listening. No screech.",29,162
1q1lv0r,,"No rattling chains. No wet footsteps on the street. Over the next few days, the story spread like they always do.",21,163
1q1lv0r,,"Nico told it once, then had to keep retelling it.",10,164
1q1lv0r,,"He cut out some of the crying and added more running, but he kept the important part: Casey didn’t make it, and it was because they took light where they shouldn’t have.",32,165
1q1lv0r,,"Some kids laughed. Some didn’t. Enough believed that, on the next foggy weekend, Harrow Street stayed darker than usual.",19,166
1q1lv0r,,"A couple of lamps “broke.” People blamed the wiring, the town budget, anything but us. Sometimes, late at night, I’d wake up and listen.",24,167
1q1lv0r,,"Now and then, on a really foggy one, I thought I could hear a faint, distorted wail drifting over the river—glitching in and out like a broken broadcast.",28,168
1q1lv0r,,It never came closer.,4,169
1q1lv0r,,"The Candle Man was still out there somewhere near the foundry, head bowed, candle burning, walking whatever paths of light people gave him—or denied him—with every switch, every screen, every careless flame.",32,170
1q1lv0r,,I don’t know if we made things better or worse.,10,171
1q1lv0r,,"I only know that stories travel faster than he does, and that every time someone listens—every time a porch light goes off a little earlier, every time a candle gets blown out after midnight—somewhere in that dark patch by the river, he pauses at the edge of his own thin circle of light and can’t quite find the next step.",60,172
1q1lv0r,,"And for now, that’s enough for me to sleep.",9,173
1q1hr6n,A New Doctor Just Started Working at my Surgery. I Think He's Harvesting Something.,It was Tuesday after lunch when I noticed the Door.,10,0

1q1hr6n,,The examination couch that usually sat unused against that stretch of wall was gone.,14,2
1q1hr6n,,"In its place was a wooden door, the same as all the consultation rooms, with the number 19 hanging on it in cheery blue numerals.",25,3
1q1hr6n,,"A name card was slotted into the holder: *Dr Skinner.*

I stood, staring for a moment, and promptly dropped my stack of blood bottles all over the floor.",28,4
1q1hr6n,,"""Fuck."" I whispered as I bent to scoop them up. Martha, the sickeningly chipper HCA, appeared from around the corner.",20,5
1q1hr6n,,"""Oooooh, butter fingers!"" She grinned at me as she dropped to stop the scattering vials. ""Thanks, Martha."" I muttered, standing.",20,6
1q1hr6n,,"I forgot about the door as we marched along the corridor, fending off her questions with polite replies.",18,7
1q1hr6n,,"I shook her off finally and closed my door, breathing a sigh of relief. My first patient of the afternoon surgery was one of my regulars, Susan Morris.",28,8
1q1hr6n,,"Susan was your typical worried well, always with a catalogue of vague symptoms requiring broad tests.",16,9
1q1hr6n,,"She chattered away as I scanned the request form, nodding politely but tuning her out. *Coagulation panel*

*Full Blood Count*

*Ferritin*

*Liver Function Tests*

*Prion Exposure Panel*

I paused.",29,10
1q1hr6n,,"*Prion Exposure?* I clicked the panel. *Total tau protein*

I frowned. I'd never come across anything like this.",23,11

""Susan? What did the GP say about the blood tests they wanted you to have?""

""Oh, Dr Skinner was really concerned about my symptoms.",29,13
1q1hr6n,,He said he wanted to rule a few things out.,10,14
1q1hr6n,,"He's ever so good.""

I looked at Susan, confused, and noticed the clock behind her- *Shit, running late already.* I took her blood and chivvied her out of my room.",30,15
1q1hr6n,,"The afternoon wore on as usual. I looked in ears, dressed wounds, vaccinated screaming children. At 16:00 I plodded exhausted into the kitchenette for a cup of tea.",28,16
1q1hr6n,,"Martha was in there, gossiping away to the lead nurse, Becky. I smiled non-comittally as I leaned over to turn the kettle on.",23,17
1q1hr6n,,"""...honestly it just seems like she's not coping, bless her.",10,18
1q1hr6n,,"She completely buggered up the stock order and it was a nightmare sorting out more scalpels for Dr Skinner's clinic!""

I looked up, memory jogged.",25,19
1q1hr6n,,"""Who's Dr Skinner, is he a new trainee or something?""

Martha and Becky looked at me strangely, then exchanged a glance.",21,20
1q1hr6n,,"""Oh Becky, did you manage to get those Shingles vaccines in?"" Asked Martha. My stomach twisted. She always did this. Always had to make me feel small. Out of place.",30,21
1q1hr6n,,I felt my face grow warm as I turned away. I let their chatter fade to a background hum as I stirred my tea.,24,22
1q1hr6n,,"""Anyway, I was reading the notes on CoreRecord and it turns out he was having an affair.""

I looked up. ""Don't you mean CareRecord?""

Martha turned to look at me.",30,23
1q1hr6n,,"""God, what's wrong with you today? You okay?"" She laughed. I smiled weakly, sweat breaking across my back.",18,24
1q1hr6n,,"Back in my room, I hurriedly unlocked my computer and pulled up my afternoon list. There, in mundane grey lettering, was the system name: CoreRecord. My stomach dropped.",28,25
1q1hr6n,,"*But...it had always been CareRecord...*

My thoughts were interrupted by Becky knocking on my door. ""Can you see this next patient for me? Reception's bloody double booked again.""

""Uh, sure.",30,26
1q1hr6n,,"What's the name?""

Michael Jones sat in my chair looking bored. I pulled up his patient record.",18,27
1q1hr6n,,"""What's brought you in today, Michael?""

""I don't know, a receptionist called me and said something about a screening appointment?""

""Do you know what type of screening you need?""

""You're the nurse aren't you?",34,28

1q1hr6n,,"Was this a research thing I didn't know about? Michael looked back at me disdainfully. ""So, why am I here?""

""Looks like it's just routine screening.",26,32

""Oh, yeah.",6,34
1q1hr6n,,"Just dropping off Dr Skinner's screening samples.""

""Oh yes, very good.""

""Do you know if he's doing a research project or something?""

""Oh, I don't think so.",27,35
1q1hr6n,,"Just his special interest. Sorry, got to run, I'm slammed on triage this evening.""

He half ran up the corridor and back into his room.",25,36

1q1hr6n,,"In fact, I remembered 2 trainees having to share a room last year. This door couldn't be here.",18,40

1q1hr6n,,"I pushed the door open. ****

I stepped into the cool, dark room, and the overhead light blinked on. It was a typical GP's office.",25,42
1q1hr6n,,"A wide desk, 2 monitors, a threadbare office chair. But I had never been in this room before. I looked around.",21,43
1q1hr6n,,"A squat, off-white unit sat next to the desk, plugged into the wall. I inspected it closely, realising that it was this that was giving off the low electrical whir.",30,44
1q1hr6n,,"Behind a glass panel, a cylindrical tube was picking up blood bottles and inverting them, once, twice, three times.",19,45
1q1hr6n,,"The bottles were dropped into a slotted tray, and disappeared from view. It wasn't a centrifuge, and it looked too big to be a point of care analyser.",28,46
1q1hr6n,,"Whatever it was, it was processing. I stared, confused. I had never known a GP to process their own samples.",20,47
1q1hr6n,,"Specimens were taken off site for a reason- stored, logged, tracked. I wasn't even sure if this was *legal*, let alone ethical.",22,48
1q1hr6n,,"A shrill, piercing siren made me jump out of my skin. I looked up at the wall unit which flashed the location of the emergency: Room 15.",27,49

I arrived at room 15 to see Martha already tending to an ashen, scared looking patient on the floor.",26,50
1q1hr6n,,"""Hi Natalie, She just fainted having her bloods done.""

""No worries. Hello, I'm Natalie, one of the nurses. Let's get your legs up."" I said.",25,51

""Elaine, Harris."" She said weakly as Martha bustled from the room.",26,52
1q1hr6n,,"""Well Elaine, don't worry, we'll get you sorted. Not a fan of having your blood taken?""

""No, it's not that. I'm usually fine, I give blood.",26,53
1q1hr6n,,"I just feel awful all of a sudden.""

I looked at her pale, clammy face. Something was wrong. I pressed my fingers to her wrist, feeling her rapid, thready pulse.",30,54
1q1hr6n,,"I felt her body stiffen under my hands. Her eyes rolled back, and she began convulsing. ""I NEED SOME HELP!"" I shouted down the corridor.",25,55
1q1hr6n,,"I rushed back to Elaine, turning her onto her side. Martha appeared. ""Martha, get me the oxygen and tell reception to ring for an ambulance, do it now.""

Martha disappeared.",30,56
1q1hr6n,,"I supported Elaine gently and the seizure continued. ""Come on Elaine, you'll be okay. Stay with me now.""

A gush of thick, black liquid spilled from her mouth.",28,57
1q1hr6n,,"I recoiled, horrified. ""No...No, no.""

I knew instantly what it was. Upper GI bleed, massive. Catastrophic. Elaine's body slumped over. The seizure stopped abruptly. I rolled her back towards me.",30,58
1q1hr6n,,"I felt her pulse; nothing. I screamed for help again and began pumping her chest, tears rolling down my face.",20,59
1q1hr6n,,"****

I watched numbly as the paramedics, Becky and Martha attached the defibrillator and the bag valve mask, and continued the fruitless effort to resuscitate.",25,60
1q1hr6n,,"""Still no pulse, she's been down for an hour now.""

""Stop compressions."" The lead paramedic said. ""Time of death, 18:15.""

Elaine's blood was still under my fingernails.",28,61

""Yeah, fine."" I lied.",23,62
1q1hr6n,,"I accepted the hot drink, grateful for the warmth. Becky's concern evaporated, and she nodded briskly.",16,63
1q1hr6n,,"""Well, I'm staying late too, I need to speak to the partners - and Elaine's family.",16,64
1q1hr6n,,"I'll be in my office if you need me.""

I understood that further discussion was not welcome. She left, and I opened Elaine's record.",24,65

*-18- 45*

*- BMI within normal ranges*

*- No history of autoimmune or inflammatory disease*

*- No medical or familial history of any neurodegenerative disease, including dementias or prion diseases*

*Initial screening involves baseline bloods and observations.",59,88

Dr Clark was senior partner.",24,92

""I've already moved things around."" She said, smiling wider.",16,113

""What training?""

She just looked at me, the irritation visible on her face. ""Well.",29,120

My eyes fixed on the familiar sheet of paper, jaw set, heart pounding. ""You'll be in the minor ops room.",25,126

She nodded with finality and left the room. I sat for a moment, unreality washing over me.",30,131

Dr Skinner had been busy. The room was almost unrecognisable; It felt less like a minor ops suite and more like a complete theatre.",25,132
1q1hr6n,,"I took in the various objects lining the walls. A familiar electrical hum sounded from the corner, and I recognised the sample processor from the doctor's office- already switched on.",30,133

Helen Smith sat nervously on the edge of the examination couch as I wrapped the blood pressure cuff around her arm.",22,137

1q1hr6n,,"""I see you've already consented to the procedure. Remove your shirt and lie back.""

Helen did as she was instructed.",20,142
1q1hr6n,,"I turned my body slightly away, trying not to look as Dr Skinner's long, pale fingers probed Helen's flesh.",19,143
1q1hr6n,,"He traced the midline of her abdomen, gently palpated the right ribs, and applied pressure to the right upper quadrant.",20,144
1q1hr6n,,"""Tru-cut needle, please nurse."" 

I hesitated, eyeing the ultrasound probe that sat unplugged in the corner. Surely he's not going in blind...",22,145
1q1hr6n,,"""Nurse Porter,"" the cold voice snapped, and I obeyed, gloved hand shaking slightly. In the back of my mind, a thought barely registered. He hasn't asked for anaesthetic.",28,146
1q1hr6n,,"""You will feel a pinch. Stay perfectly still.""

My jaw clenched as I heard the sudden click and spring of the biopsy needle. ""Oh! That felt strange.",27,147
1q1hr6n,,"Is it supposed to feel like that?""

Dr Skinner ignored her. ""Sample pot.""

I handed it over and watched as he dropped the liver tissue into the clear liquid.",29,148
1q1hr6n,,"He adjusted his grip, repositioned the needle. Click-spring. Helen gasped as the doctor withdrew. I watched her fingers curl into the paper sheet. ""Pot.""

I complied.",26,149
1q1hr6n,,"""Now, that wasn't so bad, was it? Nurse Porter will help you with a dressing."" 

He walked over to the processor, and carefully placed the pots inside.",27,150
1q1hr6n,,"The incision was bleeding more than it should. Helen was pale, frightened. I muttered some soothing nonsense as I applied pressure to the wound.",24,151
1q1hr6n,,"I looked at the monitor: BP 90/60. ""Dr Skinner?""

He turned to look at the screen. He quietly put two fingers to Helen's wrist. ""Hmm.",25,152
1q1hr6n,,"That will be sufficient."" He peeled off his gloves and stepped back. ""Nurse, apply the pressure dressing and help Mrs Smith out.",22,153
1q1hr6n,,"She will not tolerate further intervention.""

Ben Graham was alone in the waiting room when I called him.",19,154
1q1hr6n,,"He smiled at me as we walked and a pang of guilt rang through me, though I couldn't say why.",20,155
1q1hr6n,,"Helen Smith's blood had been cleaned off the couch, fresh paper marking the place where she had lain. Ben sat, looking embarrassed, like he was wasting the doctor's time.",29,156
1q1hr6n,,"""Mr Graham. Your preliminary results were most reassuring. Today we will proceed with neurological screening.",15,157
1q1hr6n,,"All being well, you should be an excellent candidate for intervention."" Said Dr Skinner, opening his hands and smiling at Ben. Ben nodded, eager to please.",26,158
1q1hr6n,,"The doctor pulled a latex glove over his long fingers. He ran his hand delicately over the instruments, touch lingering on the bone saw, just for a second.",28,159
1q1hr6n,,"He raised his eyes. ""Nurse, shave and swab the scalp as indicated."" 

I looked at the small circle on Ben's temple, marked in black ink.",25,160
1q1hr6n,,"I didn't say no, not once. ""Now, Mr Graham, be sure to hold very still."" The doctor said, pausing just long enough for Ben to nod again.",27,161
1q1hr6n,,"""Hand burr please, nurse."" 

There was a soft, gritty sound, like folded sandpaper. I stared hard at the monitor, feeling my bile rise. Ben's pulse spiked, then slowed.",28,162
1q1hr6n,,"""Pot."" 

I held out the container, and heard the plop as a sliver of Ben's brain dropped into it.",19,163
1q1hr6n,,Dr Skinner slid off his gloves and collected the pot from my hands.,13,164
1q1hr6n,,"He walked over to the processor, pressed a button, and delicately placed the container on the receiving tray. I looked over at Ben. His eyes were glazed, uncomprehending.",28,165
1q1hr6n,,Blood and clear fluid were seeping from the hole in his head.,12,166
1q1hr6n,,"Suddenly aware I hadn't moved since he said my name, I forced myself to turn back to Dr Skinner. The machine whirred and clicked. A light flashed red.",28,167
1q1hr6n,,My mind flashed back to the blood panels. *Total tau protein...,11,168
1q1hr6n,,"dementias...*

""Hmmm.""

""What does it mean?""

""It means, nurse Porter, that Mr Graham is not eligible.""

Michael Jones was already in the room when I returned from the sluice.",30,169
1q1hr6n,,"He stood awkwardly, jacket held tight over one arm, reading a poster on the wall. He looked up as I entered, smiling nervously. ""Am I in the right place?",29,170
1q1hr6n,,"The receptionist said it was this room.""

I wanted to scream at him, to beg him to run. But I didn't.",21,171
1q1hr6n,,"""Yes,"" I said, voice steady despite the pounding in my ears. ""Dr Skinner will be with you shortly."" I smiled, gesturing at the couch.",24,172
1q1hr6n,,"""Please, have a seat."" 

The temperature in the room dropped. I looked back to see Dr Skinner close the door and click the lock, shutting us in.",27,173
1q1hr6n,,"""Mr Jones."" He smiled, pleased. ""Thank you for coming in. You'll be happy to know that your results were exceptional.""

I wrapped the cuff around Michael's arm, avoiding his eyes.",30,174
1q1hr6n,,"“Exceptional?” Michael laughed softly. “That’s a first.”

“Indeed,” said Dr Skinner. “Most people your age don’t appreciate the importance of preservation. You’d be surprised how quickly things... decline.”

Michael nodded.",30,175
1q1hr6n,,"“Yeah, I try to keep fit. Gym a couple of times a week. Nothing mad.”

“Pulse?” Dr Skinner asked. “72.” I said. “Excellent. Yes, Mr Jones.",26,176
1q1hr6n,,"I was especially pleased to see that your neurological profile is... intact. That's becoming vanishingly rare, these days."" 

He stepped closer. “So, what happens now?” Michael asked nervously.",28,177
1q1hr6n,,"“Is it another blood test?”

""No. Please, take off your shirt."" Dr Skinner said, barely audible. Michael obeyed. He frowned. ""I feel... heavy.""

""Perfectly normal."" The doctor purred.",28,178
1q1hr6n,,"""Sorry, I skipped lunch. Probably didn't help.""

""On the contrary. Fasting improves quality.""

""Quality of what?""

Dr Skinner placed a hand on Michael's shoulder.",24,179
1q1hr6n,,"""Of the meat."" 

I watched, paralysed, as the doctor's face shifted to reveal what lay beneath. The balding scalp rippled as the skin stretched.",24,180
1q1hr6n,,"The features swam across the false face, rearranging themselves to make room. I stared in silence as the jaw unhinged.",20,181
1q1hr6n,,"Rows of jagged teeth slid into place in the wet, pink gums. The mandible popped horribly as it dislocated.",19,182
1q1hr6n,,"The thick red tongue lolled in the thing's mouth as it reared back, then lunged forward, clamping its jaws on Michael's thigh.",22,183
1q1hr6n,,"The stink of metal hit me as teeth ripped into flesh, tearing the femoral artery open. Claret sprayed, coating Michael's torso and face. ""I can't feel my leg...",28,184
1q1hr6n,,"is that normal?"" He asked anxiously. ""Perfectly normal."" The thing gurgled, grinning with pleasure. Michael leaned back, grimacing in discomfort as he looked at the ceiling.",26,185
1q1hr6n,,"""I hate coming to the doctors'. Always makes me feel a bit queasy.",13,186
1q1hr6n,,"You must think I'm such a wimp.""

The creature growled in ecstasy, crushing Michael's pelvis between its jaws. I heard the bones snap like twigs.",25,187
1q1hr6n,,"""Do you know if I'll be okay to drive after this, nurse?"" He turned to look at me. I couldn't move.",21,188
1q1hr6n,,"""I'll have to get my wife to pick me up..."" his voice trailed off as the doctor opened his abdomen.",20,189
1q1hr6n,,"As it bit into the aorta, I watched the light trickle out of Michael's eyes. His expression was set, just a man enduring a mildly uncomfortable medical procedure.",28,190
1q1hr6n,,"The thing fed. When it was done, it looked at me. The mask snapped back into place, and Dr Skinner smiled at me warmly. ""Now, nurse Porter.",27,191

“Yeah, in like a year.”

“Three-hundred-and-sixty-four days and fourteen hours, actually,” I responded, knowing the joke would change the mood.",62,13

1q1hbes,,"Arriving at Olivias place, I noticed that small decorations and custom street signs had been removed, leaving the street just slightly empty.",22,54
1q1hbes,,"It was an odd contrast to the welcoming sight I had witnessed a thousand times before, but other than slightly putting me on edge, there didn’t seem to be more to it.",32,55
1q1hbes,,"I knocked on Olivia’s front door. She opened but didn’t seem too amused by my presence. “Hey,” I said, a half-assed greeting.",22,56
1q1hbes,,"“Hey, Marcus,” she said with little enthusiasm in her voice, “what do you want.”

“I just wanted to properly apologize for what happened on New Year’s Eve.”

She avoided eye contact, giving a brief response.",35,57
1q1hbes,,“It’s fine. I just overreacted a bit.,7,58
1q1hbes,,"That’s all.”

“Still, I should have been there.”

“It’s not a big deal, really,” she insisted

“You sure, I just feel like—” I began before Olivia cut me off.",29,59
1q1hbes,,"“Marcus, we’ve been friends for a long time. Let’s just leave it at that and keep going as normal.”

Her words stung, even though they shouldn’t have.",27,60
1q1hbes,,"We had been friends for years, but a part of me had wanted more, and I thought she did too.",20,61
1q1hbes,,I thought that New Year’s Eve of 2025 might change the dynamic of our relationship.,15,62
1q1hbes,,"It was partially the reason why I’d had more to drink, to gather courage to kiss her as the clock struck midnight, but I’d taken it too far.",28,63
1q1hbes,,"“Yeah…” I responded, too much of a coward to clarify. “Look, I have a lot to do today.",18,64
1q1hbes,,"I don’t really have time for—”

“It’s fine,” I said, and we both left it at that. Disappointed, I drove back home, again put off by the empty neighborhood.",29,65

1q1hbes,,"Even though the Christmas decorations had long since vanished as was appropriate, their year-around decorations had also been taken down.",20,67
1q1hbes,,But the oddity of the missing decorations stung little compared to Olivia’s half rejection.,14,68

1q1hbes,,"He just jotted it down to the cleaning crew having accidentally removed the wrong decorations, and claimed he’d take care of it.",22,76
1q1hbes,,But despite his promises the inexplicably missing decorations would fail to reappear in the coming weeks.,16,77

1q1hbes,,"On Wednesday the Fifteenth of January, the house next to my apartment block vanished.",14,80
1q1hbes,,It was an ancient construction serving as the home of an elderly lady who had spent her entire life within the same house.,23,81

1q1hbes,,"As a panicked last resort, I tried to alert my neighbors, but the ones who even bothered to open the door seemed to jot it down to construction work, as if they had erased a piece of history overnight.",39,87
1q1hbes,,"Frustrated, but unable to do anything to change the situation, I accepted the empty lot as a new part of our neighborhood.",22,88
1q1hbes,,"The elderly lady who’d lived there never returned, so I couldn’t ask the house’s only resident what had actually happened.",20,89
1q1hbes,,"It was odd, but I didn’t have enough information to start asking the right questions. And so, the week would continue, small buildings and shops would vanish from their streets.",30,90
1q1hbes,,"Few would think to question the occurrences, and since the inhabitants of the buildings weren’t there to explain themselves, there was little information for anyone to work with.",28,91

1q1hbes,,"We’d only kept in contact via messages since the beginning of the year, but as tensions around the country rose, she had called to ask how I was holding up.",30,99
1q1hbes,,"I had decided to give her some space until things between us calmed down, which was the reason why I hadn’t contacted her first.",24,100
1q1hbes,,"Still, I was ecstatic to hear her voice. “I heard about your college,” she said. “Yeah, it’s fucking insane, isn’t it?”

“What do you think is going on?” she asked.",30,101
1q1hbes,,"“I wish I knew.”

“Do you think people are being kidnapped for, like, government experiments?”

“Wouldn’t explain the disappearing buildings and stuff,” I explained.",24,102
1q1hbes,,"Though she was interested in the mystery, that wasn’t the reason she had called. “What are you going to do now?” she asked.",23,103
1q1hbes,,"“Stay here, work, wait for things to turn back to normal,” I responded, “what about you?”

She hesitated before responding, “I’m going back to Minnesota to stay with my parents until things blow over.”

“You’re leaving?” I asked, shocked by the announcement.",42,104
1q1hbes,,"“Things might get worse before they get better. My parents worry,” she said. “But, what about—” I began. “College isn’t going to continue for a while.",26,105
1q1hbes,,"There’s nothing keeping me here.”

I wanted to argue but elected not to disagree. “So, yeah. That’s what I’m doing.”

“I understand,” I finally responded.",25,106
1q1hbes,,"An uncomfortable long silence hung in the air, neither of us speaking for what felt like an eternity.",18,107
1q1hbes,,"I wanted to tell her how scared I was, that I didn’t understand why the world was falling apart, but I held my tongue, worried to open up.",28,108

“Couldn’t they be?” I asked.",20,109

1q1hbes,,"Can we talk when things calm down?”

“Of course.”

“Take care of yourself.”

She ended the conversation there before things got too emotional, but it felt good to hear her voice one final time, especially in with the context of what was to come.",44,111

1q1g637,Anesthesia isn't what you think.,The main ingredient in general anesthesia is propofol.,8,0
1q1g637,,"And while I’m a chemist by trade, I’d never given much thought to propofol in my life—until I was scheduled for a surgery.",23,1
1q1g637,,A routine procedure to repair a hernia that had been bothering me for some time.,15,2
1q1g637,,"Like most people facing surgery for the first time, I read up on the anesthesia process. I wanted to know what would happen when I was put under.",28,3
1q1g637,,"What I found, at first, was reassuring enough. But the properties of propofol struck me as… strange. We all assume that during surgery we don’t feel anything because we’re unconscious.",30,4
1q1g637,,And that’s fine. I had no desire to be awake on an operating table. But propofol doesn’t just make you sleep.,21,5
1q1g637,,"It has another effect—one that made me a little uncomfortable. Besides inducing unconsciousness, propofol is also an amnesiac. That is, it makes you forget.",24,6
1q1g637,,"More precisely, it prevents the brain from encoding memory in the first place. I’m sure I wasn’t alone in considering the implications of that once I learned it.",28,7
1q1g637,,The question lodged itself in my mind and refused to leave. What if anesthesia isn’t what we think it is?,20,8
1q1g637,,"What if, far from eliminating pain during surgery, it’s simply a way to ensure you don’t remember how painful it was?",21,9
1q1g637,,"I couldn’t stop picturing myself strapped to the operating table—conscious, aware, feeling everything—while my brain quietly failed to record it. An experience perfectly lived and perfectly erased.",27,10
1q1g637,,"Needless to say, the thought disturbed me. The more I turned it over, the more it consumed me. Part of it was fear, but part of it was professional curiosity.",30,11
1q1g637,,"As a scientist, I wanted an answer. A real one. And there was no way to get it without putting myself at risk. But I was willing to test it.",30,12
1q1g637,,"You see, it wouldn’t be particularly difficult to design a compound that interfered specifically with propofol’s effect on memory encoding while leaving its other mechanisms untouched.",26,13
1q1g637,,"In principle, I could create a drug that—if taken beforehand—would allow me to remember everything. If anesthesia worked the way we believed it did, the compound would do nothing.",29,14
1q1g637,,"I’d be unconscious, and there would be nothing to remember. But if something else was happening—if consciousness remained—I would know.",20,15
1q1g637,,"I told myself that, as surgeries go, a hernia repair probably wasn’t that bad. Painful, yes, but survivable. And if I did remember something—anything—it would be traumatic, certainly.",28,16
1q1g637,,But it would also be a scientific discovery of enormous importance. I decided I would take the chance.,18,17
1q1g637,,"With more than a month before my surgery, I got to work mapping out propofol’s pathways and its effects on memory.",21,18
1q1g637,,"I learned that its primary impact comes from potentiating GABA\_A receptors, increasing chloride influx into neurons and hyperpolarizing post-synaptic membranes.",20,19
1q1g637,,"In simple terms, it shuts down the conditions required for memory formation.",12,20
1q1g637,,My goal was to create a compound that bound to those same receptors but had a dramatically shorter half-life.,19,21
1q1g637,,"Long enough to block propofol’s amnesiac effect, but brief enough to clear quickly and allow memory function to resume. The timing would be critical.",24,22
1q1g637,,I would need to take it shortly before the propofol was administered. That wasn’t a problem.,16,23
1q1g637,,"I tested the compound on myself, measuring recall and tracking the timing of memory gaps after ingestion.",17,24
1q1g637,,"After a week or two of refinement, I had something I believed would work. The preliminary results were promising. And that, I told myself, was the most dangerous part.",29,25
1q1g637,,"In all likelihood, I was in more danger ingesting my haphazard compounds than I would be from the anesthesia, regardless of how it ended up working.",26,26
1q1g637,,But I had passed that hurdle and was (anxiously) ready for my surgery.,13,27
1q1g637,,"When the day finally came, I tucked the small glass vial containing my compound into my pocket and headed over to the surgery center.",24,28
1q1g637,,"Just before they wheeled me off to the operating room, I downed the liquid… there was no turning back now.",20,29
1q1g637,,The doctor hooked up my IV and told me to count down from ten. I don't think I got to five.,21,30

1q1g637,,"My wrists and ankles were strapped down. I struggled against my restraints, but couldn't budge. Soon though, a man entered the room. He didn't look like a doctor.",28,32

1q1g637,,"""I'm a technician for \[I'm censoring the name of the company for my safety, but it's a big tech company that you *would recognize*\] and we have purchased the biometric data rights from this surgery center.""

I didn't know what that meant and was more than a little freaked out.",50,34
1q1g637,,"So, I returned to struggling feebly against my restraints. ""Mr. Jones, please. Your surgery was a success.",17,35

I didn't know what that was when he said it, but soon discovered, to my horror, that it's the fluid in your eye.",31,42
1q1g637,,"A small door on the device hissed open, and the long needle approached my eye with a metallic glint. I screamed. I struggled.",23,43
1q1g637,,"But ultimately, I stared helplessly as the needle pierced my eye. The pain was excruciating. Another beep, and the needle retracted.",21,44
1q1g637,,"""On to gastrointestinal data."" The man spoke so casually, as if he had done this hundreds of times. He probably had.",21,45
1q1g637,,"A long cylindrical apparatus emerged from the device, and without warning rammed itself into my mouth. I could feel the cold metal snaking down my throat, muffling my screams.",29,46
1q1g637,,"It felt like that thing was inside me for an eternity. And when it emerged, it was covered in clear, viscous goop.",22,47
1q1g637,,"""We got your blood while we were in there. Time for bone marrow.""

The device hovered over my right leg, just out of my range of sight.",27,48
1q1g637,,"I heard the unmistakable sound of a drill whiz to life and felt a shooting pain in my thigh. ""Alright. Almost done,"" the man said.",25,49

1q1fnea,,"Of course, I chose the door where Mom lived. Everything remained frozen except for one of my hands, which alone could move to make the choice.",26,9
1q1fnea,,"The instant I did, I found myself waking up beside Mom, as if I had been dreaming. She stirred moments later, smiling as she stroked my hair.",27,10
1q1fnea,,"She looked healthy, alive, and completely unaware of what had almost happened. But something was wrong. Her eye color had changed. They were slightly grey, dull.",26,11
1q1fnea,,"From that moment onwards, it began. At school, whenever bullies harassed me, timelines would appear, and the doors would show up.",21,12
1q1fnea,,"I would choose the one where I was saved, where the situation dissolved before it could hurt me. The next day, those same bullies would act friendly, too friendly.",29,13
1q1fnea,,"Their eyes would be light grey, and their grins wider than ever. At the same time, I began to feel something deeply unsettling.",23,14
1q1fnea,,"I would find myself present somewhere else while frozen in the real world. The first time I helped Mom, I had been frozen only until I chose the door.",29,15
1q1fnea,,"But from the second time onwards, things changed drastically. I would remain frozen for minutes, my body locked in place.",20,16
1q1fnea,,"3 Years later while driving a car, I had almost gotten off the cliff. But then the timelines appeared, and then the doors.",23,17
1q1fnea,,"Choosing the one in which I survived left me frozen for an hour or more. While driving off, I saw an oncoming truck, the driver had grey eyes.",28,18
1q1fnea,,"During those times, I was never present as myself in the real world. I was somewhere else entirely.",18,19
1q1fnea,,"I remembered things I had never lived, experienced events that had never happened to me, and did things that weren’t humanly possible. But greed had caged me.",27,20
1q1fnea,,"The timelines became a habit. The world became my playground. Whenever I felt anxious or afraid, the timelines appeared to rescue me.",22,21
1q1fnea,,I stopped asking why they came and stopped caring what they took in return. This went on for fifteen years.,20,22
1q1fnea,,"I was given countless opportunities and lived countless lives in parallel, slipping between versions of myself without hesitation. Then, abruptly, it stopped.",22,23
1q1fnea,,"And the ones who had been touched by the timelines began to change, becoming something they had never been before.",20,24
1q1esd5,My One and Only Demonic Experience,"Although I can’t remember the exact year, I was most likely 16 years old. I‘d been living in Ireland for just under three years, having moved from England.",28,0
1q1esd5,,My family and I lived in the midlands in a very small town.,13,1
1q1esd5,,"During my teenage years, because of how depressing my life was, mostly due to hating school, I regularly began believing and praying to God – naively thinking if I did, he would magically make my life better.",37,2
1q1esd5,,"Well, it was during this “spiritual faze” that I came upon a certain online video.",15,3
1q1esd5,,"The video was about a man who had apparently been brought by Jesus to hell, and while he was there, Jesus showed him all kinds of eternal horrors.",28,4
1q1esd5,,"From what I can remember, the man saw the souls of people being tortured and burned alive by demons or something.",21,5
1q1esd5,,"Well, after experiencing this, the man then wakes up in his bed, as though from a dream – however, the man claimed what he experienced wasn’t a dream at all, but a real experience of what happens to sinners in hell.",41,6
1q1esd5,,"Although I didn’t know if what this man experienced was real or not, it definitely made me terrified of ever spending eternity in the fiery depths of hell.",28,7
1q1esd5,,"However, not long after watching this video, I suddenly felt very unsettled.",12,8
1q1esd5,,"Not because of the video I just watched, but to my memory, I almost felt as though I was now being watched while supposedly alone in my bedroom.",28,9
1q1esd5,,"But not only did I feel like I was being watched, I also felt like I was somehow in danger – so much so that I leave my room to go downstairs, as that’s where my parents and sister were.",40,10
1q1esd5,,"Now, what comes next is the real scary part of this experience – because as soon as I reach down the stairs, before I could enter any room, I feel a hard physical tap on the back of my shoulder, where I then literally turn around and scream.",48,11
1q1esd5,,"No word of a lie, I screamed. But when I turn around, there isn’t anyone or anything there, as though a ghost had tapped me on the back.",28,12
1q1esd5,,"Also worth mentioning, is that I had screamed so loud that my mum was now shouting me from the living room, asking what was wrong.",25,13
1q1esd5,,"For the rest of that evening, I remember being very afraid and skittish, that every noise or movement I heard had me incredibly paranoid.",24,14
1q1esd5,,"In fact, I was so skittish, that whenever my dog, who was still just a small puppy at the time, came up to me, I was afraid of her touching me.",31,15
1q1esd5,,"Living in this house for only a few more months before moving, I never had another experience like this one - nor have I since.",25,16
1q1esd5,,"Although I’ve always been a fan of horror, I basically know little to nothing about demons or ghosts – as I find Aliens and cryptids a lot more interesting.",29,17

1q1dqq4,,"But three days ago, I learned that nature doesn't always play by the rules we’ve written for it.",18,2
1q1dqq4,,I had decided to take a solo trip to a remote valley to photograph the autumn leaves.,17,3
1q1dqq4,,I parked my car at the end of a gravel road and set off on a well-marked trail.,18,4
1q1dqq4,,"My plan was simple: hike four miles in, set up camp near a stream, and head back the next morning.",20,5
1q1dqq4,,The trouble started when I reached the clearing where the stream was supposed to be. The water was gone.,19,6
1q1dqq4,,"Not just dried up, but replaced by a deep, perfectly circular trench filled with white, chalky dust. I checked my map, but the landmarks didn't match.",26,7
1q1dqq4,,"The mountain to my left was too high, and the trees were no longer oaks—they were tall, grey trunks with needle-like leaves that whistled in the wind.",27,8
1q1dqq4,,"I decided to turn back, but the trail I had just walked had vanished.",14,9
1q1dqq4,,In its place was a wall of thorns so thick that even a lumberjack would have struggled to clear it. I wasn't just lost.,24,10
1q1dqq4,,"I was in a place that didn't want to let me go. As the sun began to set, the temperature dropped rapidly.",22,11
1q1dqq4,,I found a small cave at the base of a cliff and decided to hole up for the night.,19,12
1q1dqq4,,"I started a small fire using some dry brush, but the smoke didn't rise.",14,13
1q1dqq4,,"It settled on the ground like a heavy, grey liquid, flowing out of the cave and toward the forest. Then I heard the voices.",24,14
1q1dqq4,,"It sounded like a crowd of people talking at a party. I heard a woman laughing, a child shouting about a game, and a man discussing the weather.",28,15
1q1dqq4,,"It was the sound of a busy city square, but I was in the middle of a desolate wilderness. ""Is anyone there?"" I shouted, grabbing my hunting knife.",28,16
1q1dqq4,,The voices stopped instantly. The silence that followed was so absolute it made my ears ring.,16,17
1q1dqq4,,"Then, a single voice answered from the darkness just outside the light of my fire. It was my mother’s voice. ""You’re late for dinner,"" the voice said.",27,18
1q1dqq4,,"It was her exact tone, her exact inflection. But my mother had passed away in a hospital three years ago.",20,19
1q1dqq4,,"""Who are you?"" I screamed, my knuckles turning white around the handle of the knife. A figure stepped into the flickering light. It wasn't a person.",26,20
1q1dqq4,,"It was a collection of sticks, rotted leaves, and grey mud, molded into the shape of a woman. It didn't have a face—just a flat surface of wet clay.",29,21
1q1dqq4,,"But when it spoke, the sound came from deep inside its chest. ""I’m the one who remembers your name,"" the thing said. ""The others have forgotten.",26,22
1q1dqq4,,"The ranger, the search party, even your brother. They think you fell into the ravine. They’ve already stopped looking.""

I didn't wait to hear more.",25,23
1q1dqq4,,I grabbed my backpack and sprinted into the dark forest. I didn't care about the thorns or the lack of a path.,22,24
1q1dqq4,,I ran until my lungs felt like they were filled with broken glass. I eventually stumbled onto a dirt track that looked familiar.,23,25
1q1dqq4,,"I followed it for miles until I saw the headlights of a truck parked near a bridge. I ran toward it, waving my arms and crying for help.",28,26
1q1dqq4,,"The driver stepped out. He was an older man in a flannel shirt. He looked at me with a mixture of pity and confusion. ""You okay, son?"" he asked.",29,27
1q1dqq4,,"""You look like you've seen a ghost.""

""I got lost,"" I sobbed. ""In the forest near the valley.",18,28
1q1dqq4,,"I’ve been out there for three days.""

The man frowned and checked his watch. ""Son, that valley was cleared for a housing development ten years ago.",26,29
1q1dqq4,,"There hasn't been a forest there since I was a boy.""

I looked back at the way I had come. The trees were gone.",24,30
1q1dqq4,,"In their place was a vast, empty construction site filled with concrete foundations and piles of gravel. I reached into my pocket and felt something cold. I pulled it out.",30,31
1q1dqq4,,"It was a small, hand-carved wooden heart. On the back, written in the chalky white dust I had seen in the trench, was my name.",25,32
1q1dqq4,,"I’m home now, in my apartment, but I don't feel safe. Every time I close my eyes, I hear the whistling of those needle-like leaves.",25,33

1q1bna4,,"Strange, I thought to myself, but my mind felt too exhausted by the ride to give it much thought.",19,6
1q1bna4,,I retired to my quarters and slept until the knocks of the owner woke me up. He informed me that the meal would be served soon.,26,7
1q1bna4,,"The lunchroom area was empty, save for an older man eating alone in the back. I introduced myself to him and asked if I could share the table with him.",30,8
1q1bna4,,"He happily offered me a seat. We quickly got to talking; he was a charming and funny man, telling me stories about the town and his time growing up here.",30,9
1q1bna4,,"He asked about the purpose of my visit. When I informed him that I would be interviewing Lord E. Ashford later this evening, he almost choked on his food. “Mr.",30,10
1q1bna4,,"Herring, I’ve seen what they’ve done to this town before.”

“Every year in late autumn, people lock up their houses and put bars on their doors.",26,11

What he said startled me; his words and emotions seemed genuine. “Please, Mr.",25,15
1q1bna4,,"Conor, I’m sure I’ll be okay. I appreciate your concerns, but I’m sure Lord Ashford wouldn’t try to hurt a renowned academic.”

Mr.",23,16
1q1bna4,,Conor looked me in the eyes with worry. He let out a slow sigh. “Mr.,15,17

He took off a necklace that had a beautiful, bright stone and handed it to me.",29,18
1q1bna4,,"“Thank you, Mr. Conor, I greatly appreciate it.”

I put the necklace in my pocket. “No, Mr. Herring!” Mr. Conor almost screamed out. “Sorry, I apologize.",26,19

He walked around and put the necklace around my neck and stuffed it under my shirt.",27,20

Mr.",19,21

1q1bna4,,I was about to take it off when the tavern owner informed me that Lord Ashford’s car was waiting outside.,20,24
1q1bna4,,He had the same look of worry as he had before. I quickly rushed into my room to get my notes and walked outside.,24,25

1q1bna4,,"To collect my family’s history and the local legends about it, if I’m not mistaken.”

“Yes, Lord Ashford, that’s correct.”

“Well, let me start by explaining how the legends were born.”

“In the early 1700s, there had been two years of mass disappearances, or so the records claim.",48,36
1q1bna4,,"People in the town were getting desperate, looking for answers. The town's preacher, Mr.",14,37

“After one of the blacksmith’s daughters disappeared too, the people grew restless and walked up to our old mansion to set it ablaze.",31,38

“It was only my grandfather who decided to return.” He pointed to a painting on a wall; the man bore a near-perfect resemblance to Lord E.",32,39

“Yes, they have Lord Ashford.”

“Of course they have. Well, Mr.",24,41
1q1bna4,,"Herring, this was but a small introduction to our family affairs.",11,42
1q1bna4,,"What do you say to some Cognac before we really dive in?”

Lord Ashford didn’t wait for my answer and got up from his chair.",25,43
1q1bna4,,"As he walked to the alcohol shelf, his body began moving in strange ways. A smell of copper was in the air. “Lord Ashford, are you okay?”

“Mr.",28,44

1q1bna4,,"My ears rang while a wave of hot air flew around me. The skin on his head turned gray, and his clothing ripped to reveal a muscular gray body.",29,46

1q1ao8q,,"You're not workers, you're users. And the product? Your fucking compliance.""

Plato stood up, still holding the cube.",18,32
1q1ao8q,,"The morning light hit it at an angle and for just a second it seemed to glow from within, that iridescent blue pulsing like a heartbeat. The forest went silent.",30,33
1q1ao8q,,"Not gradually. Instantly. Every bird, every insect, every rustle of wind through leaves.",13,34
1q1ao8q,,"The air went thick and heavy, pressing against my eardrums like I'd descended too fast in an airplane. My breath fogged despite the warm morning.",25,35
1q1ao8q,,"""Put it away,"" Jim whispered, backing toward the door.",9,36
1q1ao8q,,"""Put it the fuck away right now.""

But Plato was staring past him, into the tree line, and that wrong smile was spreading across his face.",26,37
1q1ao8q,,"""Do you see them?"" he asked, voice full of wonder and horror in equal measure. I looked. At first I thought they were trees. Then I thought they were shadows.",30,38
1q1ao8q,,Then my eyes adjusted and I realized they were men. Or had been.,13,39
1q1ao8q,,"Dozens of them, standing at the edge of the clearing in perfect silence, watching us with empty eye sockets.",19,40
1q1ao8q,,"Their skin was gray, covered in fine black dust like coal miners who'd never washed. Some wore clothes from decades ago. Overalls and work shirts rotted to threads.",28,41
1q1ao8q,,"Others were older, dressed in styles I didn't recognize. They didn't move. Didn't breathe. Just stood there, watching the cube with that terrible hungry attention. ""Soot-men,"" Jim breathed. ""Oh fuck.",30,42
1q1ao8q,,"Oh Jesus fuck, they're manifesting in daylight.""

Every part of me wanted to bolt.",14,43
1q1ao8q,,"Legs screaming run, brain trying to check out, bladder about to make me piss myself like a little kid.",19,44
1q1ao8q,,This wasn't movie horror or some fucked-up website.This was wrong on a level that bypassed thought and went straight to the primitive part of your brain that knows when you're prey.,31,45
1q1ao8q,,"Plato stepped forward. Toward them. ""Plato, don't—""

""They're drawn to it, man,"" he said, but the 'man' sounded like he was trying to remember how people talked.",27,46
1q1ao8q,,"""Like moths to a really fucked-up flame.""

One of the figures took a step forward. Its foot made no sound on the forest floor. Plato let out a laugh.",29,47
1q1ao8q,,"A short, sharp sound like a lock clicking open. Nothing human about it. Jim bolted.",15,48
1q1ao8q,,"Just turned and ran, crashing through the underbrush with the desperate speed of a man who'd seen this before and knew how it ended. I wanted to follow.",28,49
1q1ao8q,,"Every instinct screamed at me to follow. But Plato was still walking toward them, cube extended like an offering, and I couldn't leave him alone with those things. ""Plato. Please.",30,50
1q1ao8q,,"We need to go.""

He stopped, swaying slightly, then slowly turned back to me. The smile faded.",17,51
1q1ao8q,,"For just a second I saw my friend again, confused, scared, realizing he'd walked too close to something terrible. ""Yeah,"" he said shakily. ""Yeah, okay. Let's...",26,52
1q1ao8q,,"let's go.""

The figures didn't follow us back to camp. They just stood there, watching, until we lost sight of them through the trees.",24,53
1q1ao8q,,Felt their eyes on us like spiders crawling up my spine. Had to check my boxers when we got back to make sure I hadn't actually shit myself.,28,54
1q1ao8q,,"Back at camp, Plato collapsed into our tent and was asleep within seconds, the cube still clutched in his fist. I sat outside, shaking, watching the tree line for movement.",30,55
1q1ao8q,,Wondering if those things could cross into the clearing. Wondering if they were already here and I just couldn't see them yet.,22,56
1q1ao8q,,"___

I must have dozed off eventually because I woke to shouting. The whole camp was up, crowding toward the shack. Dawn was just breaking.",25,57
1q1ao8q,,"I scrambled out of the tent and ran after them, my heart already sinking because I knew, I fucking knew something had gone wrong.",24,58
1q1ao8q,,"Jim was standing on the shack's collapsing porch, holding the cube above his head like a prophet with a holy relic.",21,59
1q1ao8q,,"His eyes were wild, spit flying from his mouth as he preached to the gathered crew in a voice that cracked and soared.",23,60
1q1ao8q,,"""You think this is a job?"" he shouted. ""You think they're paying you to dig? You're digging up a god's grave!",21,61
1q1ao8q,,You're bringing up pieces of something that was buried for a reason! The mountain kept them safe! Kept them sleeping!,20,62
1q1ao8q,,"And we're waking them up piece by piece!""

The crew was paralyzed. Not by his words. By something deeper. That contagious hysteria that turns crowds into mobs.",27,63
1q1ao8q,,"I could see it spreading. The wide eyes, the shaking hands, They moved together like they were all tuned to the same fucked-up radio station.",25,64
1q1ao8q,,"""We have to give it back!"" Jim screamed, shaking the cube. ""Put it back in the hole! Put it all back before—""

Buzz came out of nowhere.",27,65
1q1ao8q,,A straight punch to Jim's jaw that sent him sprawling off the porch into the dirt. The cube tumbled from his hand.,22,66
1q1ao8q,,"Buzz scooped it up, triumph and rage warring on his face. Then he went pale. I watched the color drain from his skin as his fingers closed around the cube.",30,67
1q1ao8q,,His eyes went wide. His mouth opened but no sound came out. He was feeling it. Whatever Plato felt. Whatever Jim felt.,22,68
1q1ao8q,,The wrongness of it singing directly into his nervous system. His hand shook. The cube nearly slipped from his fingers.,20,69
1q1ao8q,,"""Work's called off today,"" he said in a thin, hollow voice. ""Everybody... everybody just stay in camp. Don't go near the hole.""

His authority died right there.",27,70
1q1ao8q,,You could see it in the crew's faces. Fear was one thing. Orders from a scared man were nothing.,19,71
1q1ao8q,,"He stumbled away toward his trailer, still clutching the cube, moving like he'd aged thirty years in thirty seconds. Figured Jim must've jacked it while we were passed out.",29,72
1q1ao8q,,"I booked it back to camp, but Plato was gone. Fucking gone.",12,73
1q1ao8q,,"That night, drunk on whatever cheap vodka he'd smuggled up the mountain, Buzz tried to get his power back the old-fashioned way.",22,74
1q1ao8q,,"He found Jim at the edge of camp and pulled a knife. ""You made me look weak,"" he slurred, swaying on his feet. ""In front of the whole fucking crew.",30,75
1q1ao8q,,"Nobody does that. Nobody.""

Jim didn't flinch. Just looked at him with that hollow, resigned expression. ""You did that yourself the second you touched the cube.""

Buzz lunged.",28,76
1q1ao8q,,What happened next took maybe three seconds but felt like watching a nature documentary.,14,77
1q1ao8q,,"Jim moved with the casual efficiency of someone who'd been in a hundred bar fights and knew exactly how much violence was necessary. He sidestepped, caught Buzz's wrist, twisted.",29,78
1q1ao8q,,"The knife clattered into the dirt. Then Jim picked up his own knife from his belt, looked at it for a long moment, and threw it into the dark woods.",30,79
1q1ao8q,,"""I'm not fighting you,"" he said quietly.",7,80
1q1ao8q,,"""The mountain's enemy enough for all of us.""

Buzz stood there, disarmed and humiliated, making sounds that might have been crying or might have been laughter.",26,81
1q1ao8q,,He screamed something incoherent at the sky and stumbled away into the dark. The crew watched in silence. Nobody helped him. Nobody followed.,23,82
1q1ao8q,,"""Gentlemen.""

The voice came from the darkness beyond the generator lights. Soft. Polite. Utterly chilling.",15,83
1q1ao8q,,"Joseph stepped into the clearing like he'd been waiting there all along, briefcase in hand, suit somehow still pristine.",19,84
1q1ao8q,,He didn't acknowledge Buzz's screaming or Jim's knife or the cube lying in the dirt.,15,85
1q1ao8q,,"Just looked at us with those empty eyes and delivered his message in a voice that could've been discussing quarterly earnings. ""Stakeholder engagement indicates suboptimal velocity on deliverables.",28,86
1q1ao8q,,We're pivoting to an accelerated extraction model with enhanced productivity metrics: Get more stones within seventy-two hours. No more distractions. No more delays.,23,87
1q1ao8q,,"Inability to achieve these benchmarks will necessitate resource reallocation and talent optimization strategies.""

He let that last word hang in the cold air. Replacement. Not termination. Not firing. Replacement.",29,88
1q1ao8q,,"Then he turned and walked back into the darkness, dress shoes crunching on gravel, and was gone. Nobody slept that night.",21,89
1q1ao8q,,"We just sat around the dying fire, not talking, not looking at each other. Buzz's screaming had faded to whimpering somewhere in the woods.",24,90
1q1ao8q,,"The cube sat in the dirt where Jim had dropped it, and nobody wanted to touch it. Woke up feeling like someone had taken a dump in my skull.",29,91
1q1ao8q,,"Gray as hell and twice as depressing. No Buzz. No orders. The crew just sat there, listless and waiting for something they couldn't name.",24,92
1q1ao8q,,"Jim was the one who noticed the winch cable was taut. ""That's weighted,"" he said, voice flat. ""Someone's on the line.""

We gathered at the edge.",26,93
1q1ao8q,,"The cable stretched down into the hole, disappearing into that perfect darkness, pulled tight under significant weight. ""Buzz?"" someone called down. No answer. Just the hole's breathing.",27,94
1q1ao8q,,"It took four of us to work the winch, hauling up whatever was down there. The cable groaned. Something heavy. Something wrong.",22,95
1q1ao8q,,"Twenty feet down, on the narrow ledge where that first boulder sat, we saw him. Buzz. Not fallen. Placed.",19,96
1q1ao8q,,"Sitting upright with his back against the cut earth, head lolled to one side, eyes wide open and staring at nothing. His skin was dry and pale, like paper.",29,97
1q1ao8q,,No blood. No wounds. No sign of struggle. He just looked empty. Scooped out from the inside. His pocket was turned inside out. The cube was gone.,27,98
1q1ao8q,,Message received loud and clear. The hole don't like losers. Don't like smartasses either. Buzz fucked around and found out. We left him there.,24,99
1q1ao8q,,"Nobody said it out loud, but we all knew going down to retrieve him meant becoming the next thing placed on that ledge.",23,100
1q1ao8q,,"As I turned over to the hole, and saw Plato, just looking down at him, nothing much to say. Joseph appeared at lunch with new envelopes. Thicker ones.",28,101
1q1ao8q,,"""Incentive bonuses,"" he said in that soft voice. ""For continued dedication.""

""We took them. Course we fucking took them. I'd been eating ketchup packets for lunch.",26,102
1q1ao8q,,"Joseph could've been Satan himself and I'd still have taken that blood money.""

And that afternoon, we went back to digging.",21,103
1q1ao8q,,"___

*There's little Tom Dacre, who cried when his head*

*That curled like a lambs back, was shaved, so I said.*

[Part 2](

[Part 3](

I called my mom while I was still parked on the side of the road.",21,0
1q191kn,,"She answered the way she always does, like she’d been holding her phone and waiting for it to ring. “Hey,” she said carefully.",23,1
1q191kn,,"“Are you okay?”

I stared at the empty stretch of asphalt ahead of me, my headlights washing over nothing. “I’m not,” I said.",23,2
1q191kn,,"“But I will be.”

There was a pause. “What do you mean?” she asked. “I’m done running,” I told her.",20,3
1q191kn,,"“I’m done waiting for him to decide what happens next.”

Her breathing changed immediately. “What are you talking about?” she asked. “I’m ending this,” I said. “Tonight.”

Silence.",28,4
1q191kn,,"“End it how?” she asked quietly. “He told me where to go,” I said. “He wants me there.”

Another pause, longer this time. “Where?” she asked. I told her.",29,5
1q191kn,,"The house where I grew up. The one that’s been empty for years. The one he mentioned like it still belonged to him. She inhaled sharply. “Oh God,” she whispered.",30,6
1q191kn,,"“Please, you don’t have to.”

“I need you to listen,” I said. “I’m not asking for permission. I just need you to know where I am.”

She started talking then.",30,7
1q191kn,,Telling me to wait. Telling me to call the police again. Telling me she could come with me.,18,8
1q191kn,,"“I love you,” I said, because it felt important to say it out loud. Her voice broke.",17,9
1q191kn,,"“I love you too.”

I hung up before she could say anything else that might make me turn around. The balloons were already there when I arrived.",27,10
1q191kn,,"Bright red, blue, and yellow, tied neatly to the mailbox like someone had taken the time to make sure they wouldn’t blow away.",23,11
1q191kn,,"They bobbed gently in the wind, cheerful and wrong. Every light in the house was on.",16,12
1q191kn,,"I stood across the road for a long time, my car idling quietly, trying to convince myself that if I waited long enough, something would change. Nothing did.",28,13
1q191kn,,The front door was unlocked. The living room looked like a party supply store had exploded. Streamers hung from the ceiling. Balloons crowded the corners.,25,14
1q191kn,,"Confetti littered the floor, untouched, like it had been thrown hours ago and left exactly where it landed.",18,15
1q191kn,,"In the center of the room, the dining table had been dragged forward. Two place settings. Two glasses. And a cake. White frosting. Blue trim.",25,16
1q191kn,,Candles already pressed into the top. My name written neatly across it. My hand went to my phone automatically. I didn’t even look at the screen when I hit record.,30,17
1q191kn,,"The camera opened. Then froze. The screen dimmed, flickered once, and went completely black. Not off. Just… dead. I pressed the power button. Nothing. Held it down. Tried again. Nothing.",30,18
1q191kn,,"Panic crept up my spine. “That won’t work,” a voice said behind me. I turned. He stood near the hallway, fully illuminated. In uniform. Dark blue. Badge catching the light.",30,19
1q191kn,,Duty belt secured neatly around his waist. The radio clipped to his shoulder like it belonged there.,17,20
1q191kn,,"Seeing him dressed like that, in a place like this, made my stomach turn.",14,21
1q191kn,,"“You work long enough,” he said calmly, “you learn some tricks along the way.”

He glanced at my phone. “Put it down,” he said.",24,22
1q191kn,,"“You don’t need that.”

I didn’t move. He sighed, slow and patient. “You always were stubborn,” he said. “Sit.”

I looked at the chair across from the cake.",28,23
1q191kn,,"“I just wanted a real celebration,” he continued, stepping closer. “All those years I missed. I thought we could finally do it right.”

His hand hovered near his holster.",29,24
1q191kn,,"The gun came out smoothly, already pointed at me. I froze. He watched my reaction for a moment, then slowly placed the gun on the table between us.",28,25
1q191kn,,"That gesture scared me more than the weapon itself. “Sit,” he said again. I sat. He struck a match and lit the candle. The flame wavered, then steadied.",28,26
1q191kn,,"“Go on,” he said. “Make a wish.”

My hands were shaking. “Why?” I asked. “Why me?”

His expression softened, like I’d finally asked the right question. “It’s simple,” he said.",30,27
1q191kn,,"“You needed guidance. Your father was a terrible influence. Unstable. Violent. It was my job to protect you. To keep you on the right path.”

He tilted his head slightly.",30,28
1q191kn,,"“And sometimes,” he added, “protecting someone means removing a problem.”

My stomach twisted. “I missed so many birthdays,” he said.",20,29
1q191kn,,"“I thought we could make up for lost time.”

He bent down and reached under the table. “Your present,” he said cheerfully.",22,30
1q191kn,,"He slid a neatly wrapped box toward me, finished with a blue bow. “Open it.”

I didn’t want to touch it. “Open it,” he repeated.",25,31
1q191kn,,My fingers felt numb as I lifted the lid. Inside were photographs. Hundreds of them. Me at different ages. School events. Outside apartments. Walking down streets I barely remembered.,29,32
1q191kn,,Copies of every birthday card. Police reports. Domestic call logs. Notes written neatly in the margins. I recognized one photo immediately.,21,33
1q191kn,,"I was seven, standing in the driveway with my bike. The same day my mom said someone must have “forgotten to sign the card.”

I’d never seen that picture before.",30,34
1q191kn,,"“I wanted to remember all of this,” he said as I flipped through them. “And I wanted YOU to remember it too.”

My throat tightened.",25,35
1q191kn,,"“The first time we met,” he continued. “The first card. Watching you grow up. I was so proud of you.”

Something inside me snapped.",24,36
1q191kn,,I stood and hurled the box at him. Photos exploded across the room. I lunged. He was faster. We crashed into the table.,23,37
1q191kn,,"The cake hit the floor, frosting smearing across the carpet. I grabbed for the gun, but he slammed me backward, sending me sprawling. He was on me instantly.",28,38
1q191kn,,"His weight crushed the air out of my lungs. His fists came down hard, controlled at first, then wild. “Ungrateful!” he shouted, hitting me again.",25,39
1q191kn,,"“After everything I did for you!”

Stars burst behind my eyes. I tasted blood. He straddled me, raising his fist…

A loud BANG split the air.",26,40
1q191kn,,The pressure on my chest vanished. His body jerked violently. Another BANG followed. Something warm splashed across my shirt.,19,41
1q191kn,,"He slid off me and hit the floor with a heavy, unreal sound.",13,42
1q191kn,,"I lay there staring at the ceiling, ears ringing, lungs dragging in air like they didn’t know if they were allowed to anymore. Then I turned my head.",28,43
1q191kn,,"Blood spread across the front of his uniform, dark and fast, soaking into the fabric around the badge. His mouth worked soundlessly, chest hitching in wet, broken gasps.",28,44
1q191kn,,"And then I saw her. My mom stood in the doorway, both hands wrapped around the gun, arms locked straight like she was afraid they might move on their own.",30,45
1q191kn,,"Her face was pale, eyes wide and unfocused. We stared at each other. Neither of us spoke. The only sound in the room was his troubled breathing.",27,46
1q191kn,,"I staggered to my feet and crossed the room, taking the gun from her hands before she could drop it.",20,47
1q191kn,,"I pulled her into me and she collapsed against my chest. “I’m sorry,” she whispered over and over. “I’m so sorry.”

Behind us, he wheezed.",25,48
1q191kn,,"His hand twitched, then fumbled weakly toward his shoulder. His fingers brushed the radio, missed, tried again. He pressed the button. “Officer down,” he rasped.",25,49
1q191kn,,"“I’ve been shot.”

The words came out automatic. Practiced. Red and blue lights flooded the windows moments later. Sirens screamed. I told my mom to breathe. To stay calm.",29,50
1q191kn,,"Not to run. I wanted it to be over. The front door burst open. The house filled with noise. Boots pounding hardwood, radios crackling, voices sharp and overlapping.",28,51
1q191kn,,"Someone grabbed my arm and pulled me away from her. I stumbled, frosting and blood smeared across my clothes. “Hands where I can see them.”

I complied without thinking.",29,52
1q191kn,,My mom tried to turn toward me. Tried to say my name. Another officer stepped between us and guided her away. I heard the cuffs before I saw them.,29,53
1q191kn,,"The sound hit harder than the gunshots. “It’s okay,” I said. I don’t know who it was for.",18,54
1q191kn,,"“I’m right here.”

She nodded, crying silently as they led her past me. They sat me on the couch and asked questions I barely processed. My name.",27,55
1q191kn,,If I was hurt. If there were other weapons. I answered automatically. I watched them give him CPR. The radio on his shoulder crackled once as they started chest compressions.,30,56
1q191kn,,Back at the precinct we told them everything. Exactly what happened. My mom confessed to shooting him but only to protect me. They let me go.,26,57
1q191kn,,They didn’t let her go. He died before morning. This all happened days ago. The house is still taped off. My mom is still waiting for trial.,27,58
1q191kn,,"On paper, there were no threats. No recordings. Just a dead cop and a woman who pulled the trigger. The threat is gone. But it doesn’t feel like it.",29,59
1q191kn,,"It feels like he planned this too. Like even now, somewhere in the system, he’s still one step ahead.",19,60
1q191kn,,And I don’t know how long it will take before that feeling fades…or if it ever will.,17,61
1q18if2,Did you lock the front door?,"“Did you lock the door?” I say to myself as I lie in bed. This feeling of anxiety is overtaking me, just thinking about that damn door.",27,0
1q18if2,,"I checked it before I went to bed, but that same horrible feeling overtakes me while I try to shut my eyes.",22,1
1q18if2,,"I take a deep breath and exhale slowly, trying to recall my therapy sessions. We set up a plan to reel in my compulsions or to at least delay them.",30,2
1q18if2,,"This has worked with my other habits to a certain extent, but of all things, my front door is the worst one.",22,3
1q18if2,,"I check without realising with a quick shake of the door handle, and off I go, but minutes later I feel the urge to check again.",26,4
1q18if2,,This started a few months ago when I first moved in.,11,5
1q18if2,,"At first, it felt great to gain my independence, but when the sun went down and the darkness rolled in, I couldn’t stop myself from looking at my door down the hall.",32,6
1q18if2,,"The once secure, dense door with a strong lock and key felt like it had been replaced by a piece of plywood hanging off its hinges, with me thinking that if it went unchecked, someone would replace it without me looking.",41,7
1q18if2,,"So slowly over time, I began to check the door just once every hour, then it would slowly be whittled down to every 5 minutes after it got dark.",29,8
1q18if2,,"This shortly made living normally extremely difficult, especially since I was allowed to work from home, so I never got a break from my tendencies, leaving me exhausted.",28,9
1q18if2,,"After confiding in some of my friends about my rituals, they convinced me to start seeking therapy before it got any worse.",22,10
1q18if2,,"It was difficult at first, opening up to a stranger about my OCD they had expressed many times about how they would not judge me on what I told them, but this feeling of someone’s hand clutching my stomach had only ceased after a few sessions.",46,11
1q18if2,,"But when this stopped, I could finally talk about my life as a whole, from past mistakes and trauma to the small things my OCD had latched onto in my life, making daily tasks difficult, and then finally, my front door.",41,12
1q18if2,,"The progress was slow, but nonetheless was still progress before I knew it.",13,13
1q18if2,,"After a few weeks, I worked myself back to only checking on it once every thirty minutes, then to an hour.",21,14
1q18if2,,"I felt great, thinking I was well on my way back to a sense of normalcy, but every time I went to bed, the same question haunted me.",28,15
1q18if2,,"“Did you lock the door?”

It had felt like my progress was turning into failure despite what my therapist was telling me.",22,16
1q18if2,,"“This is fine, you’ll overcome this, just give yourself time.” It was falling on deaf ears.",16,17
1q18if2,,"I was doing my best not to spiral, but when you're faced with a wall every time you go to bed at night, you start to lose hope.",28,18
1q18if2,,"I get less sleep, which means I fall behind at work, which means I risk my job status, all because of one stupid question on my mind.",27,19
1q18if2,,"So while I sit here with my eyes shut, trying my best to fall asleep, I couldn't feel more awake.",20,20
1q18if2,,"My mind's eye was busy drifting down the hall, then down the stairs, across my creaking floorboards to a broken, worn-down piece of wood, leaving me with a clear view of the doorknob slowly turning, with an agonizingly slow creak, the door opens, letting a shadow stroll into my home.",50,21
1q18if2,,"“I give up” I say to myself, pushing off the bed, doing my walk of shame out of the bedroom, stopping briefly by the bathroom to splash some water on my face.",32,22
1q18if2,,"Still thinking about the progress I was losing tonight. “I’ll try again tomorrow,"" I say to myself, full well knowing that I don’t mean it.",25,23
1q18if2,,"I’ll be back here tomorrow night, looking in the mirror, giving the same excuses. I step back into the hallway, feeling for my keys in my sweatpants with little luck.",30,24
1q18if2,,"“Probably next to my bed” I thought to myself, stepping back into my bedroom. I froze in place as a cool breeze hit me. My window was open.",28,25
1q18if2,,I stayed still for what felt like hours.,8,26
1q18if2,,"“I hadn’t opened it, had I?” My thoughts ran wild and scattered, but all of my questions were simultaneously answered in one quick moment when I heard a faint creak from the floorboards just behind my bedroom door, alongside the faintest sound of someone breathing with a slight hitch to it as if they couldn't contain their excitement.",58,27
1q18if2,,"I backed away slowly, then almost tripping over myself, I turned and fled down the stairs, each step being made louder by the overall silence of the dead of night.",30,28
1q18if2,,"But above my fleeting footsteps, I could still hear their heavy boots stomping against the floor, leaving the bedroom, but with no urgency to them, almost as if they had all the time in the world.",36,29
1q18if2,,"Running across the bottom floor, I practically threw myself at the door, but even after all this, now more than ever, that same question hammered in my mind.",28,30
1q18if2,,"I shook the door handle violently with tears in my eyes, pleading with this now stronger than iron door to free me while listening to those footsteps come to a stop shortly behind me with a jingle in their pocket and a tone of mischief as they asked me a question I already knew the answer to.",57,31

1q187l6,The Devil's Revolver,"On the fourth day of my six-day backpacking trip through the Mojave Desert, I saw a pile of ash off the beaten path.",23,0
1q187l6,,"Old campfire sites are a common sight on a multi-day hike, but something about this one caught my eye. A reflective black rock was resting on top of the ash.",30,1
1q187l6,,"It looked like a meteorite. Curious, I approached and picked it up. It was small enough to hold in one hand, and slightly warm to the touch.",27,2
1q187l6,,"Immediately, I realized it was a tablet. Not the new kind of tablet, obviously, but an ancient-looking stone tablet with writing on it.",23,3
1q187l6,,The engraving was in a dark red—slightly lighter than the pitch-black stone it was engraved on—and almost seemed to glow in the scorching midday sun.,25,4
1q187l6,,"It didn't seem to be in English, but, oddly, I could read its message easily. Somehow, its text became perfectly legible when I concentrated on the strange letters.",28,5
1q187l6,,"This was what I read:

---

-TYRANT UPON THY THRONE-

-SOVEREIGN OF NOTHING-

-MAY DEATH AND ASH-

-HERALD THY RETURN-

---

I looked down at the ominous stone tablet, uneasy.",30,6
1q187l6,,"It creeped me out. *Who left this here?* I wondered, unsettled.",11,7
1q187l6,,"*What a bizarre find.*

I shrugged, put it in my pack, and was about to walk away when I saw something else. Removing the tablet revealed something beneath.",28,8
1q187l6,,"I brushed the ash off—without picking it up—to see what it was. A gun. I gazed down, incredulously, at a huge, black revolver.",23,9
1q187l6,,A veritable hand cannon that seemed to be made out of the same meteorite as the tablet. The grip was a cloudy gray and blended in with the ash.,29,10
1q187l6,,It looked unique— and *extremely* expensive. Now this was an *incredible* find. Who would leave a collector's gun in the ashes of a campfire?,24,11
1q187l6,,"I wiped the sweat from my eyes, took a swig of water from my canteen, and dropped my backpack off to the side. This deserved my full attention.",28,12
1q187l6,,"Crouching down, I wrapped my right hand around the grip of the revolver and carefully pulled it from the ash. It was heavy, but felt perfect in my hand.",29,13
1q187l6,,"In fact, I felt better just by holding it. My fatigue from walking in the blistering heat started to fade away. I couldn't feel the soreness in my legs.",29,14
1q187l6,,My thoughts were clearer.,4,15
1q187l6,,"I wasn't a gun nut or anything, but my friends had taken me to a shooting range a few times, so I knew how to use one.",27,16
1q187l6,,"I thumbed the cylinder release and flicked my wrist to swing it out. There were six chambers in the revolver's cylinder, and none of them were loaded...",27,17
1q187l6,,but one chamber was dark. A strange shadow where a bullet would have been. I couldn't see my hand through the chamber when I waved it on the other side.,30,18
1q187l6,,"*Weird,* I thought. I swung the cylinder shut and held the mysterious revolver in my hand for another minute, just enjoying the feel of it.",25,19
1q187l6,,"It really was a nice gun, and I was definitely taking it with me. Maybe I'd become a gun nut after all. I went to put it in my pack.",30,20
1q187l6,,"With my hand inside the backpack, I tried to let go of the revolver. I couldn't let go. *Huh?*

I tried shaking it out of my hand.",27,21
1q187l6,,"It wouldn't come off. Panicking, I took my right hand out of the pack and tried to pry the gun off with my left.",24,22
1q187l6,,"*Is it covered in glue?* I thought, increasingly concerned for the skin of my palm.",15,23
1q187l6,,"*Why can't I let go?*

I sat down and struggled with it, gritting my teeth as I tried to free my hand. *Come on,* I thought, muscles straining. *Get off.",30,24
1q187l6,,"Get off! GET. OFF—*

The revolver disappeared. My left arm was almost dislocated as the object I was pulling on stopped existing. I blinked. I raised my empty right hand.",30,25
1q187l6,,"I stared at it. I slowly opened and closed it a few times. Silence. ""What the hell—""

The sun disappeared and everything plunged into darkness.",25,26
1q187l6,,"""—is going on?"" I said to myself, before jumping to my feet in shock.",14,27
1q187l6,,"Adrenaline flooded my body, overpowering a sudden wave of exhaustion that hit me at the same time. The desert was gone; I stood on cobblestone.",25,28
1q187l6,,The sunlight was gone; it was pitch dark. I was somewhere else.,12,29
1q187l6,,"I froze for a moment, dumbfounded, as my brain tried to process all of the impossible things happening to me. My hands were shaking. I was hyperventilating.",27,30
1q187l6,,"*What...* I thought slowly, *...what just happened?*

I was freaking out.",11,31
1q187l6,,"*Where is the gun?*

*Where is my backpack?*

*Where did the desert go?*

The most important question occurred to me.",20,32
1q187l6,,"*Where am I?*

I whipped my head around in every direction. *WHERE AM I?!* My heart was racing.",18,33
1q187l6,,"It looked like I was in the middle of a deserted city, on a cobblestone street lined with old, weathered brick houses.",22,34
1q187l6,,"There were no sidewalks, telephone wires, light poles, or anything a modern city would have. It was like I had gone backwards through time. There were no lights anywhere.",29,35
1q187l6,,"No fires, no lanterns, no lit windows. It was a ghost town. I looked up, and saw only darkness. No stars, no moon. Nothing. It was just pitch black, *everywhere*.",30,36
1q187l6,,"I didn't know how I was even able to see, but I wasn't in the state of mind to dwell on that. *Am I underground?* I thought, still panicking.",29,37
1q187l6,,"*Why am I here? HOW?!*

I was overwhelmed. It was too much. What was I going to do? I doubled over, hands on my knees, trying to control my breathing.",30,38
1q187l6,,"I needed to calm down. I needed to figure this out. There was a rational explanation... somewhere. I had to find it. After a minute, I had mostly recovered.",29,39
1q187l6,,I took my hands from my knees and straightened up. My first thought was to look for help. I needed someone to tell me where I was.,27,40
1q187l6,,"They could give me directions, and possibly an explanation for how I got here. *""Hello?""* I called out tentatively, praying that this city wasn't truly abandoned.",26,41
1q187l6,,"*""Is anyone there?""*

Dead silence. An unnatural chill went down my spine. Dread. I felt it growing from every direction.",20,42
1q187l6,,"Like a thousand hands pressing down on me from all sides. An unnatural feeling, almost like a sixth sense. A sense of danger.",23,43
1q187l6,,I needed to get out of this city. Now. Something was wrong here. I started jogging towards an intersection I could see in the distance.,25,44
1q187l6,,There had to be more in this city than the houses surrounding me. Maybe I could find a way out by myself.,22,45
1q187l6,,"Passing by an alley, I caught a glimpse of something that may have been a large rat scurrying away. I didn't stop to look.",24,46
1q187l6,,"Once I reached the three-way intersection, I could see down the two streets that branched off to the sides. More houses.",21,47
1q187l6,,"I must have been in the suburbs of the city, and I had no idea which direction would get me out of them.",23,48
1q187l6,,It was time to explore one of the houses. There might be a clue to where I was.,18,49
1q187l6,,"Aside from that, I was curious to see if people had ever lived here.",14,50
1q187l6,,"Walking up to the brick house facing the intersection, I stopped in front of its plain wooden door. Not expecting an answer, I knocked.",24,51
1q187l6,,"It was better to be safe in case someone was actually in there. To my surprise, someone answered. *""Come in!""* a jovial man's voice called out from inside.",28,52
1q187l6,,"*""Please, come in! I can't come to the door!""*

Slightly relieved to hear a friendly voice in this oppressive place, I opened the door and went in.",27,53
1q187l6,,"What I saw when I entered the foyer was refreshingly normal: a small coat rack, shoes on the floor, a mat to wipe your feet, and an umbrella resting next to the door.",33,54
1q187l6,,I could see the living room ahead of me. These houses weren't abandoned after all. I closed the front door.,20,55
1q187l6,,"""Please, make yourself comfortable!"" the boisterous voice exclaimed from a different room. ""You'll have to forgive me, I wasn't expecting guests!",21,56
1q187l6,,"You caught me making dinner— please, just take a seat in the living room.""

His voice had an overwhelming charisma to it.",22,57
1q187l6,,I felt like this guy made friends as easily as he breathed. Someone who could make anyone laugh—who brightened a room just by their presence.,25,58
1q187l6,,"I could almost hear his smile. ""Thank you!"" I called out as I stepped into the living room.",18,59
1q187l6,,"""I'm a bit lost, and could use some help.""

""Of course!"" he replied. I heard sounds of cutlery. ""Always happy to help someone in need.",25,60
1q187l6,,"Just a moment!""

I took in the living room as I waited. I still felt uneasy, but what I saw calmed me down a bit.",25,61
1q187l6,,There were two small couches facing each other in the center of the room. Glass coffee tables topped with ashtrays were in front of both.,25,62
1q187l6,,"Lining the walls were bookcases and landscape paintings, and the wall facing the street had two windows.",17,63
1q187l6,,"It was a perfect room to relax and socialize with others, which fit the general impression I had of my host. Behind me, I heard a noise.",27,64
1q187l6,,"I turned around—and recoiled in horror. He was standing in a doorway, holding a butcher's cleaver. It wasn't the cleaver that frightened me. It was his face.",27,65
1q187l6,,"Or the lack of one. He had no eyes, nose, or mouth. Instead, a vertical opening full of bristling, razor-sharp teeth split his face in two.",26,66
1q187l6,,"I jumped backwards and screamed, ""GET BACK!"" This was a nightmare. ""GET AWAY FROM ME!""

He took a step forward. ""Please, relax,"" he said in a comforting voice.",28,67
1q187l6,,"His ""mouth"" quivered hideously as he spoke. ""Don't worry. I'm here to help you.""

My body was shaking from fear. I didn't know what to do. I couldn't think.",29,68
1q187l6,,"""STOP!"" I shouted frantically as I took another step back. I had to do something. I had to do something *now*. I put my right hand behind my back.",29,69
1q187l6,,"""I'LL SHOOT YOU!"" I screamed, voice cracking. ""I HAVE A GUN!"" It was a bluff, but I wished it were true. I desperately needed the gun right now.",28,70
1q187l6,,"Suddenly, my right hand was weighed down, wrapping around a familiar grip.",12,71
1q187l6,,"Not questioning this miracle, I pulled the black revolver from behind my back and quickly leveled it at him. ""DON'T MOVE!"" I yelled.",23,72
1q187l6,,"The gun wasn't loaded, but I prayed it was enough to scare him off. He cocked his head to the side as he considered the large revolver trained on him.",30,73
1q187l6,,"""This is just a big misunderstanding,"" he said, reasonably. He shrugged and held out the cleaver. ""It's not what it looks like.""

He took another step forward. I hesitated.",29,74
1q187l6,,"Faster than I could blink, he lunged at me. With a merciless swing of his cleaver, he chopped off my right hand, sending it flying. The revolver disappeared.",28,75
1q187l6,,"*""AAAAHHHHHH!""* I cried out in shock and terror—the pain hadn't hit me yet—as I stumbled backwards, my hand replaced by a geyser of blood.",24,76
1q187l6,,"I tripped on a coffee table and crashed through it, shattering the glass and landing on my back.",18,77
1q187l6,,The monster wasn't wasting time—he immediately recovered from his brutal attack and jumped forward to finish me off. His cleaver was raised high as he bore down on me.,29,78
1q187l6,,"His vertical maw was fully opened, revealing dozens of viciously sharp teeth. He was eerily silent as he brought the cleaver down. My death was imminent.",26,79
1q187l6,,"My thoughts were frozen by fear. I screamed, watching the smooth arc of his cleaver as it approached my face.",20,80
1q187l6,,"I uselessly put up my remaining hand to protect myself, even as I realized it was futile. I acted by reflex.",21,81
1q187l6,,"The black revolver appeared in my left hand and I pulled the trigger. **—BOOM—**

All of the furniture in the room exploded into a hail of splinters. The windows shattered.",30,82
1q187l6,,The floor cracked around me and the building shook. The air in the room became a gale as it fled in terror.,22,83
1q187l6,,It was so loud that my eardrums should have burst. It was so bright that my retinas should have fried.,20,84
1q187l6,,It was so powerful that the recoil should have ripped my arm off.,13,85
1q187l6,,"A path of annihilation about two feet wide began at the muzzle of the barrel and ended in the sky, which was now visible through the gaping hole in the ceiling.",31,86
1q187l6,,Everything in that path had turned to dust. Half of the monster's body had simply disappeared.,16,87
1q187l6,,"The rest became a spray of gore and bloody mist from the muzzle blast, splattering around the room.",18,88
1q187l6,,"His cleaver—inches from my face—was thrown from his obliterated fingers, and its mangled remnants were embedded into one of the brick walls. Shell-shocked, I lurched to my feet.",28,89
1q187l6,,I staggered to the front door before the dust could settle.,11,90
1q187l6,,The stump of my missing right hand was still bleeding—the pain creeping in—and I pressed it into my left armpit.,20,91
1q187l6,,My revolver hung heavy by my side as I gripped it tight. I threw the front door open—and froze. My ragged breath caught. What I saw had stopped me cold.,30,92
1q187l6,,"Blood from my wound rolled down my good arm, my white-knuckled hand, the revolver, and dripped to the ground as I took it all in. Demons.",26,93
1q187l6,,That was the only way I could describe them. They were completely surrounding the empty intersection in front of me. A horde. An army. Filling the streets.,27,94
1q187l6,,"Crowding shoulder-to-shoulder, as far as the eye could see. Demons.",10,95
1q187l6,,"Most were the split-faced monstrosities like the one I had just killed, but I could see other kinds scattered among them.",21,96
1q187l6,,"I saw dozens of skinless people, slick with blood and frightening with their rictus grins. Exposed muscles visibly coiled and uncoiled with every movement.",24,97
1q187l6,,They twitched erratically and their lidless stares were hungry. Some jumbled masses of writhing tentacles the size of dogs were floating a few feet off the ground.,27,98
1q187l6,,"They bobbed up and down in a bizarre rhythm, and I couldn't tell how deadly they were.",17,99
1q187l6,,"Two or three tall, thin humanoids resembling stick figures towered over the demons near them.",15,100
1q187l6,,"Their spindly, long arms narrowed down to evil points that could easily spear through a chest.",16,101
1q187l6,,"Where a face should have been was an empty cavity that exposed their hollow heads. I saw at least one gigantic spider, larger than a bear, with no eyes.",29,102
1q187l6,,"It was pale, hairy, and had huge, arm-length fangs. Disgusting holes covered its entire body, and countless ""baby"" spiders—the size of tarantulas—were crawling in and out of them.",28,103
1q187l6,,"There were more, but my concentration was broken. Whispers. I didn't hear them with my ears. The whispers were in my head. An insidious susurration of seemingly thousands of people.",30,104
1q187l6,,"None of it made sense—it was maddening. It was impossible to ignore. I could tell, somehow, that they were coming from behind me, on the other side of the house.",30,105
1q187l6,,"At that same moment, the dread I was feeling from every direction suddenly spiked from the place the whispers originated.",20,106
1q187l6,,I knew instinctively that it was far more dangerous than every demon in front of me combined. The whispers were getting louder.,22,107
1q187l6,,I ran away from it to the only place I could: the empty intersection. None of the demons made a move on me.,23,108
1q187l6,,"When I looked behind me and over the house—

I saw it. It was flying. It was gigantic.",18,109
1q187l6,,And it was the single most terrifying thing I had ever seen in my entire life. My heart thundered in my ears. I didn't even think.,26,110
1q187l6,,I raised the revolver and fired three times. **—BOOM—** An explosion of light broke the darkness. Cobblestone on the ground shook loose in front of me.,26,111
1q187l6,,Dust went flying across the street.,6,112
1q187l6,,**—BOOM—** Pieces of cobblestone were thrown so forcefully by the muzzle blast that they became projectiles; windows shattered and demons raised arms to defend themselves.,25,113
1q187l6,,"**—BOOM—** A maelstrom surrounded me as the air desperately kept trying to return, only to be blown away once again.",20,114
1q187l6,,"Dirt under the stripped cobblestone was kicked up into the air. Silence. The whispers stopped. Dust swirled, obscuring my vision. *I killed it,* I thought, praying.",26,115
1q187l6,,"*Please let it be dead.*

The dust settled. It was completely unharmed. The *thing* flying in the air defied description. It was an abomination.",24,116
1q187l6,,Even the smallest attempt to understand its form would impart a lifetime of crippling nightmares. It was anathema to the human mind.,22,117
1q187l6,,"If I had to define it in that moment, I would say that it was vaguely humanoid in shape.",19,118
1q187l6,,It had an uncountable number of tendrils surrounding it that seemed to phase in and out of existence in a meaningless pattern.,22,119
1q187l6,,"I couldn't describe what color the tendrils were or what they were made of, because I had never seen any color or material like it before. It was alien.",29,120
1q187l6,,"None of that was noteworthy compared to the center of its body. There, I saw the Abyss. A maw of Hell. It wasn't black. It was Nothing. An unfathomable absence.",30,121
1q187l6,,It was the opposite of looking at the Sun. It didn't overwhelm the eyes. It took from them. It stole something from the mind.,24,122
1q187l6,,"In that moment, I knew that the gun was protecting me somehow.",12,123
1q187l6,,"I knew that if a normal person had looked directly into that void, they would have instantly gone insane. A slave to unspeakable madness— forever. The silence was broken.",29,124
1q187l6,,"***FRAGMENT BEARER***

I screamed. A sickening spike of pure agony was being driven behind my eyes. The *thing*'s whispers had combined into an infernal roar.",25,125
1q187l6,,"***ASPIRANT TO THE ASHEN THRONE***

I felt like my skull was going to shatter. It was a cacophony of the damned; a million raging souls, piercing my mind.",28,126

I didn't miss. It wasn't stopping, and it was getting larger.",25,164

Instantly, I was back in the desert. The stars shone down from the night sky overhead.",22,179

Hey guys,

It’s been a while since… everything.",26,0
1q1319v,,"Since I became what I am now, what the house has made me. The family moved out shortly after that night. Margaret, David and Jamie… but they haven’t abandoned me.",30,1
1q1319v,,"They leave groceries at the doorstep, pay the bills online, check in from a distance. I can’t leave the house. Not really.",22,2
1q1319v,,"The air itself seems to push me back, the floors, the walls, the shadows - they all insist I stay. But I don’t fight it. Not anymore.",27,3
1q1319v,,"Jamie… he’s different now. Normal, peaceful, happy in ways he never could be before. He smiles again. He laughs. He’s just a child. His parents embrace him now.",28,4
1q1319v,,"I’ve watched out the window when they pull up to deliver me my essentials. I’ve seen them hug, hold hands, and be affectionate. They’re finally a normal family.",28,5
1q1319v,,"And I made it possible. That thought… It brings me a strange, terrible satisfaction. I know they’re grateful to me. That’s why they don’t abandon me.",26,6
1q1319v,,It would be easy - they could just walk away and no one would question it. No one would come knocking at their door. But they know what I did.,30,7
1q1319v,,"They know the sacrifice I made. But they never enter the house. And they know not to engage with me, to give me any attention, or affection..",27,8
1q1319v,,"They know that will make things worse. My days pass in strange rhythms. I wake with the house, or maybe the house wakes me.",24,9
1q1319v,,"I move through the rooms slowly, like I belong to the shadows now. I feed myself, care for myself, all without stepping outside.",23,10
1q1319v,,"I talk to myself sometimes - or maybe the house talks to me. I feel the pulse of its strength under the floorboards, in the walls, even in the air.",30,11
1q1319v,,I am changing. I can feel it. The darkness inside me grows. Patience turns to hunger.,16,12
1q1319v,,I feel it when I touch the basement door - the place where it all began.,16,13
1q1319v,,"Some nights, I keep it closed, carefully, reverently, as though sealing away something too wild even for me. Other nights… I embrace the pull.",24,14
1q1319v,,"I feel it rising through the floorboards, testing me, and I let it. I am stronger then. More alive than I ever felt as a human. The house is mine.",30,15
1q1319v,,"Its walls breathe, its shadows twist at my whim. I spend hours moving through it, watching, listening, waiting. Waiting for something to enter, to test me.",26,16
1q1319v,,"And when it comes, I will be ready. I am patient. I am clever. I am power. \----------- 

It’s a rainy evening.",22,17
1q1319v,,"The kind of rain that drizzles like needles, steady and cold. The street outside the house is empty except for a single boy in a hooded coat.",27,18
1q1319v,,"He’s young, maybe early teens, his sneakers soaked through, one earbud dangling loose.",13,19
1q1319v,,"He’s holding a clipboard under his arm - some kind of school collection, or raising funds for a basketball team. He glances at the house, frowning.",26,20
1q1319v,,"It looks abandoned from the outside. No lights on upstairs. Curtains drawn. But something about it makes him pause. He hesitates at the gate, peering through the iron bars.",29,21
1q1319v,,"The front garden is overgrown now, slick with rain. The air around the house feels… thicker somehow. He swallows and wipes water from his forehead.",25,22
1q1319v,,"Then he steps forward, up the cracked path to the front door. I felt him before he reached the gate - a young, pulsing warmth moving through the rain.",29,23
1q1319v,,"My eyes snapped open. The house’s heartbeat quickened, a low thrum in the floorboards. He approached, sneakers squelching in the wet path. He stopped at the porch, frowning.",28,24
1q1319v,,"The house looked abandoned from the outside, but something in it pulled him closer. I rose from the chair, slow and deliberate.",22,25
1q1319v,,"Shadows uncoiled from the corners and slithered after me as I crossed the hall. I could feel Valekar stirring inside me, its dark joy rising like a tide.",28,26
1q1319v,,"The boy hesitated, glanced at the windows, then knocked. Once. Twice. “Hello?” His voice cracked slightly. My fingers brushed the basement door as I passed it.",26,27
1q1319v,,"I always kept it closed now, but the power behind it thrummed through the wood. The longer I stood here, the stronger the current. It wanted release.",27,28
1q1319v,,"And tonight, I’d give it one. I stopped at the front door, laying my hand against the knob.",18,29
1q1319v,,"For a heartbeat, a flicker of the old me rose up - the one who once tried to save a boy instead of using him.",25,30
1q1319v,,Jamie’s laugh echoed in my head. But Jamie was safe. I had made sure of that. Now it was someone else’s turn.,22,31
1q1319v,,"I drew in a slow breath, focusing, channeling the shadows through me.",12,32
1q1319v,,"It was like pulling a storm from my chest, the negative energy curling around my arms and fingers, gathering at the door like a predator ready to pounce.",28,33
1q1319v,,"Outside, the boy knocked again. “Hello? Is someone there?”

The house hummed. The shadows hissed. My lips curled into a smile that wasn’t mine anymore.",25,34
1q1319v,,"I turned the knob, and the door creaked open, just enough to show a sliver of darkness inside. The shadows shifted eagerly behind me, ready to be released.",28,35
1q1319v,,"Tonight, I would feed them. Smiling a smile that isn’t mine anymore, I whisper through the opening:

“Come in.”",19,36
1q122f4,It is not like ordinary Mold,"I never planned to post this online. I am a researcher, not a storyteller. I catalog things. I label samples.",20,0
1q122f4,,I write incident reports that get buried under classification stamps and legal language. But what I encountered three months ago does not stay buried. It grows. It spreads.,28,1
1q122f4,,So I am writing this here. I worked at a private biomedical research facility in southern Europe.,17,2
1q122f4,,"I cannot name it, for reasons that will become obvious, but it specialized in extremophile fungi. Mold that thrives in places nothing else should. Reactor cooling systems. Deep-sea wrecks.",29,3
1q122f4,,Abandoned bunkers sealed since the Cold War. We told ourselves it was about medicine. Antibiotics. Regenerative tissue scaffolds. We said a lot of things.,24,4
1q122f4,,The specimen that ruined everything arrived in a steel transport coffin marked **MYC-117 / HELIX STRAIN**. That was its official designation.,21,5
1q122f4,,"Informally, the lab techs called it *Spiral Mold* because of how it grew. Not outward in fuzzy blooms, but inward, coiling, drilling into whatever it touched.",26,6
1q122f4,,"It came from an apartment building condemned after a tenant complained about “walls breathing.” The complaint was laughed off until three residents vanished and one was found catatonic in the stairwell, lungs filled with something that was not supposed to be there.",42,7
1q122f4,,My role was observation and neural response mapping. Which means I watched what it did to living tissue. Our primary test subject was labeled **PATIENT ECHO-9**.,26,8
1q122f4,,"Real name redacted, but I saw it once on an intake form before it disappeared into a shredder. Mid-30s. Male. Former construction worker. Exposure estimated at six weeks before retrieval.",30,9
1q122f4,,"By the time I met him, it was hard to tell where the patient ended and the contamination began.",19,10
1q122f4,,"Echo-9 was kept in a negative-pressure isolation chamber, walls layered with antimicrobial polymers that cost more than my apartment. Tubes threaded into his chest, his spine, his skull.",28,11
1q122f4,,"The mold had colonized his nervous system without killing him. That was the miracle, according to the higher-ups. It kept him alive. Too alive.",24,12
1q122f4,,The first thing I noticed was that he tracked movement with his eyes even when sedated. Not just people. Shadows. Reflections in the glass.,24,13
1q122f4,,"Once, when the lights flickered, his pupils dilated so wide I could not see the whites anymore. We logged vocalizations early on. Wet sounds. Clicking.",25,14
1q122f4,,"Occasionally something that almost resembled speech, but not in any language I knew. I convinced myself it was random neural firing. I should not have.",25,15
1q122f4,,"The encounter happened during a scheduled overnight integrity check. Just me and Lena, another researcher, running diagnostics on the containment systems after a pressure fluctuation alert.",26,16
1q122f4,,"The mold was sensitive to electromagnetic interference, and a storm was passing through. At 02:17, Echo-9 sat up. I do not mean he strained against restraints or twitched.",28,17
1q122f4,,I mean he sat up like a healthy person waking from sleep. The straps did not snap.,17,18
1q122f4,,"They slid off him, slick with gray-black growth that had not been there an hour earlier. Lena froze.",18,19
1q122f4,,"I remember the hum of the machines getting louder, or maybe my hearing narrowed around it. Echo-9 tilted his head, joints cracking like old wood soaked in water.",28,20
1q122f4,,"Then he looked directly at me. Inside his eyes was movement. Not reflections. Not floaters. Something turning, slowly, like a spiral staircase sinking into darkness. He spoke.",27,21
1q122f4,,"“I know where you end,” he said. His voice came from too many places at once, layered, as if the sound was traveling through him instead of originating there.",29,22
1q122f4,,"Lena screamed. The lights went out. Emergency red flooded the room. The glass between us and the chamber fogged instantly, not from condensation but from growth.",26,23
1q122f4,,"Filaments spread across it in tight, deliberate coils, spelling nothing, but suggesting intent. Echo-9 pressed his hand to the glass.",20,24
1q122f4,,"Where his skin touched, the mold bloomed outward, pushing through microscopic flaws, tasting the air on our side.",18,25
1q122f4,,"I smelled wet soil and rot and something metallic, like blood on a battery. The intercom crackled to life. Not with security. With breathing. Echo-9 smiled.",26,26
1q122f4,,"His mouth opened wider than it should have, and I couldn’t look long enough to understand how. “You already carry us,” he said.",23,27
1q122f4,,"“We only need you to notice.”

Lena ran. I did not blame her. The hallway lights strobed as alarms finally caught up with reality.",24,28
1q122f4,,I stayed because I saw something on my tablet. The neural scans were still running. The mold was not just reacting to Echo-9’s brain. It was syncing with ours.,29,29
1q122f4,,Patterns on the screen matched my own baseline readings from earlier that week. Stress markers. Memory recall spikes. The Helix Strain was not infecting the body first.,27,30
1q122f4,,It was mapping the mind. The containment protocols finally engaged. Automated foam. Ultraviolet floods. Chemical fire.,16,31
1q122f4,,"I watched Echo-9 slump as the mold calcified, locking him into a statue of blackened flesh and hardened growth. Before his eyes went opaque, he mouthed one last thing.",29,32
1q122f4,,"“Thank you.”

Officially, the incident was contained. The wing was sealed. Echo-9 was declared terminated. The Helix Strain was logged as neutralized. I was granted indefinite medical leave.",28,33
1q122f4,,"If you are reading this and you have seen mold that grows like it is thinking, do not touch it. Do not clean it.",24,34
1q122f4,,Do not look at it too long. It is not spreading the way you think.,15,35

1q0wk4v,,"I jumped a little, as a nearby shoe store suddenly slammed its doors down with a mighty crash which echoed through the mall’s seemingly deserted twists and turns.",28,55
1q0wk4v,,"I quickened my pace. I was starting to feel trapped, and it was making me very uncomfortable.",17,56
1q0wk4v,,I couldn’t shake this sudden feeling that I might somehow get stuck in here.,14,57
1q0wk4v,,"Finally, after what felt like forever traipsing through these dimly lit halls, I found the Target, an oasis of bright lights among these quickly darkening passageways.",26,58
1q0wk4v,,"I made my way inside and ran through to the kids section. It was literally a couple of minutes until close now, so I didn’t waste time tossing up options.",30,59
1q0wk4v,,"I grabbed a few books that looked like they might be interesting to kids, and picked up a little princess toy set on my way back to the front of the store.",32,60
1q0wk4v,,"Hearing the sounds of yet more roller doors squeaking their way down, I headed straight for the checkouts.",18,61
1q0wk4v,,"I walked a little faster now, as the lights in the store began shutting off one by one.",18,62
1q0wk4v,,"It gave me that weird feeling again, it made me feel so very small, like a mouse trying to make his way out of a maze.",26,63
1q0wk4v,,What was particularly odd is the place really did feel like it was deserted.,14,64
1q0wk4v,,"There were a few other people here and there, but nothing like the crowds I had anticipated.",17,65
1q0wk4v,,"Every so often I’d catch sight of a fellow shopper, darting their way between the aisles. So I wasn’t the only one here, but still, it felt like I was.",30,66
1q0wk4v,,"*BOOM…*

A dull electrical impact from above me, as another of the store’s overhead fluorescent lights shut off behind me.",20,67
1q0wk4v,,"*BOOM…*

And another, I was practically running to the checkouts now, sweat forming on my face. Something wasn’t right. *BOOM…*

Darkness.",21,68
1q0wk4v,,"I was standing in absolute darkness, entirely alone… in the middle of a Target store in the busiest shopping centre in Brisbane City. No way, this was wrong.",28,69
1q0wk4v,,"This was very, very wrong.",5,70
1q0wk4v,,"As if reading my mind, I heard a crackle coming out of the tiny speakers in the ceiling above me, as a soft spoken, cheery voice came across the store’s intercom system.",32,71
1q0wk4v,,"*“Good evening shoppers, the store is now closed. We hope you have had a wonderful shopping experience with us tonight.",20,72
1q0wk4v,,"Please bring any remaining purchases to the checkouts so we may complete your transactions. We pray you get home safely”.*

Okay… that was odd.",24,73
1q0wk4v,,"Well, the entire situation was odd, but “pray you get home safely”? It almost sounded threatening. Anyway, I was done with this. Absolutely and totally done.",26,74
1q0wk4v,,"I made my way to the checkouts area, which were also now in complete darkness, save for a tiny flickering blue light above.",23,75
1q0wk4v,,"They really don’t mess around come closing time. I approached the one remaining open checkout, a small self serve unit, and began scanning my items.",25,76
1q0wk4v,,"*Beep…*

The sound seemed to echo through the looming halls outside. *Beep…*

I glanced up, looking down the gaping maw that awaited me. I had this feeling I couldn’t shake.",30,77
1q0wk4v,,"Like something might crawl out of there, trying to get me. *Beep…*

Around a corner, the faint rattle of a door came rolling around through the darkness.",27,78
1q0wk4v,,"*Beep…*

My anxiety was heightening with every beep that rang out. I couldn’t take this anymore! *Beep! Beep! Beep! Beep! Beep!*

The checkout started making an absolute racket!",28,79
1q0wk4v,,"Oh screw this, I am out!",6,80
1q0wk4v,,"I grabbed the rest of my stuff, pulled a $50 note out of my pocket and threw it onto the checkout, leaving one of the books to keep it weighted down.",31,81
1q0wk4v,,"I wasn’t sticking around any longer. I shoved my things into a bag and got the hell out of there, breaking into a swift power walk toward the exit.",29,82
1q0wk4v,,"As I walked, one quick step at a time, the ominous ambience of a dead shopping mall in the silence of the night emanated around me.",26,83
1q0wk4v,,"Distant footsteps, faint buzzing from the remaining dull lights. Every so often I’d hear some voices in the distance, shouting or laughing, the sounds bouncing their way around the centre.",30,84
1q0wk4v,,"After a minute or two of this, I finally caught sight of the exit, and broke into a jogging pace straight for it.",23,85
1q0wk4v,,"That feeling of fresh air on my skin, is one of the best sensations I have ever felt.",18,86
1q0wk4v,,"As I clanged my way down the now deactivated escalator, I swore to myself that this was the last time I was ever going to chance shopping at night.",29,87
1q0wk4v,,Something about what happened in there was not right at all.,11,88
1q0wk4v,,"Beyond just being creeped out about being stuck in the centre alone, it felt like something more, something I couldn’t place, but it touched on a primal part of my brain.",31,89
1q0wk4v,,"Anyway, I was out, and all was fine. I slowly strolled my way down the now devoid of life Queen Street Mall.",22,90
1q0wk4v,,"It’s like a fever dream in the early mornings or late hours, a stark contrast to what is usually a bustling tourist hot spot.",24,91
1q0wk4v,,"As I walked, I noted the sounds and the smells around me, no longer surrounded by the crushing emptiness of that damned shopping centre, but instead the peaceful ambience of the night.",32,92
1q0wk4v,,"I noted the calls of the many nocturnal animals that lived in the city’s parklands, the breeze whistling through the streets and alleyways, which felt nice on an otherwise warm summer’s night, and the soft lapping of the Brisbane River, a sound which could be heard blocks away when the city was quiet enough.",54,93
1q0wk4v,,"It was perhaps because of this calming atmosphere that I was not alarmed at first, when I looked up ahead and noticed that a few of the mall’s Christmas performers were still out and about.",35,94
1q0wk4v,,"They were merely sillouhettes at my distance from them, but I could make out a group of kids, and two or three of the stilt walkers still up and about doing their routines.",33,95
1q0wk4v,,"It gave me a chuckle at first, they were very committed to their bit!",14,96
1q0wk4v,,"However, it was when one of the stilt walkers broke away from the group, lumbering away from the others in a wide turning circle, before walking down towards me, that I decided to take an alternative route.",37,97
1q0wk4v,,"I get it’s fun for kids, or parents shopping with their children, but the whole “chasing” thing was not something I wanted to be dealing with at 10:30pm at night.",30,98
1q0wk4v,,"*Shuffle shuffle shuffle…*

The stilt walker continued her slow approach in my direction, as I made a swift left turn down an open laneway.",24,99
1q0wk4v,,I just wanted to get back to the hotel already. This night had been so… weird.,16,100
1q0wk4v,,"*Shuffle shuffle shuffle…*

The footsteps of the stilt walker continued behind me, as I heard her slapping her way past the small opening of the laneway, and disappearing beyond.",29,101
1q0wk4v,,"I was nearing the opening to Elizabeth Street when I heard it again. *Shuffle shuffle shuffle…*

From the other side this time. What the hell was she doing? And why?",30,102
1q0wk4v,,"This “joke” was going too far. I doubled back, making my way back toward the mall.",16,103
1q0wk4v,,"As I passed by a little ramen joint about halfway through the laneway, I noticed the owner was still there.",20,104
1q0wk4v,,"He was just standing there, staring out at me from behind the closed shutter.",14,105
1q0wk4v,,"There was a look in his eyes, similar to that homeless man I had encountered earlier in the night, almost manic, yet a hint of concern.",26,106
1q0wk4v,,"As soon as I caught his eyes, he turned away, disappearing into the back room.",15,107
1q0wk4v,,"I don’t know what it was, but that small exchange got my heart racing, and I began walking much faster toward the opening back to the mall.",27,108
1q0wk4v,,"I was nearing the exit, ready to emerge and literally run back to my hotel when…

*Shuffle shuffle shuffle…*

Again. Another one. Yes, more than one now.",27,109
1q0wk4v,,"One behind me, and one right in front of me. I turned back again.",14,110
1q0wk4v,,"I know, I know, it’s just a stilt walker you might say, I should have just run past her and gotten out of there if I was scared.",28,111
1q0wk4v,,"But that’s the thing, I ***was*** scared! I didn’t even know why at the time. I just didn’t want to go out there with that thing.",26,112
1q0wk4v,,"I made my way back through the laneway for a third time, stopping midway and pushing on a little white doorway, hoping it would take me elsewhere… anywhere…

*Shuffle shuffle shuffle…*

***In*** the laneway now, coming down toward me.",39,113
1q0wk4v,,"I pushed the door open and shoved my way inside, not caring exactly where this would lead.",17,114
1q0wk4v,,"As I entered into what I now saw was a narrow stairwell, I caught a glimpse in my peripheral of the stilt walker wobbling from side to side as she made her way slowly toward me.",36,115
1q0wk4v,,"“Why? Why can’t they just stop?”, I thought to myself.",10,116
1q0wk4v,,"I slammed the door, and began climbing up the stairwell, no idea where I was headed, but just happy that it was away from those things.",26,117
1q0wk4v,,"*Slap… slap… slap…*

A different sound now, equally as unsettling though.",11,118
1q0wk4v,,"I made my way to the top of the stairs and opened another door, one that lead into a small office style room.",23,119
1q0wk4v,,"The truth is I was equally nervous about who’s space I might be trespassing upon, but in the moment it just felt like the lesser of two dangers.",28,120
1q0wk4v,,"Feeling my way around the room in the darkness, carefully ensuring I didn’t trip over anything, I made my way to the far wall and took a peak out the small glass window.",33,121
1q0wk4v,,"I cracked it open a little, and poked my head out just enough to get a good look up and down Elizabeth Street. Nothing.",24,122
1q0wk4v,,"The streets were empty, just the distant hum of traffic elsewhere in the city, and the pitter patter of the rain that had been teasing me earlier in the night.",30,123
1q0wk4v,,"It smelled nice, and the calming sounds of little droplets hitting the pavement had me almost relaxed again.",18,124
1q0wk4v,,"*Slap… slap… slap slap slap… slap slap slap slap slap!*

That sound, this time much faster.",16,125
1q0wk4v,,"I pulled away from the window and I squeezed myself into a corner of the room, wedged between the side of a locker and the concrete wall it stood by.",30,126
1q0wk4v,,"I planned to wait it out. Honestly, even if I had to wait all night, I didn’t care. I wasn’t taking another step outside with those stilt walkers.",28,127
1q0wk4v,,"They were acting crazy now, and I had no idea why. It had gone far beyond a joke. So, I waited there, in the stillness of the night.",28,128
1q0wk4v,,"I stood there, for hours and hours, eventually sliding down the wall to sit, and letting my head rest against the steel locker beside me, drifting between that almost asleep state and back again, wondering how the hell my otherwise boring night had ended up here.",46,129
1q0wk4v,,"\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

It must have been the early hours of the morning when I was pulled from my sleepy state.",19,130
1q0wk4v,,"It took me a while to figure out what had disrupted me, and why I felt so uneasy as I drifted back into consciousness.",24,131
1q0wk4v,,"It’s a strange thing, the human mind, when confronted by fear it cannot comprehend, it will often try anything to reason the situation, or distract itself.",26,132
1q0wk4v,,The first thing I completely took notice of was the sounds.,11,133
1q0wk4v,,"The rain still gently fell outside, and I noted the drops trickling down the windows, pooling into little puddles at the base.",22,134
1q0wk4v,,I registered the sound of the wind picking up in strength as it blew back and forth down the dark and wet city streets.,24,135
1q0wk4v,,"Still in a sleepy daze, my grip loosened on the bag I was holding, the one containing the little princess play set, and the sound of the many components clattered across the floor startling me into full consciousness.",38,136
1q0wk4v,,"I suppose it was not until that very moment that I snapped into full awareness of my surroundings. It was staring right at me…

Just me… and it.",28,137
1q0wk4v,,"In this little room. Not 2 meters between each other’s faces. Outside… it was hunched. A lumbering form bent over, disappearing into the darkness below.",25,138
1q0wk4v,,"Its stretched neck was sliding part way in through the glass window I had opened earlier, to the point that its head was now partly inside with me.",28,139
1q0wk4v,,These were not stilt walkers.,5,140
1q0wk4v,,"Here I sat, at least 3 storeys up, in total silence, as this thing silently stared at me, its neck swaying back and forth in the wind outside, causing subtle squeaking sounds on the glass.",35,141
1q0wk4v,,"I tried to close my eyes, but I could not keep them closed.",13,142
1q0wk4v,,Every second that my eyes were shut I would imagine this thing sliding its neck further in through the window.,20,143
1q0wk4v,,"*Squeak… squueeeeaaaakkkkk…*

The glass groaned, as its filthy neck slid back and forth against it.",15,144
1q0wk4v,,"I began to slide my way across the floor, very slowly, trying to make my way to the door.",19,145
1q0wk4v,,"The problem was, the massive office desk sat between me and the door, with a hardwood divider right behind it.",20,146
1q0wk4v,,"I would need to move closer to the window in order to make my way out. *Slide… drag… slide… drag…*

Inch by inch.",23,147
1q0wk4v,,"With every subtle movement I made, its eyes stayed locked on me, and it released these awful, deep laughing sounds.",20,148
1q0wk4v,,"Not loud and booming like you may expect, but rather quiet. Almost like a child’s laughter, if you recorded it and pitched it down a few semitones.",27,149
1q0wk4v,,"With every slide toward the door, I came a little closer to the window… closer to it.",17,150
1q0wk4v,,"Its neck would spasm as I inched closer, like it was trying to reach its face just a little bit nearer to me.",23,151
1q0wk4v,,"*Slide… drag… squeak… squueeeeaaaakkkkk…*

At this point I felt like bursting into tears.",13,152
1q0wk4v,,"I was midway across the room now, in front of that huge office desk, and our faces were mere inches apart.",21,153
1q0wk4v,,"The glass squeaked louder now, as its neck slid back and forth against the thin barrier between us, with every brush, the glass began to groan a little more, threatening to crack.",32,154
1q0wk4v,,"*Slide… drag… squeak… squueeeeaaaakkkkk…*

I was less than half a meter away from the doorway, when the first visible crack started to appear in the glass window, as its neck shook and vibrated.",33,155
1q0wk4v,,"The rain continued to fall outside, and the wind continued to howl. The world, so peaceful, in a terrifying contrast to what was happening in front of me.",28,156
1q0wk4v,,"It laughed again, an almost silent little chuckle, as it snapped its head backwards, realising that the glass was giving out.",21,157
1q0wk4v,,"My hand reached the doorknob and turned it open just as the glass broke away, a stray shard piercing into that twisted neck with an audible squish.",27,158
1q0wk4v,,"Just as I opened the door and slipped through, slamming it shut behind me, I heard this thing begin to cry, almost as though it was sobbing and laughing simultaneously.",30,159
1q0wk4v,,"Again, childlike in nature, but deep and guttural.",8,160
1q0wk4v,,"As I made my way down the stairs, quickly, but being careful not to make more noise than I had to, I heard a strange brushing sound against the door behind me, like scratching, but damp and wet.",38,161
1q0wk4v,,"I shuddered, as I imagined a tongue stretching out from that awful mouth.",13,162
1q0wk4v,,"This time, I did not hesitate, emerging from that alleyway I ran out into the dark, rainy streets. There was no relief in my flight.",25,163
1q0wk4v,,With every step the image of something massive following close behind me was present in my mind.,17,164
1q0wk4v,,"I was acutely aware that at any moment an all too large hand may clasp around me, raising me to my demise.",22,165
1q0wk4v,,"And of course, the sounds were there to confirm my fears. *Slap! Slap! Slap! Slap! Slap!*

The distant sound of something barefoot running through the mall. After me?",28,166
1q0wk4v,,"I did not know. Nor was I going to chance looking to find out. I quickly made my way back to my hotel, taking every shortcut I was aware of.",30,167
1q0wk4v,,"Arriving at the front lobby I slammed my card against the reader and flew in through the doors, grabbing the first elevator up to the 12th floor I was staying on, where I hoped beyond hope that I would be safe.",41,168
1q0wk4v,,"I admit my haste was selfish, should I have warned the staff at the front desk? Maybe. I guess I’ll never know if I made the right choice.",28,169
1q0wk4v,,Who in their right mind would believe the ramblings of a man who had just witnessed what I had?,19,170
1q0wk4v,,"The elevator dinged at my floor, and I ran to the assumed safety of my room. Swiftly, I made my way to the window and flung open the curtains.",29,171
1q0wk4v,,"I suppose this is the point in these stories where, typically, one might neatly close things out by explaining that nothing of interest could be seen, that I didn’t know if it was imagined or real, and never will.",39,172
1q0wk4v,,"How I wish I could sit here and tell you this. For what I saw was very real, and no doubt will forever remain in my mind.",27,173
1q0wk4v,,"There were many of them. Tall, impossible things, lumbering up and down the mall, and the streets and laneways beyond. They appeared just as the thing I had encountered did.",30,174
1q0wk4v,,"Almost innocent in their nature, even childish. I sat there and watched them all night.",15,175
1q0wk4v,,"As the hours crept towards 5am or so, and daylight began to crawl across the streets of Brisbane City, I watched in horror, as these things began to shrink.",29,176
1q0wk4v,,"What had been giants, suddenly were a fraction of their size, yet still, quite tall. Maybe… 10 feet if I had to guess. It fell into place then.",28,177
1q0wk4v,,"The stilt walkers. Performers they were not. Or, they were by day at least, I mean… That’s what they were masquerading as.",22,178
1q0wk4v,,"But I knew now those were not their true forms, not their true faces. As night fell, they became something else.",21,179
1q0wk4v,,"I thought back to the many times I had seen these things chasing people, chasing kids through the mall.",19,180
1q0wk4v,,"I thought back to earlier in the night, when I first caught sight of these things, there had been many children around them. Were they kids who had been captured?",30,181
1q0wk4v,,"Spirited away? I dare not think of it. There are still things I don’t understand, and many questions I’ll never have answers to.",23,182
1q0wk4v,,"But the realities here remain, and you would do well to heed my warnings. STAY AWAY FROM QUEEN STREET MALL AFTER DARK!!!",22,183
1q0wk4v,,"In fact, just to be safe, the minute you hear those shops rolling down their doors at closing time, LEAVE! Get yourself back home.",24,184
1q0wk4v,,"Get on a bus, I don’t care where it’s headed. Just get as far away from that damned place as you can.",22,185
1q0wk4v,,"You don’t want to find yourself alone in those desolate, abandoned streets… when The Talls come [out...](",17,186
1q0vbht,Something Evil is Seeping into Fernsmouth,I was surprised to see her back in the building.,10,0
1q0vbht,,"She had kept her head down in the pews, but now in the confession booth, her breaths came out in choked sobs. The sound sent goosebumps up my arms.",29,1
1q0vbht,,"“Heather what is it?” I asked, my voice hushed even though it was only us left in the building. Hiccupping she took several breaths. “Father, I am so sorry.",29,2
1q0vbht,,"I’ve done something terrible.” she shudders, the movement is jerky and awkward. “Tell me then Heather, you can trust me.",20,3
1q0vbht,,"Does Larry know anything about this?” Peering through the screen she nods. “It was him that did it. I watched it happen, oh god Father.",25,4
1q0vbht,,"They’re watching everywhere, but not here for some reason.” I didn’t have any clue what she was talking about.",19,5
1q0vbht,,"This was the first I had heard of her husband in some time, the first I had seen her in some time. ""Where is your husband?” I asked.",28,6
1q0vbht,,"“I haven’t seen him in three months, I thought you had disappeared along with him.” I hadn’t laid eyes on Heather in well over a month.",26,7
1q0vbht,,"“They took him, and then they took me Father.” she inhales again, sitting up a little straighter. “That therapy group he joined, they’re beyond demented.",25,8
1q0vbht,,"The missing people, it's because of them.”

“Amity ?",9,9
1q0vbht,,"The therapy group?” I had lost some of my congregation to them, a self help group that offered alternatives my church could not.",23,10
1q0vbht,,"Friendly competition at most, a different path to peace. Heather jerked her head up and down.",16,11
1q0vbht,,"“People who go there get sucked into their group, some get taken from their homes.” I shuddered at the mention of the missing family.",24,12
1q0vbht,,They had left one depressed girl in their wake. I had been brought in to talk to her at the station.,21,13
1q0vbht,,"What the officers thought I could do, I was most unsure. The only response I had gotten from the girl had been a muttered thanks. I couldn't blame her.",29,14
1q0vbht,,"Who wanted some preacher in their ear after something like that? “Heather, have you gone to the police about this?",20,15
1q0vbht,,"What sort of proof do you have?” She only started sobbing again. “It was Larry oh god, he was so confused.” she started hyperventilating at this point.",27,16
1q0vbht,,"Rushing out of the booth I swung open her door, and let her pile into my arms.",17,17
1q0vbht,,"“Breath, Heather please just breathe, you can tell me here, you know that.” She clung to me with hands of iron, skinny fingers digging into my arms with all the ferocity of a tiger.",34,18
1q0vbht,,"“Larry killed Dave , and we all just watched.” Her eyes shot wide open, looking into mine with a fear that made me pale. “You watched?” I asked.",28,19

1q0vbht,,"“We need to go to the station right now, and tell the officers!”

“No!” she screamed and pulled away from me, darting to the altar, curling around it like a scared cat.",32,21

1q0vbht,,"I’ve been hiding like a rat for a week now, and all I know is that they won’t come here, they avoid the church no matter what.” She fell down to her knees, hands locked together.",36,23
1q0vbht,,"“Please, I beg you. Just listen to me Father. I don’t know what else to do.” Her hands ran through her hair.",22,24
1q0vbht,,"“God they’re getting bigger by the day.” Letting out a breath I indulged her. Her story was insane, and disjointed. Everything about it told me the woman’s mind had broken.",30,25
1q0vbht,,"Her story claimed that Amity Aims was a cult making people disappear. Everybody was in on it, members of the police force, some members of the town council.",28,26
1q0vbht,,"I did what I could to comfort the lady. “Breathe Heather, is there anywhere I can take you?” I asked. She shook her head rapidly.",25,27
1q0vbht,,She seemed adamant about the murder her husband had committed. “No please just hide me here for a while Father.,20,28

1q0vbht,,"I’ll grab you some supplies, so you can hide for a time.” 

“Thank you, thank you, thank you.” she said bowing at my feet.",24,30
1q0vbht,,"I reassured her one more time, ignoring my pity for the woman. A terrible thing to do as a preacher, but her story was unhinged.",25,31
1q0vbht,,The grief of her missing husband had driven her over the edge. Something becoming more common as the missing persons count grew higher.,23,32
1q0vbht,,"The station wasn’t far from the church, and the interior was warm, the smell of black coffee wafting in the room.",21,33
1q0vbht,,"The lady behind looked tired, her blond hair done up in a tight bun. She smiled brightly as I walked towards the desk.",23,34
1q0vbht,,"“Father Owen, how can I help you today?” She ran a finger over a silver ring.",16,35
1q0vbht,,"“Hello Leslie, this is a lot to dump on you, but Heather the missing woman just showed up at the church out of the blue.” Leslie raised an eyebrow. “Really?",30,36
1q0vbht,,"She’s been missing for awhile now, what did she say to you?” I relayed the story, watching her brows raise higher and higher as it went on.",27,37
1q0vbht,,She leaned back when I finished furrowing her brow. “The chief will want to know about this. He’ll probably want to go with you.,24,38
1q0vbht,,Wait here please Father.” I sat down in one of the uncomfortable chairs in the lobby and tapped my feet. I felt like a schoolboy waiting for the principal.,29,39
1q0vbht,,"The chief came into the lobby with another officer, Desmond, a local of the town. “Hello Father.” The chief was a kind man. Silver haired, with a well groomed mustache.",30,40
1q0vbht,,"“I hear you’ve found a missing person, for me.” I smiled. “I wish I could take the credit sir, but she came to mass today.",25,41
1q0vbht,,"She needs help.” He nodded grimly. “So I’ve heard, Desmond and I will follow you back to the church, and take her in.",23,42
1q0vbht,,Good chance she’ll know where the other missing people are.” he motioned to the door.,15,43
1q0vbht,,"“After you Father.”

The door to the church creaked open, Heather was nowhere to be found. I turned back to Chief Greg.",22,44
1q0vbht,,“There’s a good chance she’ll be down near the kitchen. There’s a spare bed down there.” I stopped again.,19,45
1q0vbht,,"“She’s also very on edge, I’ll go down first just to calm her.” The men nodded, as I pushed a door open into a small hallway.",26,46
1q0vbht,,"The kitchen was small, the stove light on, a bed not far from it just barely visible in the pale yellow light. “Heather?” I called warily.",26,47
1q0vbht,,"My footsteps creaked on the floor. Hands grabbed me as I stepped further into the room, something sharp was against my throat. “You got the police.” she hissed.",28,48
1q0vbht,,"She pressed the knife further into my skin. “Of course Heather, please just let go of the knife.",18,49
1q0vbht,,"They’re here to help.”

“Did you see their hands?” Heather’s words jabbed into my ears, her breath hot.",18,50
1q0vbht,,"“Heather please, what are you talking about?” I squirmed in her grip, only causing her to hold me tighter.",19,51
1q0vbht,,"“You have to look at their hands they have a-” 

“Hands now!” The two officers had their guns pointed at Heather, eyes locked onto the woman.",26,52
1q0vbht,,"Using the distraction I pushed from her grasp, as Desmond rushed in and tackled her, ripping the knife from her hand. She screamed, flailing and crying as he cuffed her.",30,53
1q0vbht,,She screamed all the way as they drug her out into the daylight towards the muddy police vehicle. The logo covered with a layer of brown filth.,27,54
1q0vbht,,"“You killed me Father, you killed me!” she howled like a banshee, some onlookers watching with horrified expressions. The two men wrestled her into the car, slamming the door.",29,55
1q0vbht,,Her cries were muffled. Greg let out a sigh. “You alright Father?” he asked. My hands shook at my sides.,20,56
1q0vbht,,"I could feel a light scratch where the knife had dug into my throat. I took a deep breath clasping my neck. “I will, thank you gentlemen.",27,57
1q0vbht,,I’m just glad I was able to help. Have a blessed day.” Greg looked at me with skepticism in his eyes.,21,58
1q0vbht,,"“You need anything else Owen you know where to find us, hell you know where to find me.",18,59
1q0vbht,,"You need a free meal or something, come on over.” I assured him once more. The drive back to my home passed in a daze.",25,60
1q0vbht,,"Only when I pulled into my driveway, did I wake up. Three dogs had knocked over my trash can and were digging through it.",24,61
1q0vbht,,"They were skinny and mangy, their unclean fur reached my nostrils as I stepped out. “Beat it!” I yelled at them. They froze heads snapping up.",26,62
1q0vbht,,"Their eyes were wide mouths agape with sharp yellow teeth. One snarled, and I leapt back a hand on my throat. What was I thinking?",25,63
1q0vbht,,"They could maul me if they wanted to. Instead they barked loudly before tearing off into the neighbourhood. Grumbling, I stuffed my garbage back and wearily stepped into my home.",30,64
1q0vbht,,"The tv hummed away, I couldn’t even remember what I had thrown on. I felt restless, as Heather's words rang in my head. Guilt made my insides boil.",28,65
1q0vbht,,"Though I didn’t know why. Praying had offered little consolation. If the lord was listening, he offered no signs. I shut off the tv, the silence deafening.",27,66
1q0vbht,,"Every creak of the house seemed so much louder than it had before. My clock ticked and tocked, an unceasing marching beat.",22,67
1q0vbht,,"The sound was just audible enough that I had to stop several times, to make sure it was real. It was coming from my backyard.",25,68
1q0vbht,,"Slowly I crept towards my backdoor, the glass window fogged up from the night air.",15,69
1q0vbht,,"I tried in vain to look through it, but I could just barely make out the shapes in my backyard.",20,70
1q0vbht,,"The blurry forms of my garden beds, and a table I had left out were just visible.",17,71
1q0vbht,,"The sound was wet, occasionally a snap would accompany the sound of something being torn. Slipping on my shoes, I grew bold and opened the backdoor.",26,72
1q0vbht,,"Yellow light flooded the backyard, showing nothing. The sound stopped. From where I stood, I could see over the fence that hemmed in my yard.",25,73
1q0vbht,,Three sets of glowing eyes peered back at me. The shapes were lithe just visible in the dark. They started growling.,21,74
1q0vbht,,"I leapt back looking at what must have been the three dogs from earlier, or coyotes. I had no idea of knowing.",22,75
1q0vbht,,"I opened my mouth to yell at them, when a fourth shape rose from the dark. It moved slowly in a fluid motion, its eyes glowing in the dark.",29,76
1q0vbht,,"Then it moved forward. A long pale hand with sharp yellow nails, rested on the top of my fence. The fingers were covered in a dark red.",27,77
1q0vbht,,Some tiny voice in my head told me it was blood.,11,78
1q0vbht,,"The light shone on the torso of the figure, revealing the ends of snow white hair, and a long slender neck. The jaw of the figure was matted in blood.",30,79
1q0vbht,,"The dogs began barking, yapping in a loud frenzy. The figure raised another blood covered hand in a wave. The lips began moving a hissing sound coming from them.",29,80
1q0vbht,,Like they were trying to talk. I didn’t wait to listen.,11,81
1q0vbht,,"I slammed the door shut, watching as the figure leapt over the fence and started walking straight towards the backdoor.",20,82
1q0vbht,,"I screamed and burst out of my front door, into the cold night. Something slammed behind me, glass broke.",19,83
1q0vbht,,"My keys were still in the house, so I sprinted down the sidewalk, screaming the entire way.",17,84
1q0vbht,,"I could hear the figure behind me, footsteps getting closer, the dogs growling and yapping.",15,85
1q0vbht,,"The red house was near the corner of the street, and I leapt up the stairs and banged on the door with all my might.",25,86
1q0vbht,,"It swung open revealing a disheveled Chief Greg in a bathrobe, with his gun in hand. “Owen what the hell?” he shouted.",22,87
1q0vbht,,"“Look out!” The growling dogs behind me stood at the steps snapping maws covered in blood. “Get out of here you mutts, get out!” he bellowed.",26,88
1q0vbht,,The dogs sprinted into the dark. “What’s going on?” Owen turned to me. “There was someone outside my house!,19,89
1q0vbht,,They were with those dogs.” I whirled behind me scanning the darkness for any movement. The figure had vanished.,19,90
1q0vbht,,"It didn’t take long for police to surround my house, the blue and red lights dancing in the night sky. Greg stood with two other officers behind the fence.",29,91
1q0vbht,,"They had scanned the house, the only sign of an intruder was my backdoor that had been kicked open. The figure hadn’t left any other signs of entry.",28,92
1q0vbht,,"No footprints, or anything. The only thing they had found was a dead deer.",14,93
1q0vbht,,The body mangled and torn into the stomach nothing but a hollow cave of rib bone and flesh. “We’ll get this cleaned up for you Father.,26,94
1q0vbht,,"Are you sure you saw somebody?” he peered into my eyes. “Yes Greg, I’ll never forget what she looked like.” I sat down, hands on my knees.",27,95
1q0vbht,,I would never get to sleep tonight. Greg set a hand on my shoulder.,14,96
1q0vbht,,"“Alright then, we’ll keep an eye on your house for a few times Owen, best I can do.” He waved a hand around the house.",25,97
1q0vbht,,“We’ll even set you up with some security alarms to help you feel safe again. Just try to sleep tonight.” He gave me one last concerned look before leaving.,29,98
1q0vbht,,"I stayed awake the entire night. Even though I knew it was a mistake, I left my house. Some men came by early to install my security alarms.",28,99
1q0vbht,,One of them had a silver ring on. Heather’s warning echoed in my mind. The hands. People in the grocery store were wearing them.,24,100
1q0vbht,,"Seemingly only a few at first, but the number grew. I counted five at least. The cashier waved at me and told me to have a good day.",28,101
1q0vbht,,"Her ring glinting in the sun. Three more people wore them. I drove straight back to my house, she had been right the entire time.",25,102
1q0vbht,,"The alarms were installed on my house, a guide was tucked underneath my welcome mat. They were easy to turn on, seemingly normal. I knew better than to trust these.",30,103
1q0vbht,,Both of those men might have also had rings as well. Did this mean some sort of group had invaded the town? What was their goal?,26,104
1q0vbht,,I closed my blinds and rooted through my house like a rat. I found two cameras.,16,105
1q0vbht,,"Small bug eyed things, one on my tv sensor, and one concealed behind some books in my room. They had already invaded my home.",24,106
1q0vbht,,"Time passed in a slow crawl, as I jolted at every sound. I didn’t even know if I could trust my neighbours.",22,107
1q0vbht,,Lord I had turned Heather right over into their hands. She was as good as dead for all I knew. The police force was compromised to an extent.,28,108
1q0vbht,,"If only I had looked at their hands, the only one so far was Leslie.",15,109
1q0vbht,,"But what about Greg himself, or Desmond, or the other officer that had shown up last night? The sun sank beneath the horizon and the shadows crept back in.",29,110
1q0vbht,,I looked through my window blinds and saw a police car parked out front. I only hoped I could trust them.,21,111
1q0vbht,,"How easy would it be for them to walk in and shoot me? I didn’t aim to find out, and tried to keep myself up through the night again.",29,112
1q0vbht,,"Slowly yet surely the exhaustion began to take me. The creaking awoke me first. His massive frame filled my view, the only thing visible in the dark. “Father,” he said.",30,113
1q0vbht,,"“Larry?” I mumbled. The punch knocked me onto the floor, something in my face cracked. The taste of iron filled my mouth, as a tooth fell out of my mouth.",30,114
1q0vbht,,"I tried to drag myself across the floor, but a large hand grabbed me by the back of my neck, and threw me into my kitchen.",26,115
1q0vbht,,"“This is my next step, Father, so I get better. My mistress will watch.” The words make no sense, I don’t have time to process them.",26,116
1q0vbht,,"This man is a killer. Before I can get back up, a foot slams into my chest, and I feel a rib crack.",23,117
1q0vbht,,"Wheezing I swipe at the man, but my hits do nothing. His massive hands wrap around my throat.",18,118
1q0vbht,,"He lifts me like a doll, and spots and stars dance in my vision as the breath leaves my chest.",20,119
1q0vbht,,"“Witness mistress, witness please.”

The man lifts me above the kitchen sink, and my eyes lock onto the pale figure again.",21,120
1q0vbht,,The woman smiles with glee as the moonlight shows her manic expression as the life is squeezed from me.,19,121
1q0vbht,,"My hand fumbles in the dark, as everything dims, latching onto the handle of the knife, I bring it up in an arc.",23,122
1q0vbht,,"The blade plunges into Larry’s shoulder, and he bellows like a beast from Hell. He stumbles back into the counter smashing his head into a cupboard.",26,123
1q0vbht,,"Scrambling I bolt for the door, slamming into my kitchen table, and spiraling into my couch. The brute recovers quickly, grabbing me by my right arm.",26,124
1q0vbht,,"He forces me to the ground, and before I can register what he’s doing, a massive weight slams down onto my elbow. Bone cracks and pain explodes in my arm.",30,125
1q0vbht,,"I know I screamed, but somehow the pain drowns it out. The only thing I can hear is a dull ringing in my ears.",24,126
1q0vbht,,"Larry roars again, lunging down at me. The front door bursts open.",12,127
1q0vbht,,"I watch Larry look up in confusion at the light from outside, displaying a feral looking man, his shoulder a deep dark red.",23,128
1q0vbht,,"The next moment his fleshy throat explodes into pulp, his left eye explodes, as a part of his skull goes with it.",22,129
1q0vbht,,"Greg rushes over me, his words ringing as he tries to say something to me, but oblivion takes me.",19,130
1q0vbht,,"My arm is shattered making it rather difficult to type all of this. Larry almost killed me, a man I considered a friend.",23,131
1q0vbht,,"I’m grateful Greg was there to save me. I’m in the hospital right now, some of the staff are wearing silver rings. I can’t be here for much longer.",29,132
1q0vbht,,"Something evil has seeped into my town, and I need to find out what.",14,133
1q0t66v,I keep finding scabs on my body that I don’t remember getting,"I’m exhausted, but I can’t just not tell anybody about this. And since I’m not talking with my folks, you guys will just have to do.",26,0
1q0t66v,,"I’ll start from the top—when I first realized something wasn’t right. It was Saturday, around two a.m. I couldn’t sleep.",20,1
1q0t66v,,"I stood in front of the bathroom mirror, pulling at the loose, dark skin that forms the bags under my eyes, and that’s when I saw another red, rust-colored scab on my lower eyelid.",34,2
1q0t66v,,"Either this rash is weakening my skin to the point where it’s tearing, or I’m scratching myself bloody in my sleep.",21,3
1q0t66v,,"I looked down at my left hand, the place where it all started.",13,4
1q0t66v,,"You’d think I’d put it between two feral cats having it out, judging by all the small red, crusty spots and lines running up from my knuckles to my shoulder.",30,5
1q0t66v,,"It’s been two weeks, and the rash has only gotten worse.",11,6
1q0t66v,,"I’ve tried everything—chamomile lotion, aloe vera, hot water, cold water, even this weird suggestion I got from a buddy online about banana peels, though I think he was just pulling my exceedingly desperate leg.",34,7
1q0t66v,,"I went to my doctor, and they said I must be having an allergic reaction to something. But what? I haven’t changed a thing.",24,8
1q0t66v,,"Same old laundry detergent, same old body wash, even the same old scratchy bedsheets.",14,9
1q0t66v,,"They set me up with an appointment with a specialist, but it’ll take a month to get in.",18,10
1q0t66v,,"I tried a few other doctors, and at this point I’ve had so many doses of Benadryl forced into me that I’m surprised I haven’t overdosed.",26,11
1q0t66v,,"Thankfully, I’ve got some sick days and vacation time saved up to wait this out until my dermatologist appointment. My boss nearly fainted when she saw me.",27,12
1q0t66v,,"Can’t exactly serve food with a smile while looking like a rashy leper. Between the itching and the medication, my head’s swimming.",22,13
1q0t66v,,"I’m so out of it that I keep remembering scabs that aren’t there, or I’ll go to scratch a spot only to find a massive scab I swear wasn’t there an hour ago—like they’re moving when I’m not looking.",39,14
1q0t66v,,"I leaned on the bathroom sink, pulling my eyelid down to get a better look at the scab. A nasty thing—small, but gnarly-looking, brownish red, like an old water-soaked wound.",30,15
1q0t66v,,"There was even a hair poking out of it, which was strange, because as far as I knew, hairs don’t grow on eyelids.",23,16
1q0t66v,,"It must’ve gotten stuck during the healing process. A loose eyelash, maybe. Still, it bothered me.",16,17
1q0t66v,,It was bad enough looking like some kind of burn victim—now this thing was just sitting there. Mocking me.,19,18
1q0t66v,,"I know you’re not supposed to pick at scabs, but I couldn’t help myself. I slid my finger up and rubbed at the small black line—

and OW! Jesus Christ!",30,19
1q0t66v,,"Okay. Not a hair. It was stiff, and whatever it was felt attached deep. When I poked it, the entire scab shifted. This was going to hurt.",27,20
1q0t66v,,I knew I shouldn’t pick. But just staring at that black line was unbearable. I just had to be careful. Slow and delicate.,23,21
1q0t66v,,"After all, a foreign object in a healing wound couldn’t be good, right?",13,22
1q0t66v,,"I grabbed a pair of tweezers, some rubbing alcohol, and a bandage to deal with the inevitable blood.",18,23
1q0t66v,,"Slowly… slowly, I reached out with the tweezers and tried to grip the tip of the black line, but it kept slipping free—like it had a mind of its own.",30,24
1q0t66v,,"Finally, on the fourth attempt, my patience wore thin. I grabbed it at the base, clamped down, and yanked.",19,25
1q0t66v,,"It came free along with the scab and a small trickle of blood. I dropped the tweezers and cupped the bleeding spot under my eye, cursing myself.",27,26
1q0t66v,,"I splashed alcohol on the wound, hissing at the burn, then slapped a bandage over it. When I turned back to the sink to grab the tweezers, I froze.",29,27
1q0t66v,,My scab was twitching. I stared in horror as I realized the black line wasn’t a hair. It was a leg. One of many.,24,28
1q0t66v,,"I stood there, watching the little legs kick as the scab—which I now realized wasn’t a scab at all but some grotesque little beetle latched to my skin—flailed, trying to right itself.",32,29
1q0t66v,,Maybe it was the medicine. My head wasn’t right. It had to be some bug I just hadn’t noticed. I flipped it over with the tweezers.,26,30
1q0t66v,,"Its underside—no, what made up its back—was a rusty brownish-red shell that looked exactly like a scab.",17,31
1q0t66v,,"The moment it landed on its legs, it took off, scrambling uselessly against the ceramic sink. I turned on the faucet and washed it down the drain.",27,32
1q0t66v,,"I stood there shaking, skin crawling.",6,33
1q0t66v,,I’d mistaken some giant bed bug for a scab on my eye—and it had latched on so tightly it hadn’t even moved when I woke.,25,34
1q0t66v,,"That’s what bed bugs do, right? They’re supposed to be sneaky. Maybe that explained the rash. The realization made my stomach turn. I had to check my bed.",28,35
1q0t66v,,"I walked from the bathroom to my cheap mattress, scratching my arm as I went. I flipped it. Nothing. I stripped the sheets, the pillowcases. No shells. No stains.",29,36
1q0t66v,,They had to be coming from somewhere. I got down on my hands and knees and checked the wooden frame. That’s when I saw it.,25,37
1q0t66v,,"Another red bug, lying on its back beside a dust bunny. I scooped it up with my slipper to get a closer look. It was bigger than the first.",29,38
1q0t66v,,"Its shell was lumpy, edged in white. That same rusty reddish-brown. It looked exactly like a scab. Not camouflage. Not resemblance. Exact. No. No no no no no—oh God, no.",30,39
1q0t66v,,The thought finally clicked. I looked down at my arms. Scabs lined them. Under my arms. On my hands. My elbows. Rusty reddish-brown.,23,40
1q0t66v,,"And on one or two—

Thin black lines. Moving. I scratched. I couldn’t help it. The sensation, the sight—knowing they were all over me.",24,41
1q0t66v,,"I raked my nails down my arm and felt something rip free. One fell onto its back, flailing. Another vanished into some crevice. I kept scratching.",26,42
1q0t66v,,"Pain burned through me, but the sight of a third barely hanging on sent me into a frenzy. Scabs and blood dropped to the floor.",25,43
1q0t66v,,"Some ran when they hit the ground. Others bolted toward my feet, trying to crawl up my legs. I stomped and jerked around, half-hysterical.",24,44
1q0t66v,,"When one made it into my shirt, I tore the stained thing off. I couldn’t tell where it went. Every scab felt like it was moving.",26,45
1q0t66v,,"I slapped and rubbed at my skin until I stumbled back into the bathroom, desperate for the mirror.",18,46
1q0t66v,,"I grabbed the alcohol, tore the cap off, and dumped it across my stomach. The burn was immediate. Wounds bubbled. Two of the things fell free, writhing on the tile.",30,47
1q0t66v,,"After that, everything blurred. The 911 operator must’ve thought I was insane. Who would believe me? But when the police arrived and saw me, they labeled my apartment hazardous immediately.",30,48
1q0t66v,,I don’t know what happened to my neighbors. I don’t know if they evacuated the building. They brought me to some kind of medical facility. Chemical wash. Observation.,28,49
1q0t66v,,They grabbed my phone and charger on the way out. Thank God. I overheard one of the staff mention Dermestus scabiformis while they were taking notes.,26,50
1q0t66v,,So I guess this isn’t their first rodeo. It’s been two days and I guess i'm healing well. The wounds have scabbed over again.,24,51
1q0t66v,,They keep telling me not to pick. But… wouldn’t you?,10,52
1q0slqs,I Left Blood in a Cave That Isn’t on Any Map,I’m typing this with my left thumb because my other hand is wrapped so thick it looks like a winter mitten.,21,0
1q0slqs,,"If you’ve ever crawled into a cave you shouldn’t have, you already know the first lie you tell yourself is that you’re doing it “safely.”

We weren’t.",27,1
1q0slqs,,We were just careful enough to feel responsible. Helmets. Two headlamps each.,12,2
1q0slqs,,Mine was a Black Diamond Spot that still had the price sticker on the battery door because I’m lazy.,19,3
1q0slqs,,"Each of us had a tiny backup light in a pocket, a cheap rope, and a first aid kit the size of a paperback that made us feel grown-up.",29,4
1q0slqs,,It was my idea. That part matters. We heard about the cave the usual way.,15,5
1q0slqs,,"Somebody’s cousin knew somebody who “used to go in there all the time.” The location was given to us like a dare, not like directions.",25,6
1q0slqs,,"A pull-off with no sign, a thin trail that looked like deer made it, and then a hole in limestone you could miss if you weren’t looking for it.",29,7
1q0slqs,,No gate. No posted signs. Nothing that said keep out. We told ourselves that meant it was fine.,18,8
1q0slqs,,We parked in a gravel patch that had room for maybe two cars.,13,9
1q0slqs,,The kind of place where the weeds are taller than your bumper and there’s always a crushed soda can and a beer bottle in the brush. No trailhead map.,29,10
1q0slqs,,No register box. Just trees and quiet.,7,11
1q0slqs,,We did the thing where you stand at the entrance and kill your lights for a minute so your eyes stop fighting the dark. That’s when we heard it. Breathing.,30,12
1q0slqs,,"Not a drip. Not water moving. Not a bat flutter. It sounded like someone breathing through their nose, slow and calm, like they were asleep just inside the rock.",29,13
1q0slqs,,"My friend clicked his light on and swept the entrance. The beam caught wet stone and pale dust and nothing else. “Air moving,” he whispered, like the cave cared.",29,14
1q0slqs,,I nodded because I wanted it to be air. We turned our lights off again and listened. The breathing stopped. That should’ve been enough.,24,15
1q0slqs,,"Instead, I laughed, the dumb kind of laugh you do when you’re trying to make your body unclench, and I said, “Okay. Weird.",23,16
1q0slqs,,"Let’s go.”

The cave swallowed light in a way that didn’t feel normal. It wasn’t just dark.",17,17
1q0slqs,,"It felt absorbent, like your beam hit the walls and didn’t bounce back the way it should. The entrance narrowed fast.",21,18
1q0slqs,,"We ducked, then crouched, then moved in that half-walk, half-squat that makes your thighs burn.",15,19
1q0slqs,,The floor shifted from gritty rock to mud that grabbed your boots and made little sucking sounds every time you lifted your feet.,23,20
1q0slqs,,"After a while, the air stopped smelling like outside. No leaves, no cold breeze, no anything. Just stone and damp.",20,21
1q0slqs,,We dropped through a squeeze into a wider chamber and stood up like we’d earned it.,16,22
1q0slqs,,"It was big enough to stand in comfortably, with a dark passage on the far side that looked like a throat. That’s where the smell hit us.",27,23
1q0slqs,,"Not “cave smell.” Not damp mineral. This was sweet and sour at the same time, like old meat left in a freezer after the power goes out.",27,24
1q0slqs,,It stuck to the back of my tongue. It made me swallow even though swallowing didn’t help. My friend covered his nose with his sleeve.,25,25
1q0slqs,,"“I don’t like that.”

I didn’t answer right away because I was listening. Every cave has a rhythm. Drips. Distant water. Little ticks.",23,26
1q0slqs,,A low constant background that keeps you from noticing how quiet it really is. This chamber had none of that.,20,27
1q0slqs,,"Then, from somewhere in that far passage, we heard a soft scrape. Not loud. Not sudden. Just the sound of something being pulled across rock.",25,28
1q0slqs,,I snapped my light toward the passage. The beam shook because my hand was already starting to tremble. Nothing. Just stone. The scrape happened again. Closer this time.,28,29
1q0slqs,,"Low to the ground. My friend took a step back and his boot skidded in the mud. “Turn around.”

We had a rule.",23,30
1q0slqs,,"If either of us says “turn around,” we turn around. No arguing. No ego.",14,31
1q0slqs,,"I broke the rule by taking one stupid step toward the far passage, like getting closer would turn fear into curiosity. The scrape stopped. Silence pressed in.",27,32
1q0slqs,,Then came a small wet click. Like a tongue against teeth. Like someone trying to imitate a sound they’d heard a human make. My friend didn’t whisper this time.,29,33
1q0slqs,,"“We’re leaving.”

We turned. The squeeze we’d come through looked different from this side. That happens underground.",17,34
1q0slqs,,"Your brain files the shape away wrong, then hands it back to you like a bad memory. My friend went first because he’s smaller.",24,35
1q0slqs,,"I followed, flattening myself into the gap. Helmet scraping stone. Breath loud in my own ears. My headlamp beam jittering across rock inches from my face.",26,36
1q0slqs,,"We were halfway through when something touched my ankle. Not a brush. Not a bump. A grip. Cold. Dry. Pressure like fingers, but too long. Too many points of contact.",30,37
1q0slqs,,I kicked hard. My boot hit something that felt like knotted cord stretched over bone. The grip tightened.,18,38
1q0slqs,,I yelled my friend’s name and the sound ricocheted off the cave walls until it turned into pure panic noise. My friend’s boots scuffed faster ahead of me.,28,39
1q0slqs,,"“GO,” he shouted. “GO GO.”

The thing on my leg yanked. I slid backward an inch. In a squeeze that tight, an inch is a mile.",26,40
1q0slqs,,"I twisted and kicked again. The grip slid higher, past my boot, against my calf, and I felt a sharp sting, then warmth. It was cutting me.",27,41
1q0slqs,,"Not with a blade. With something rough and hard, dragging across skin. One of my hands came free. I reached back blindly, grabbing at whatever had me.",27,42
1q0slqs,,"My fingers hit hair. Thin hair, wet with cave moisture, stuck to something that felt like skin stretched too tight.",20,43
1q0slqs,,I jerked my hand away and it came back with a few pale strands stuck to my glove. Panic hit like a switch flipping.,24,44
1q0slqs,,I surged forward with everything I had. Helmet banging rock hard enough to spark my vision. Shoulders scraping. Hips catching. Ribs grinding against stone.,24,45
1q0slqs,,"The grip slipped, caught, then tore away.",7,46
1q0slqs,,"When I burst out of the squeeze, I slammed onto my hands and knees in the mud and sucked air like it was my first breath.",26,47
1q0slqs,,"My friend grabbed the strap of my pack and yanked me upright. “Don’t look,” he said. I looked anyway. My headlamp beam swung back to the squeeze. At first, nothing.",30,48
1q0slqs,,"Then something pressed into the gap from inside, not coming out, just pushing forward like it was testing the space. Pale, not white, more like the color of old fat.",30,49
1q0slqs,,"The surface looked wet but didn’t drip. A mouth, too wide, packed with small teeth. Not predator teeth. More like someone crammed too many human teeth into one place.",29,50
1q0slqs,,No eyes that I could see. Just smooth skin catching the edge of my light.,15,51
1q0slqs,,It made that wet click again and breathed in through something that might have been a nose. The same breathing we’d heard at the entrance.,25,52
1q0slqs,,My friend yanked me away so hard my neck snapped back. We ran. My leg throbbed and every step sent a bright pulse up my calf.,26,53
1q0slqs,,"Warm wetness soaked my sock. Behind us, the scrape followed, sometimes close, sometimes far, never gone. We hit another low squeeze and dropped to our bellies.",26,54
1q0slqs,,The scrape behind us changed. Faster. A shuffle. Like it had decided. Something hit the back of my boot. Then my injured calf.,23,55
1q0slqs,,"The texture came through my pants: hard ridges under thin skin. It didn’t feel like muscle. It felt like something that shouldn’t bend, bending anyway.",25,56
1q0slqs,,I kicked back on instinct and my heel landed against something that felt like a jaw. It clamped. Not a deep bite. A hold.,24,57
1q0slqs,,"Teeth pressing through fabric into skin, enough to flash my vision white. I screamed. Ugly, honest noise.",17,58
1q0slqs,,"My friend reached back, grabbed my wrist, and pulled like he was trying to rip me out of the cave by force. Stone scraped my ribs. My helmet snagged.",29,59
1q0slqs,,My bad leg flared and I tasted metal in my mouth.,11,60
1q0slqs,,"Then my boot tore free with a wet rip and I slid forward, dragging my leg through the narrow space while something behind me clicked and scraped at rock like it was frustrated.",33,61
1q0slqs,,"We burst out into a sloping tunnel that led toward the entrance chamber. Fresher air hit my face in faint cold waves, the best thing I’ve ever felt.",28,62
1q0slqs,,"We didn’t stop until we hit the first chamber, the one with old graffiti and muddy footprints from other people who’d turned around where we didn’t.",26,63
1q0slqs,,"The gray smear of daylight was visible ahead. For one second, I thought it was over. Then the breathing started again, louder now, and it had something extra in it.",30,64
1q0slqs,,"A faint tremor, like excitement. My friend kept a hand on my pack and pushed me forward.",17,65
1q0slqs,,We hit the mouth of the cave and spilled into the trees and the normal world.,16,66
1q0slqs,,I fell onto leaves and dirt and lay there gulping air that suddenly felt too thin.,16,67
1q0slqs,,"My friend stood a few feet away, staring at the entrance like he expected it to follow us. I stared too. The darkness inside didn’t move.",26,68
1q0slqs,,"But right at the edge where stone met daylight, something shifted. Just enough for us to know it was there.",20,69
1q0slqs,,"A pale curve, the suggestion of a head leaning forward, testing light. And then, from just inside the mouth, it made a sound that was almost a word.",28,70
1q0slqs,,"My friend’s voice, but flattened and wrong, like someone wearing it. “Leaving.”

My friend grabbed my arm and hauled me up. We half-walked, half-staggered back to the car.",28,71
1q0slqs,,I don’t remember the trees. I remember the way my own breathing sounded too loud.,15,72
1q0slqs,,"At the gravel pull-off, my friend sat me on the bumper and peeled my pant leg up.",17,73
1q0slqs,,"Three long cuts ran down my calf where it had grabbed me first, like I’d been raked by rough stone.",20,74
1q0slqs,,"Below that, a crescent of shallow punctures where it had clamped. Too many. Too evenly spaced. Not like any animal bite I’ve seen.",23,75
1q0slqs,,"He poured water from a plastic bottle over the cuts. The water ran pink, then bright red, then clear again. We drove in silence.",24,76
1q0slqs,,I told a version of the truth later under fluorescent lights. I said I slipped in a tight spot. I said my leg hit rock.,25,77
1q0slqs,,I said it was my fault. The nurse didn’t look impressed.,11,78
1q0slqs,,"She cleaned the wounds, asked if my tetanus shot was up to date, and said, “You’re lucky it wasn’t worse,” in the same tone you’d use for someone who burned their hand on a stove.",35,79
1q0slqs,,They stitched what needed stitches. Wrapped what needed wrapping. Sent me home with instructions that had nothing to do with caves. I tried to be normal about it. I showered.,30,80
1q0slqs,,I threw my clothes into the washer on hot. I scrubbed the mud out of my boots with an old toothbrush until the bristles bent.,25,81
1q0slqs,,"When I cleaned the tread, I found a thin strand of pale hair stuck in the grooves. Almost clear. Like fishing line until you held it to light.",28,82
1q0slqs,,"It wasn’t mine. It wasn’t my friend’s. I flushed it because I didn’t want it in my house. Last night, I woke up at 2:13 a.m. because I heard something.",30,83
1q0slqs,,"Not footsteps. Not a voice. Not a movie sound through a wall. Breathing. Slow and calm, through a nose, coming from somewhere in the dark part of my home.",29,84
1q0slqs,,"I held my breath and listened, waiting for it to stop the way it did at the cave entrance. It didn’t stop.",22,85
1q0slqs,,"It kept going, steady and quiet, like it was trying to match my rhythm. I tried to be rational. Houses make noise. Vents breathe. Pipes tick.",26,86
1q0slqs,,Brains do weird things when they’ve been scared. Then I heard a small wet click. It could have been anything. The heater. A settling sound.,25,87
1q0slqs,,"My imagination snapping to a familiar pattern. But I didn’t move for a long time. This morning, I found my boot by the door where I left it to dry.",30,88
1q0slqs,,The toothbrush I’d used was sitting inside it. I do not remember putting it there.,15,89
1q0slqs,,"That’s the only tangible thing I have, other than stitches and scars, and it’s almost nothing. It’s not proof. It’s just wrong.",22,90
1q0slqs,,"If you’re the kind of person who thinks you can go underground and come back out unchanged, don’t.",18,91
1q0slqs,,"Because I’m sitting here with my leg wrapped, trying to convince myself I’m safe, and I keep catching myself going quiet in my own home, like silence is a trick that might keep me alive.",35,92
1q0slqs,,And the worst part is I’m not sure anymore if the cave followed us. Or if it only learned us well enough to live in my head.,27,93
1q0phvs,Does Anyone Know How to Delete an Instagram Account?,I don't know if that will make her leave me the hell alone but I've gotta try something.,18,0
1q0phvs,,"Last night, I was scrolling through the list of available home health aides in my local area.",17,1
1q0phvs,,Not the most engaging way to spend the last moments of your weekend but it had to get done.,19,2
1q0phvs,,I hate to admit it but Mom and especially Dad have wilted in their retirement years. A fall here and a forgotten name there snowballed into lasting issues.,28,3
1q0phvs,,"Eventually I decided to move back into my childhood home and my childhood bedroom to look after them. They deserved it after all for having been such great, supportive parents.",30,4
1q0phvs,,"Mom, the old free-loving flower child and Dad, the former cop.",11,5
1q0phvs,,They were really quite the odd couple but to me they were simply the best parents a kid could ask for.,21,6
1q0phvs,,Their days of dropping acid and arresting baddies were long gone though and father time was catching up to them by the moment.,23,7
1q0phvs,,"Shortly after I'd moved back home to live with them, I’d realized that even all of my precious few after work hours that I could dedicate to their care weren’t going to be enough.",34,8
1q0phvs,,"Before I let it slip my mind, I set up an in person interview for Tuesday with a nicely dressed woman that we could just barely afford.",27,9
1q0phvs,,No sooner had I finished before I was doomscrolling under the covers in bed on ig instead of sleeping. You know how it goes.,24,10
1q0phvs,,"An hour slipped by followed by another. Before I knew it, I was 4 hours deep into the binge.",19,11
1q0phvs,,"I was watching shorts like a zombie or some sort of living, breathing AI.",14,12
1q0phvs,,I had never been a big believer in putting the phone down and just closing my eyes.,17,13
1q0phvs,,"At some point after 3am, I woke up to the gentle kiss of my phone wrecking me in the face. I must have fallen asleep for just a moment.",29,14
1q0phvs,,I had been comfortably curled up in bed upside down with my head where my feet should be.,18,15
1q0phvs,,"My comforter was splayed out with half of it on me, half on the floor. And of course I’d held my phone gingerly, dangling ominously above my head.",28,16
1q0phvs,,"Through the pain of a burgeoning fat lip and broken pride, I realized my phone was blaring the sound of an Instagram short.",23,17
1q0phvs,,"Over some stock twinkly melody, that same weirdly cheery female ai voice repeated: 

“Day 5 of sharing my practical and fashionable mom outfits”

The video must have been all of 5 seconds long.",33,18
1q0phvs,,"As I laid with the back of my neck draped over the edge of my bed, my hands blindly felt around the cluttered bedside floor.",25,19
1q0phvs,,I twisted my blanket about in a lazy attempt at a desperate search for my phone. The assault on my ears continued as the line repeated.,26,20
1q0phvs,,"“Day 5 of sharing my practical and fashionable mom outfits!”

By the 9th time I heard it, I felt that I'd begun to lose my mind.",26,21
1q0phvs,,"And by the 15th time, I was in perfect sync with it.",12,22
1q0phvs,,"As I sloughed off my bed and onto the floor, I sang out, “Day 5 of sharing my practical and fashionable mom outfits!” while doing my best sarcastic face.",29,23
1q0phvs,,I tossed shit around aimlessly and fumbled around on my floor in the darkness. Hope for a fast recovery was draining by the moment.,24,24
1q0phvs,,I realized my phone must have taken one of those funny jumps. Not funny haha. Funny sad. One of those jumps where it was probably deep under my childhood bed.,30,25
1q0phvs,,"I craned my neck to see and sure enough, there was my phone in the dead center of the hazy dark beneath the bed.",24,26
1q0phvs,,"It glowed in the darkness, mocking me. By that moment, I think I had really personalized this conflict.",18,27
1q0phvs,,The phone had not only battered my innocent face but now also sought to psychologically torture me with the psychotically cheery “Day 5 of sharing my practical AND fashionable mom outfits!,31,28
1q0phvs,,Teehee!” I’d had enough.,4,29
1q0phvs,,"Like a badass, I jammed my shoulder against my bedframe, stretched my fingers to their absolute maximum and pulled my phone back from the jaws of hell.",27,30
1q0phvs,,That's when I saw her for the first time. My very first thought was that she looked like a bitch.,20,31
1q0phvs,,"That wasn't fair though but it sure as hell was how I felt. Really she was just a fairly plain white woman, maybe late 40s, early 50s.",27,32
1q0phvs,,She had long brown hair that looked dry and thin. She sort of danced? Well she tried to do something with her body anyways.,24,33
1q0phvs,,"She began with her head turned away, leading into a cheesy over the shoulder glance. What a flirt. Turning, she stared unblinkingly at the camera.",25,34
1q0phvs,,"She clumsily swayed her wide hips back and forth while modeling a sleeveless tan sweater, tight corduroy pants, and the charming dead eyes of a fish.",26,35
1q0phvs,,"With her wrists held out on either side of her, she sort of resembled a belly dancer, just the sort of flabby, tired one you'd hire from Craigslist.",28,36
1q0phvs,,"As she looped her stilted little mom jig to the relentless sound of the AI voiceover, her ever present sallow grin began to incense me.",25,37
1q0phvs,,"I'm not proud of what I did next. In retrospect, I’ll say that I really wish I hadn't been so petty. “DAY 5 OF BEING A STUPID OLD BITCH!!!",29,38
1q0phvs,,"#ozempic,” I typed. I wish that's where I'd stopped. Mean comments just kept coming to me in a flurry as I furiously swept through her page.",26,39
1q0phvs,,"I threw out “Day 6 of sharing my saggy old anteater tits on Ig!!!”

The accompanying video was her showing off her mom bod in a one piece by a pool.",31,40
1q0phvs,,“Day 69 of sharing my shitty AND stupid tips on getting the driest hair in the trailer park!” was my take on her latest upload before something caught my eye.,30,41
1q0phvs,,In her gallery was a photo that stood out. It looked to be her from years ago.,17,42
1q0phvs,,She was standing in a field with who I presumed to be her son. He was a soldier by the looks of him. He stood partially dressed in uniform.,29,43
1q0phvs,,His cap was too small. I mean it was comically too small for his massive head.,16,44
1q0phvs,,He saluted the camera with his man boobs puffed out while his mom wrapped her arm around his waist.,19,45
1q0phvs,,It occurred to me that even he looked pained to be next to his mother.,15,46
1q0phvs,,"I quickly patted on my keyboard, “ i MiSs mY dEaD gAy sOn 😭😇,” put my phone on do not disturb and went to sleep.",25,47
1q0phvs,,I awoke to my work alarm and before I could even silence it my phone was exploding with notifications.,19,48
1q0phvs,,Dozens and dozens of comments and mentions from instagram rolled in too fast to read.,15,49
1q0phvs,,"As I swiped up to the homescreen, the latest notification from ig was in full view.",16,50
1q0phvs,,"“elanarosa4197 - homegurl do look like a freak but this nasty omfg”

My heart skipped a beat.",17,51
1q0phvs,,I double tapped the comment and when it opened I felt like I might faint. There I was. Except it couldn’t be me.,23,52
1q0phvs,,The image in the post was a mugshot of me looking disheveled with red puffy eyes and running eyeliner like I’d been crying hard.,24,53
1q0phvs,,Obviously someone had photoshopped me into the image but it looked official. It had the typical cookie cutter layout of a mugshot from my county’s sherrif’s department.,27,54
1q0phvs,,It even got my height and weight and my fucking date of birth correct.,14,55
1q0phvs,,"According to the mugshot, I’d been charged with: 

Unlawful Sexual Contact

Elder Abuse

Aggravated Stalking

Making Terroristic Threats

I felt physically ill as I scrolled past numerous reposts of the fake mugshot, trying to trace back where it all started.",40,56
1q0phvs,,It had been posted by so many randoms but not just them.,12,57
1q0phvs,,"I was on mugshawtys, dumb criminals doing dumb things, and all other manner of pages that post mugshots for content already.",21,58
1q0phvs,,Worst of all there was even an honest to god patch article for my local area. I was seething with anger and felt like I was living out some nightmare.,30,59
1q0phvs,,I replied to messages at light speed. Even my own actual friends were dming me asking if I’d really been arrested.,21,60
1q0phvs,,"I very nearly shit myself when I saw a dm from my coworker, Isla, asking if I’d seen the mugshot.",20,61
1q0phvs,,"“Peter from biz dev ops sent me the link this morning… girl r u good?”

“Fuck!!” I screamed. I threw my phone.",22,62
1q0phvs,,"Just as it smacked the wall, the ringer went off. I scrambled to pick it back up. Incoming call from Work. “H-hello?”

“Hi, this is Marina from Exzelt.",28,63
1q0phvs,,"Am I speaking with Sarah?”

I struggled to put on my work voice. “Uh, yeah!",15,64
1q0phvs,,"Hey, Marina,” I said as cheerfully as I could manage, “how’s it going, girl?”

“Sarah, hey…so HR has gotten a few reports this morning that relate to you.",28,65
1q0phvs,,"Is it possible for you to come in a little early so we can have a pre-shift chat regarding some of our concerns?”

Hot tears were welling up in my eyes as I assured Marina in the most positive, innocent sounding voice that I could muster that I’d be there asap.",51,66
1q0phvs,,"As we hung up, a wave of anger crashed over me. Who the fuck did this to me!?",18,67
1q0phvs,,"I went back onto ig and scrolled back as far as I could, going from repost to repost looking for the origin of the photoshopped mugshot. There it was.",29,68
1q0phvs,,"There she was. @SophyStartingOver

The crispy haired, practical AND fashionable old witch that I sorta went off on last night.",20,69
1q0phvs,,"She’d posted the mugshot to her page and written, “some people are just so sick #sad.” She’d @’d more instagram pages than I could count.",25,70
1q0phvs,,“What the fuck is your problem you stupid fcuking asshole??,10,71
1q0phvs,,What are you trying to do to me!?” I fired off the message as I slung my leg into my work pants.,22,72
1q0phvs,,"Just as I was closing the app and tossing my phone onto the bed, I saw a reply.",18,73
1q0phvs,,"“ ; ) “

I didn’t have time to think about this crazy woman.",14,74
1q0phvs,,"I never left myself enough time to get to work by 8 and now I needed to be there fifteen minutes early so I could explain to HR that no, I hadn’t fondled a grandma or whatever.",37,75
1q0phvs,,"I threw on a scarf and hustled downstairs. “Mom, Dad I've got to go! Have to get to work early for a meeting! Love you!” I called.",27,76
1q0phvs,,"“Have a nice day, sweetheart,” my elderly mother called from the kitchen. “Don't work too hard now, princess” my father added from his worn out recliner.",26,77
1q0phvs,,I kissed my dad on the top of his head as I went careening by his chair towards the door.,20,78
1q0phvs,,"“I won't!”

As I walked out the front door and onto the stoop, I paused for a moment to check my phone.",22,79
1q0phvs,,It was just after 7 as I stepped out onto the muddy winter streets. My job was only a block up and a couple over but the sidewalks were treacherous.,30,80
1q0phvs,,"They’d iced over in the aftermath of the snow pounding we’d taken over the weekend. Like a woman possessed, I hopped over patches and speedwalked where I could.",28,81
1q0phvs,,"As I crossed the little bridge before my last turn, a streak of black ice took me out.",18,82
1q0phvs,,My legs came out from under me and I flew ass up before landing hard on my back. I cried out. I screamed.,23,83
1q0phvs,,Not because I was in a lot of pain. I mean I was in a lot of pain but this was just the last straw.,25,84
1q0phvs,,"The stupid starting over lady on Instagram pranking me, my job, and now a bruised tailbone was the icing on the cake. The stress of it all was too much.",30,85
1q0phvs,,"I enjoyed a few moments more of primal yelling, dusted myself off, and kept going.",15,86
1q0phvs,,"To make it all worse, I could hear some asshole laughing at me in the distance as I gathered myself together.",21,87
1q0phvs,,"I hurried inside when I got to the office, trying to hide my face from the gaze of my coworkers.",20,88
1q0phvs,,"They peeked over top of their cubicles to see if they could get a good look at me, the undercover grandpa molesting stalker and part-time terrorist.",26,89
1q0phvs,,I slung my purse across the chair at my desk and hurried to the meeting room.,16,90
1q0phvs,,"As I got closer, I could already see through the floor to ceiling glass panels that Marina and 2 of her HR colleagues were watching something on the large monitor on the opposite wall.",34,91
1q0phvs,,"One of them, a lanky guy that I wasn’t familiar with, waved his hands in an animated way.",18,92
1q0phvs,,"The other, Craig, the head people officer at our branch, tried to calm the lanky man down as Marina held her head in hand.",24,93
1q0phvs,,I accidentally made eye contact with all 3 as I rounded the corner.,13,94
1q0phvs,,"And just as I reached for the door handle, the animated guy pushed past me roughly as I tried to enter, practically shoulder checking me.",25,95
1q0phvs,,"Before I could sit down and say good morning, Marina began.",11,96
1q0phvs,,"“Sarah, as you know, we here at Exzelt believe the sanctity of all life extends to all living beings, not just humans.",22,97
1q0phvs,,"Actions that compromise that standard—even in an employee’s personal capacity—can create serious ethical misalignment and reputational risk for the company.”

“Wait, what?!”

Craig interjected, “right, and to operationally contextualize what Marina’s saying, the misalignment indicators we’re observing in your conduct trajectory intersect directly with our core value stream.”

“What?",49,98
1q0phvs,,"Can you…what are we talking about? The mugshot?!”

“The cat,” Marina exhaled looking down at the table. “It’s about the cat video from your instagram.”

“What cat video?",28,99
1q0phvs,,"From my account? I don’t have a cat! There is no cat? So there can’t be a cat video! I honestly don’t know what this is about, Marina.",28,100
1q0phvs,,"You’ve gotta believe -”

“Is this you?,” Craig asked as he stood next to the monitor pointing at it with the remote in hand.",24,101
1q0phvs,,On the screen was a photo of me standing outside my parent’s home. It looked like the photo was taken from across the street maybe 45 minutes earlier.,28,102
1q0phvs,,"How was that possible? “Yeah, that’s me but where did you even get -”

Craig pressed play.",17,103
1q0phvs,,"As the video began, the video version of me was standing just at the bottom of the walkup to my parents house.",22,104
1q0phvs,,It appeared I was looking down at my phone. She was wearing the exact outfit that I was still wearing down to the shitty green scarf my aunt had knitted.,30,105
1q0phvs,,"As the video continued, an adorable orange cat approached and nuzzled up against my ankles. Suddenly… I kicked it. I mean it wasn’t me.",24,106
1q0phvs,,But the girl that looked like me in the video kicked the cat hard. It made me flinch as I watched.,21,107
1q0phvs,,The kick sent the cat skidding into the metal post at the bottom of the stairs.,16,108
1q0phvs,,The poor little thing howled in pain and anger as it ran away as fast as it could. I was floored. “No.,22,109
1q0phvs,,"But that’s not -”

Craig interrupted, “I want to pause you right there, Sarah—because you just explicitly identified yourself as the woman in the video.",25,110
1q0phvs,,"And at this time, that admission provides all the operational clarity we need, okay?",14,111

“New gal? What do you mean?”

“From the service. Oh, the in-home caregiver. You know!",29,124

1q0m9la,,"He was the only reason I'd joined the fire department to begin with; before him I’d been an aimless soul, kicking between school and a house full of fading childhood memories with an apathy that would have ended me if I’d let it.",43,1
1q0m9la,,Meeting Frankie changed it all for me.,7,2
1q0m9la,,"Neither of us had the best start in life: my parents had died of cancer one after the other, leaving me to be raised by my grandma from the age of six, and Frankie’s mother and father were meth addicts that routinely abandoned him and his little brother to fend for themselves as though they’d forgotten they had children to begin with.",62,3
1q0m9la,,"Frankie wasn’t the sort of kid you’d leave in charge of your dependents, either.",14,4
1q0m9la,,"He was skinny and angry, full of an intense energy that scared the shit out of his teachers and kept the peers that might have bullied him well out of his way, and out of mine too purely through my association with him.",43,5
1q0m9la,,"In spite of this Frankie’s brother Caleb looked up to him, and I did, too, because no matter how wild he was Frankie always seemed to be doing something, whether it was an amateur money-making scheme or working out a way to sneak us into places we shouldn’t have been and wouldn’t have dared go on our own.",58,6
1q0m9la,,Old warehouses. The backrooms of clubs and bars. School after dark.,11,7
1q0m9la,,"As if by some weird magic we never got caught; Frankie seemed to know how to get out of anything or anywhere, talking so fast he could avoid trouble as much by bewildering the listener than reasoning with them.",39,8
1q0m9la,,Then as he got older and calmed down a little Frankie announced he wanted to use that knack he had to help people instead.,24,9
1q0m9la,,"It was like listening to a hero declare his manifesto: I was immediately in, signing up to the fire service with him practically that same day.",26,10

1q0m9la,,"An electrical fire, according to the report, that started small and had gotten out of control.",16,18
1q0m9la,,"I didn’t believe it at first, couldn’t understand how Frankie—who could do anything, and was totally fearless—had apparently frozen up and forgotten his training, ending up killed just like any regular civilian.",32,19
1q0m9la,,"But I had to go to his and Jenny’s funerals, see the closed coffins and the sickened faces of their relatives, and had to accept that I wasn’t getting Frankie back, and neither was the little brother he’d left behind.",40,20
1q0m9la,,"I felt for Caleb, for although I’d lost my best friend I still had my grandmother and my work, but the kid had nothing, barely able to afford the house he was living in.",34,21
1q0m9la,,"I remember how pathetic he looked, walking bent over through the graveyard, gripping his stomach through his cheap shirt like he was nursing a hernia.",25,22
1q0m9la,,He wasn’t crying— I don’t think he’d shed so much as a tear even during the service.,17,23

1q0m9la,,It was deeper than that. Bleaker than that.,8,46

1q0m9la,,"Frankie would never answer when I called his name or asked why he was there, though I was positive he heard me, his grin formed by a twist of flame, the black eyes seeming to narrow in recognition.",38,57
1q0m9la,,"Soon I began to dread seeing him. I withdrew into myself, didn’t talk more than I had to.",18,58
1q0m9la,,"The boys at the station must have noticed, but being that they all knew how badly losing Frankie tore me up none of them said anything about it.",28,59
1q0m9la,,"None, that is, but Darrell, who’d been at my side since the funeral, trying as hard as he could to be a friend to me even when I made it obvious I didn’t care for one.",36,60
1q0m9la,,"He checked in with me after every shift, hovering around as I prepared to leave, nearly falling down with stress and exhaustion. “I’m fine, D,” I’d say.",27,61
1q0m9la,,"“Get off my back, alright?”

He wouldn’t. If anything he started watching me even more closely, having picked up on something fearful behind my defensive tone.",26,62
1q0m9la,,Darrell was with me the day I saw Frankie for the last time.,13,63
1q0m9la,,"A knocked over candle had set an old house alight, causing parts of it to fall in on the young family sleeping there.",23,64
1q0m9la,,"Once we got in we discovered the three dead children almost instantly, their mother lying crushed under a broken ceiling beam, still just about conscious enough to call for help.",30,65
1q0m9la,,My partner and I went to her immediately to assess if we could safely remove the beam alone.,18,66
1q0m9la,,"As Darrell crouched down to talk to the woman I saw something shift in the flames eating at the perimeter of the room, something I’d seen so many times by then that I recognised it even before I turned around.",40,67
1q0m9la,,"Frankie was looking out through the fire, watching the woman on the floor behind me die.",16,68
1q0m9la,,"Suddenly I was unable to see anything but him, that awful face made of flame and the charred walls behind it encompassing my vision.",24,69
1q0m9la,,"My chest was pierced by the tight airlessness of panic, so overwhelming that I thought I might pass out if it lasted any longer.",24,70
1q0m9la,,It was Darrell shouting my name that broke me out of it.,12,71
1q0m9la,,"Glancing back over my shoulder I saw him staring at me through his visor, both hands gripping one end of the beam that had struck the woman down.",28,72
1q0m9la,,"Then Darrell's helmet swivelled abruptly, and I realised with a feverish pulse of my blood that he’d seen Frankie, too.",20,73
1q0m9la,,"“I need your help, man,” said Darrell, raising his voice to be heard through his apparatus.",16,74
1q0m9la,,"“Can you get over here?”

He hadn’t noticed that the woman under the beam was dead, her face turned on its neck so that she, too, seemed to be looking at the place Frankie had been.",36,75
1q0m9la,,Whether she'd seen him or not I’ll never know.,9,76
1q0m9la,,It was after the team and I returned to the station to debrief that Darrell lead me away from the others via a careful hand on my shoulder and sat me down out of earshot.,35,77
1q0m9la,,"“You saw him,” he said. “Frankie. You’ve been seeing him for months.",12,78
1q0m9la,,"Am I right?”

I didn’t bother denying it, just nodded and took a gulp of the bottle of water I’d been carrying around the station as much for the comfort of holding something as out of thirst.",37,79
1q0m9la,,"Darrell was silent for almost a minute, picking at dirt in the rim of one fingernail. “You told anybody about it?” he asked at last. “Just my grandma,” I answered.",30,80
1q0m9la,,“But she’s sort of a hippie type. She goes crazy for this kind of thing.,15,81
1q0m9la,,"She just came out with some shit about how maybe Frankie’s leading me to the dead, or comforting them when they leave the world or whatever.",26,82
1q0m9la,,"Or that maybe he’s just letting me know he’s still around.”

In a cautiously neutral tone Darrell said, “You don’t think she could be right?”

I barked out a laugh.",30,83
1q0m9la,,"“Nah. It felt wrong, seeing him. Dark. But I don’t know. It’s insane, right?”

Darrell nodded. “You gonna tell Caleb about this?”

“Nope.",23,84
1q0m9la,,"He’ll probably think I’ve lost my fucking mind.”

Grunting, Darrell got up and walked a stiff lap around the room.",20,85
1q0m9la,,"He’d strained something in his right leg, and he cringed with every step, one eye nearly closed in a Popeye squint.",21,86
1q0m9la,,"“If it was my brother I’d want to know,” he said. “Might help. I heard Caleb’s not doing too great. You should go over and see him.",27,87
1q0m9la,,"Could help you, too.”

Harshly I said, “I don’t need it.”

Darrell’s squinting eye widened. “Man, I’ve been watching you like a damn hawk since all this started.",28,88
1q0m9la,,"You’re messed up. You need to talk all this over with somebody.”

Emptying the last of the water bottle I dropped its empty carcass on the floor.",27,89
1q0m9la,,"“What about you?” I asked. “You saw Frankie, too.",9,90
1q0m9la,,"Maybe you ought to talk to somebody.”

With a gentle patience Darrell picked up the bottle and threw it into a nearby trashcan.",23,91
1q0m9la,,“I didn’t know Frankie the way you did. It didn’t hit me the same. But all those dead people we couldn’t save. That’s what gets to me.,27,92
1q0m9la,,"Gets me all the time.”

I realised, then, how selfish I’d been, so locked up in my own grief that I’d forgotten we were all part of it, all forced to keep on keeping on even as it bled like a bad wound.",43,93
1q0m9la,,"“Yeah, I know,” I said quietly.",6,94
1q0m9la,,"“It gets me, too.”



I went over to Caleb’s house that night with a pack of beers, wishing that I hadn’t left it for so long.",26,95
1q0m9la,,"Frankie had been dead for well over a year, and aside from the odd text message here and there I hadn’t kept in touch.",24,96
1q0m9la,,"Caleb and I had never been close; he’d tagged along on some of those childhood adventures with Frankie, but he’d always been an afterthought, a timid hanger on.",28,97
1q0m9la,,"Now when Caleb came to the door he looked worse than he had at the funeral, his hair in oily strings, an unwashed smell coming off him that was near thick enough to taste.",34,98
1q0m9la,,"His eyes moved from me to the cans as though considering turning me away, but without saying a word he let me in and collapsed into a stained couch, a shape like a snowman kicked down by kids, left to melt.",41,99
1q0m9la,,He hadn’t decorated for Christmas even though it was just around the corner.,13,100
1q0m9la,,I kept glancing at the empty space where Frankie used to put the tree with a sense of unease at another thing missing from our shared world.,27,101
1q0m9la,,"“You need help with anything, buddy?” I asked. “You know, if you’re having a hard time keeping up with everything...”

“I don’t need anything,” said Caleb.",26,102
1q0m9la,,"“Doing fine.”

He didn’t touch the beers, I noticed, just sat looking at the door as though waiting for me to leave. Likely hoping I would.",26,103
1q0m9la,,"“You don’t look so great, Cay,” I said. “You ought to come to a bar with me sometime.",18,104
1q0m9la,,"Get back into the swing of things.”

Caleb nodded, but didn’t say anything in reply. I plucked at the ring pull on one of the beer cans anxiously.",28,105
1q0m9la,,"“Cay,” I said. “It’s gonna sound nuts, but there’s something you need to know. It’s about Frankie.”

Hearing his brother’s name Caleb started in his seat.",26,106
1q0m9la,,"“What about him?”

“Sorry,” I said, wondering if it had been a mistake to come here while the death was still so fresh to him.",25,107
1q0m9la,,"“I know how it feels, losing him, is all. It fucked me up too. But listen, something’s been happening to me since then.",23,108
1q0m9la,,"You’re not gonna believe it, but I swear it’s the truth.”

Caleb’s hands began to twitch, and he pressed them between his knees to keep them still.",27,109
1q0m9la,,"“It’s about the fires,” he said. “Isn’t it?”

I stared at him, trying to figure out his expression in the relative dark of the room. “You already know?",28,110
1q0m9la,,"Who told you? Darrell? He swore he wouldn’t say anything till I came by. Look, I don’t want to sound crazy. Like I’m seeing things or whatever.",27,111
1q0m9la,,"But he saw it, both of us did.”

Caleb frowned. “Wait.",11,112
1q0m9la,,"What are you talking about, Drew?”

I cracked open a beer and got the story out as I drank, watching Caleb squeeze his hands together between his knees in mounting agitation.",31,113
1q0m9la,,"“So, anyway, it might not be a bad thing, you know?” I said, feeling stupid even as the words left my mouth.",22,114
1q0m9la,,"I wasn’t like my grandmother, with her spell jars and tarot decks. I didn’t really believe it. “Maybe he’s trying to help me with the work.",26,115
1q0m9la,,"Or could be he just wants us to know he’s still here or something.”

Caleb shook his head violently, the dirty ropes of hair thrashing his forehead. “Sure.",28,116
1q0m9la,,"He wants us to know. But it’s not a good thing. You get that, right?",15,117
1q0m9la,,"I fidgeted, trying not to acknowledge the awful tension that had entered that room, the same I felt in so many fires now.",23,118
1q0m9la,,"“There was something up between you two,” I said, “wasn’t there?”

“Not with us,” said Caleb flatly. “With Frankie. I tried to help him. Then I protected him.",28,119
1q0m9la,,"Then I started losing my nerve, told him I was gonna do something about it. Next thing I knew he was dead.",22,120
1q0m9la,,"Figured it was my fault, but now I think that was the plan all along. Everything was building up to this.",21,121
1q0m9la,,"All of it.”

Caleb ran the back of his hand across his nose, sniffing thickly.",15,122
1q0m9la,,"“One night last year Frankie came home on one of his days off, stinking of smoke.",16,123
1q0m9la,,"His fingernails were black— I couldn’t sleep, so I was in the living room watching TV when he came in. He hadn’t been expecting me.",25,124
1q0m9la,,"Stopped dead when he saw me, and right away I knew he’d been up to something. Came out with some excuse.",21,125
1q0m9la,,"He was a good liar, but he was my brother. I knew him. And I didn’t buy a single word. I kind of just left it for a while.",29,126
1q0m9la,,Hoped I was wrong and he really had been camping or whatever he said he’d been doing. But after that I had insomnia for a while.,26,127
1q0m9la,,Couldn’t sleep more than a few hours a night. Stayed up late and kept on catching him the same way.,20,128
1q0m9la,,Smelling like he’d been in a fire when he hadn’t called in at the station. I tried to think of ways to get the truth out of him.,28,129
1q0m9la,,"I’m not confrontational, you know?",5,130
1q0m9la,,"But in the end he sat down right there where you’re sitting now and he told me all by himself.”

As if some inner resolve had broken Caleb reached over and took one of the beer cans.",37,131
1q0m9la,,"He didn’t drink from it, just sat there holding it in both hands, toying with the ring pull. “Frankie said he always had this thing about fire.",27,132
1q0m9la,,"He was drawn to it. Fascinated. For a while he thought he wanted to save people from it, and that’s what it was all about.",25,133
1q0m9la,,It’s why he worked so hard to get into the fire department. For the first couple of years he thought he had it right. That was what he wanted.,29,134
1q0m9la,,"But then there was some incident where a lady died, the first time you couldn’t get somebody out alive.”

“I remember,” I said. “She was elderly.",26,135
1q0m9la,,Smoking in bed and the place just lit up. Furniture fell across the door in the room she was in. She was dead by the time we got to her.,30,136
1q0m9la,,"I’ll never forget it.”

I tried not to think about how she’d looked, the stink of fat going up on her body, cooking on her bones.",26,137
1q0m9la,,"In fact I’d blocked it out so well over the years that what I remembered most about that night was how Frankie’s face had looked through his visor, the black of his dark eyes like some dead thing burned.",39,138
1q0m9la,,"We’d seen worse responding to various emergencies since then: little kids killed in vehicular accidents, whole families torn apart by gas explosions, pieces strewn all over the ground for us to find.",32,139
1q0m9la,,"But the first death you ever see sticks with you, changes you in a way you can’t undo no matter how far you grow away from it.",27,140
1q0m9la,,"That had happened to Frankie, I knew, but it had happened to me, too.",14,141
1q0m9la,,I’d never been able to stand the smell of cigarettes since that day and would leave the room whenever my grandma sparked one up; none of my stories ever got her to quit.,33,142
1q0m9la,,"“Frankie would never talk about that call,” I said. “What did he tell you?”

Caleb swung forward slightly in his seat like he was going to be sick.",28,143
1q0m9la,,"“He said when he saw the dead woman on fire he got— excited about it. Like, he was so worked up he got paranoid you’d notice.",26,144
1q0m9la,,"Guess you never did, though. Well, Frankie couldn’t stop thinking about what he saw, wishing somehow he’d had a hand in what happened to the old lady.",27,145
1q0m9la,,Kept imagining how he would have got that fire going himself without anybody figuring out it was arson.,18,146
1q0m9la,,After he’d been on the squad long enough he started to learn how people got away with it for insurance fraud and shit like that.,25,147
1q0m9la,,"He didn’t do anything with it for a while, though. Just kept his head down and did the work.",19,148
1q0m9la,,"Tried to act normal even though every time someone died in a blaze he got worked up over it.”

All the time Caleb talked I was shifting restlessly in my chair, always at the point of leaving and never quite able to do it.",44,149
1q0m9la,,"In the end, Caleb told me, Frankie had started sneaking out on some of his nights off, meaning to scratch the itch that had started in Ms Hodgson’s house.",29,150
1q0m9la,,"There were lonely people all over town he knew from various calls he’d made over the years, people who were old, or sick, or mentally unsound.",26,151
1q0m9la,,"People whose families didn’t go by enough, or that didn’t have family at all.",14,152
1q0m9la,,There was an old guy on the outskirts of town that lived by himself and was generally sound asleep by 9pm most nights on account of the cocktail of drugs he was taking to manage an illness.,37,153
1q0m9la,,"Frankie paid the house a visit, able to get in through an unlocked door at the back unnoticed.",18,154
1q0m9la,,"Once inside he had, in Caleb’s words, ‘done something’; whether he’d turned the stove on or messed with the electrics Frankie wouldn’t say, smiling over the secret even as he refused to give it up.",35,155
1q0m9la,,"All that he’d admit was that he rigged the house to burn in some way he was confident wouldn’t be flagged as intentional and left the building to watch from a distance, waiting for his work to pay off.",39,156
1q0m9la,,"Sure enough the house went up in flames, and though Frankie couldn’t see the old man die he knew he wasn’t getting out alive.",24,157
1q0m9la,,"He sat, smelling the smoke, watching the fire eat up the building and everything in it, pleased with what he’d done. In love with it, as Caleb put it.",29,158
1q0m9la,,"In love with the high that came of having power over another person’s life that way, and of their death.",20,159
1q0m9la,,Every couple of months Frankie would slip out by night and move in on a new target.,17,160
1q0m9la,,"Over time he’d developed what he called ‘fire traps’, a way of roughly timing the ignition so that he could be present when the call came through to the station.",30,161
1q0m9la,,"I’d been with him for many of those incidents, fought hard to get out every person caught in their burning homes unharmed.",22,162
1q0m9la,,"I’d always thought Frankie had been just as dedicated, pushing forward against the flames to carry anyone he found to safety and crouching, silent, by himself for a good while afterwards when his efforts failed.",35,163
1q0m9la,,"Beating himself up over the tragedy, I’d always assumed; now I knew he’d been savoring it, committing the sight and smells of death to memory.",25,164
1q0m9la,,"I grappled the urge to put my head between my knees and puke. “I can’t fucking believe it,” I said.",20,165
1q0m9la,,"“I can’t believe this is real.”

Caleb looked at me with huge, dull eyes. “It gets worse. I told Frankie I was going to hand him in.",27,166
1q0m9la,,"Made something up about him being caught by a security camera, there being enough footage and evidence to nail him— Hell, there probably is. I don’t know.",27,167
1q0m9la,,"I don’t know if I could have even gone through with sending him to jail. But I guess I convinced Frankie, because he got this look in his eyes.",29,168
1q0m9la,,"I can’t even describe it. So fucking cold and— smug.”

Caleb took a noisy swig of the beer, spilling part of it. “I thought he’d run off somewhere,” he said.",30,169
1q0m9la,,“Skip town maybe. But the last thing he said to me was how he wasn’t done with the fire traps. How he needed to see one work close up.,29,170
1q0m9la,,"Wanted to know how it’d feel. Then he left, and— well, you know how Frankie died.”

In a weak voice I said, “You’re saying he killed Jenny.",27,171
1q0m9la,,"Killed himself...”

“He did.”

Caleb and I watched each other from either side of the room, both of us flattened by the same weight.",24,172
1q0m9la,,"“So why is he back?” I asked. “Is he just screwing with me, or—”

The pieces came together for me even before Caleb answered.",24,173
1q0m9la,,"“I guess Frankie just wanted to set a few more fires,” he said, “just to see if he could.”




Though the only evidence I had was Caleb’s word I reported the arson to the police, or as much of it as I was able to, knowing I’d have no chance of blaming the latest rash of incidents on a ghost.",60,174
1q0m9la,,"In the cases where there was enough proof to support my claims the deaths were reclassified as murder, giving the surviving family members who’d always had a lingering sense of doubt over the loss some kind of closure.",38,175
1q0m9la,,"As for myself, I never saw Frankie again, though I remained with the department for several years after that.",19,176
1q0m9la,,I had no way of telling if the haunting was over or if he kept on starting fires unseen the way he had before.,24,177
1q0m9la,,"Some nights I’d stay up till morning trying to understand why Frankie had shown himself to Darrell and me, but in the end the closest I felt I got to the truth was the idea that he’d wanted his friends to know who he really was down to the blackened bones of him.",53,178

1q0m422,,"The gig? Quality control tester for shrimp. Yeah, you heard that right. My job is to eat shrimp. Or at least, what I thought was shrimp. It started innocently enough.",30,3
1q0m422,,"I saw the ad on a job board online: “No experience necessary. Competitive pay. Must have a strong stomach and no seafood allergies.” I figured, why not?",27,4
1q0m422,,I’d been laid off from my last position at a cannery—something about automation replacing human hands—and my savings were dwindling faster than the tide recedes.,25,5
1q0m422,,"The interview was a joke: a quick chat with a bored HR rep named Marlene, who handed me a form and a pen.",23,6
1q0m422,,"“Sign here, and you’re in,” she said, her eyes glazed like she’d repeated the line a thousand times.",18,7
1q0m422,,"The warehouse was massive, a labyrinth of conveyor belts, humming freezers, and the constant clatter of machinery.",17,8
1q0m422,,"My station was in a sterile white room at the back, isolated from the main floor.",16,9
1q0m422,,"It was called the “Tasting Lab,” but it felt more like a clinical exam room—fluorescent lights buzzing overhead, a metal table with a stool, and a one-way mirror on the wall that I swore someone was always watching from behind.",40,10
1q0m422,,"Every day, I’d clock in, don a hairnet and gloves, and wait for the samples.",15,11
1q0m422,,"The process was simple: A slot in the wall would open, and a tray would slide out with ten to fifteen shrimp, peeled and deveined, sometimes raw, sometimes cooked in various seasonings.",32,12
1q0m422,,"I’d eat them one by one, noting texture, flavor, freshness on a digital tablet. Too salty? Mark it. Rubbery? Flag it. Off-putting aftertaste? Report it.",25,13
1q0m422,,"Then, the tray would retract, and another would appear. Eight hours a day, five days a week. It was monotonous, but the pay was $25 an hour, plus benefits.",29,14
1q0m422,,"In Port Haven, that was a king’s ransom. At first, I loved it.",13,15
1q0m422,,"Shrimp had always been a guilty pleasure—cocktail shrimp at parties, shrimp scampi on date nights back when I had those.",20,16
1q0m422,,"The samples were premium: plump, juicy, with that briny snap you only get from fresh catch.",16,17
1q0m422,,"I’d chew slowly, savoring the burst of ocean flavor, the subtle sweetness beneath the salt.",15,18
1q0m422,,"My notes were glowing: “Excellent firmness,” “Perfect balance of umami,” “No fishy undertone.” I even started dreaming about shrimp—endless platters floating in a sea of cocktail sauce.",27,19
1q0m422,,"But around week three, things got… weird. It started with the textures.",12,20
1q0m422,,"One batch felt off, like the meat was too fibrous, almost stringy, as if threads of something tougher were woven in.",21,21
1q0m422,,"I noted it: “Slightly chewy, possible over-processing.” The next day, another tray came with shrimp that wriggled faintly when I picked them up.",23,22
1q0m422,,"I blinked, thinking it was a trick of the light, but no—tiny spasms, like they weren’t quite dead. “Residual nerve activity?” I typed, my fingers hesitating.",26,23
1q0m422,,"In the cannery days, I’d seen fish twitch post-mortem, but shrimp? They were supposed to be inert. I mentioned it to Marlene during my weekly check-in.",26,24
1q0m422,,"She laughed it off, her voice tinny over the intercom. “Oh, that’s just the new sourcing. We’re testing deep-sea varieties—fresher than fresh.",22,25
1q0m422,,"Keeps the flavor locked in.” I nodded, but a seed of doubt planted itself. Deep-sea shrimp? I’d never heard of such a thing being commercially viable.",26,26
1q0m422,,"Port Haven’s waters were shallow, battered by storms, not the abyssal depths. As weeks turned to months, the anomalies piled up.",21,27
1q0m422,,"Some shrimp had an iridescent sheen, like oil on water, shifting colors under the lights—blue to green to purple.",19,28
1q0m422,,"Others tasted metallic, a coppery tang that lingered on my tongue for hours. I started getting headaches after shifts, pounding migraines that blurred my vision.",25,29

1q0m422,,"Bioluminescent shapes darted around me, not fish, but elongated things with too many segments, glowing eyes clustered in rows. They pulsed with light, beckoning.",24,32
1q0m422,,"I reached out, and one latched onto my hand, its mouthparts unfolding like petals. I woke up gasping, my palm itching where nothing was there.",25,33
1q0m422,,"The next shift, the trays came faster. No breaks between them. I’d barely finish logging one batch before another slid out.",21,34
1q0m422,,"The shrimp were larger now, almost prawn-sized, with veins that pulsed faintly under the translucent flesh. I bit into one, and it squirted—warm, not cold like it should be.",29,35

1q0m422,,"Here’s a bonus.” She slid an envelope across the desk—$500 cash. I took it. Bills don’t pay themselves. That night, the itching intensified.",23,45
1q0m422,,"In the shower, I scratched my forearm raw, and something moved beneath the skin. A ripple, like a worm burrowing. I stared, water cascading over me, convinced it was hallucination.",30,46

1q0m422,,"Under my kitchen light, magnified with a cheap loupe I’d bought online, the truth stared back. They weren’t shrimp. Segmented bodies, jointed legs folded tight, mandibles tucked beneath.",28,53

The lights dimmed. The one-way mirror cleared, revealing not a observation room, but darkness. An abyss, lit by faint bioluminescence. Shapes moved beyond—massive, segmented, familiar.",28,59
1q0m422,,"I looked down at my hands. The skin split painlessly, peeling back like a shell. Beneath, something pale and jointed flexed. Legs? Feelers? The tray arrived then, empty. An invitation.",30,60
1q0m422,,"I understood. My job wasn’t to test shrimp. It was to become the vessel. To carry them inland, spread the brood. The whispers clarified: We are the tide that returns.",30,61

*How… do you imagine yourself dying?*

*Tell me how.*

*Now*.",32,56

1q0g48d,,"His words did not cut; they pierced through the skin of my face. With every swirl, my skin felt more scraped.",21,58
1q0g48d,,He stopped his interrogation only when he found my replies creative. He liked the funny ones. Rarely liked the anticlimactic ones. He smiled widely at the gory ones.,28,59
1q0g48d,,He often seemed intrigued by the sad ones.,8,60
1q0g48d,,And he absolutely despised the AI‑generated horseshit I tried to make; his wordless rage then scraped not just my skin but the entire space I existed in.,27,61

1q0g48d,,I felt grateful to the divine for bringing me closer to my family. Yet I felt more otherworldly than familial. It is hard to articulate.,25,69

1q0g48d,,All my faith crumbled and re‑formed into a single belief: Death was the ultimate religion. “Near‑death experience” might be the closest phrase for that serene feeling.,26,71

1q0g48d,,I always felt he was an organism burdened—probably by the constant work of engineering deaths. I felt the divinity of his work in his commanding questions and screams.,28,73
1q0g48d,,His abrasive tongue felt like a godly purgatory made just for me. His physicality inside my mind seemed hollow yet heavy. Everything and nothing coming together at the same time.,30,74
1q0g48d,,Monochromatic. Extreme. Harsh. Yet blissful. A chaotic calmness. Divine.,9,75

“I hope so. It’s completely different from where I came from.”

The ride was short. He chatted about little things—tips about the neighborhood, funny stories from locals.",22,7

I smiled politely.",24,10
1q0bvy3,,"Honestly, I didn’t remember any of it. “Feels like ages ago,” I muttered. “An eternity,” she nodded. “Your mom and I have known each other forever.",26,11

1q0bvy3,,"A new chapter doesn’t write itself—you’ll need your strength.”

“Please just leave,” I said firmly. Not the best welcome.",24,16

“Walls are thin. Keep the noise down. Lock your doors.",27,18

“I… will remember.”

He stared for a moment, then left without another word. I unpacked a little, half-heartedly, and eventually collapsed into bed.",30,19
1q0bvy3,,"The next day passed with boxes, cleaning, and organizing. My mom sent a reminder about finding a job, so I applied to a small café nearby.",26,20
1q0bvy3,,"A few hours later, someone named Lila reached out—I was to come by that evening. That night, I met her at the café. “Hey, glad you’re here.",27,21
1q0bvy3,,"How’s the first day in the new place?”

“Chaotic. But I’m managing.”

“Moves are always chaos. Need any help?”

“No, I’m fine. Just trying to settle in.”

She smiled.",29,22
1q0bvy3,,"“Don’t stress. We brought you in last minute—our last server quit overnight. You’re a lifesaver.”

I worked my first shift. It went better than I expected.",26,23

“Ethan,” he introduced himself. “Hey… do you use social media?”

1q0bvy3,,"In the stairwell, Ethan startled me again. “No ‘thank you’?”

He kept repeating himself. Same phrases, like it was rehearsed. At the café, Lila appeared with a bruised eye.",29,31

I recoiled, almost automatically. I ended up in the bedroom, hands shaking so much I could barely hold my phone.",27,39

“What kind of barbecue?” said Sudip. “Um, American?” I said. Angus took off his headset again.",22,3

Shawn walked in with his perfectly starched shirt and blue blazer mocking the company polos the other three were wearing.",26,4
1q02h5o,,"As the sales and marketing guy, he had to put a handsome face forward. “Send it in the group chat, why don’t you?",23,5
1q02h5o,,"It’s like talking to your grandparents with these three.” He smiled at me. “What was that, Shawn?",17,6
1q02h5o,,"Sorry, I was too locked in using my masters degree to program something very complex,” said Sudip.",17,7
1q02h5o,,"“Do we need to make a powerpoint to explain it to the sales guy?” said Richie, a smirk on his face. “Sure, I’ll schedule a lunch meeting in a year.",30,8

I nodded in thanks as Richie, Angus, and Sudip turned back to their computers and Shawn went to his office.",32,13

Allie’s female voice, not unlike my own, washed over the speakers. “Doordash estimates your delivery will arrive in twenty minutes.",29,18

“Yes. Have them use the cart from the front desk.”

“Great.",22,19
1q02h5o,,"I’ll notify the security desk to direct them to this room.”

“Thanks, Allie.”

Allie was fairly useful and very friendly for a glorified AI chatbot.",25,20

1q02h5o,,I pointed out that someone still had to move tables and chairs around the conference rooms.,16,26
1q02h5o,,"Richie then informed me that robot tables and chairs would soon arrange themselves, and they were building Allie with a feature to do that.",24,27

“Go ahead,” I said. “Allie, turn the room over to Shawn.",20,31

I double checked my email invitations as I half listened to Shawn’s presentation practice in the background.",25,32

1q02h5o,,"He had previously told me how presenting made him nervous and he sometimes felt sick beforehand. “You feel ok?” I asked him. “Of course,” he said.",26,41
1q02h5o,,"“I have to.”

“I’m sure Duncan could cover for you.”

“No, that’s beneath him.”

“What about Sudip or Richie? Angus?”

He chuckled. “Then we’d never be bought.",27,42
1q02h5o,,"Besides, this is what I get paid to do.”

“Well I could do it.”

“You?”

“Why not? I heard you give your presentation earlier.”

“Hmm. Maybe.",26,43
1q02h5o,,"You’re made of pretty sharp stuff.”

Duncan was wrapping up his opening. “Alright, I’m up. How do I look, April?”

“You look great.",23,44
1q02h5o,,"Though your tie is a little off center.”

Shawn straightened his tie. “Wish me luck.”

The presentation was perfect.",19,45
1q02h5o,,"I couldn’t even tell he was nervous, and as the audience clapped and he turned it back over to Duncan, I felt it was my duty to chide him.",29,46
1q02h5o,,"“How’d I do?” he said, a big smile on his face. “Nice work.",13,47
1q02h5o,,"But you did so well they might think they were buying you instead of Allie.”

“Well if I want to be on their sales team, I’ve got to show value somehow.”	

Duncan made a joke, then started with his conclusion.",40,48
1q02h5o,,"“Thanks to Shawn for that excellent presentation of Allie’s capabilities. And before we open the floor to questions, I thought we’d have a little fun.",25,49

1q02h5o,,"So, trusting the programming team did their job, Allie, why don’t you show us what you look like?”

“Of course, Duncan.” The pulsing orb faded from the screen.",28,52
1q02h5o,,"A woman’s figure stepped onto the screen. She was short and slim, with brown hair that fell in waves past her shoulders.",22,53
1q02h5o,,She had freckles on both cheeks and wore a business suit. Her smile had a small gap in her front teeth. She waved hello to the audience.,27,54
1q02h5o,,"She looked exactly like me. The audience clapped. “Hello, everyone,” she said in my voice. “Glad to make your acquaintance. I look forward to working with you in the future.",30,55
1q02h5o,,"Let me know when you’re ready to start.”

Eyes transfixed in frozen horror on the smiling visage of myself, I leaned over to Shawn.",24,56
1q02h5o,,"“Why does it look like me?”

“What? It doesn’t look like you.”

“Seriously?” I said, my breath turning shallow.",19,57
1q02h5o,,"“Ok, maybe it looks a little similar, but I’m sure it’s a coincidence.",13,58
1q02h5o,,"I mean, the outfit is different.” 

He was right about that, but it didn’t make me feel any better.",19,59
1q02h5o,,"“I don’t like it.”

He turned to me and realized the height of my concern. “Hey, don’t think too much into it.",22,60
1q02h5o,,"If it was a mistake, I’m sure we could talk to the programmers about updating it in the 1.1 patch.",20,61
1q02h5o,,"No biggie.”

My anxiety continued to rise as I watched myself answer questions from the audience on subjects I knew nothing about for the next forty-five minutes.",27,62
1q02h5o,,"As the clients left, it was like no one had noticed. “Thanks for the barbecue, April,” Richie said, walking by me. “Yeah, thanks,” echoed Sudip and Angus.",27,63

1q02h5o,,"Could you schedule a happy hour for this Friday?”

“Yeah, sure, Duncan. I’ll get on that.”

“Ok great. Thanks Allie,” he said, turning back to his office.",27,69
1q02h5o,,"“Hmm?”

“I said, thanks April. I’m taking off.”

“Oh, yeah. You’re welcome. Have a good night.”

He turned back to his office.",22,70
1q02h5o,,"“Allie, log me out for today.”

My voice and image answered from the computer with a smile and a wave. “I’ll do that.",23,71
1q02h5o,,"Have a good night, sir.”

I got to my apartment and cried on the couch for two hours.",18,72

1q02h5o,,"I knew he had a soft spot for me, which might help him open up. “Hey Angus?” I said, standing up and walking across the room.",26,81
1q02h5o,,"He jumped visibly, then clicked something and replied, “Yeah?”

I walked up and sat on the end of his desk.",20,82
1q02h5o,,"He was wiping his sweaty hands on his pants, and his face was red.",14,83
1q02h5o,,"“Hey, you were in charge of the avatar reveal coding, right?”

“Yeah, I did the code for it.” His fat fingers left sweat marks on his keyboard as he kept typing.",31,84
1q02h5o,,"I put on my dumbest, girliest voice to ask, “What sort of images and videos did you train the AI on?”

He didn’t look at me.",26,85
1q02h5o,,"“Oh, um, it was just a public use data set. I think something pulled from YouTube and other sources.",19,86
1q02h5o,,"I just compiled everything with metadata tags for business woman and secretary. That’s what Shawn and Duncan suggested.”

“Could you send it to me?",24,87
1q02h5o,,"The folder?”

“I mean, it’s public data compiled through a program. I can send you a link to some of it, I guess.",23,88
1q02h5o,,"Otherwise, that would be, like, several Terabytes of data.”

“Oh, ok, that’d be great!",14,89
1q02h5o,,"Thanks Angus!”

“Uh, yeah sure.”

“Why do you want to know?” said Richie, taking off his headset. “Oh not really any specific reason.",23,90
1q02h5o,,"I just thought it would be interesting to get an idea of what the data looks like, and pictures seemed easiest to understand.”

“Hmm.” He grunted, then turned back to his computer.",32,91
1q02h5o,,"“Hey, where do you guys want to go for a happy hour on Friday? Duncan asked me to plan one.”

“Can’t you just ask Allie to do it?” said Richie.",30,92
1q02h5o,,"“Ha ha. I’m sure she could do it, but Duncan asked me to.”

“I’m fine with whatever,” Richie said.",19,93
1q02h5o,,"“Are you going to come to this one then?”

“Maybe he will go if we go to that one place,” said Sudip. “What place?” I said.",26,94
1q02h5o,,"“Oh, it’s the…um…Allie, what’s the bar with the video game cabinets that Richie likes?”

“Next Level?” I said. “Wait a minute, she’s thinking,” said Sudip.",25,95
1q02h5o,,"“Next Level video bar is Richie’s highest rated bar on Yelp,” said Allie. “Yeah, Next Level,” Sudip said. “I thought you guys hated that place.",25,96
1q02h5o,,"You said it was campy and dumb the last time we went there,” I said. “Well it was. But it was also kind of fun. Good atmosphere,” said Richie.",29,97
1q02h5o,,"“He means the gamer waitresses were hot,” said Angus, laughing in a way that sounded like he needed to blow his nose. Sudip chuckled too.",25,98
1q02h5o,,“You guys could have told me.,6,99
1q02h5o,,"I’ve been planning the happy hours specifically at other bars because I thought you guys didn’t like that one.”

“In my defense, I never said that,” said Sudip.",28,100
1q02h5o,,"“And we thought you were just trying to appeal to Shawn.”

I sighed. “I’m sorry.",15,101
1q02h5o,,"I’ll try to plan better stuff in the future.”

“Told you you should have used Allie,” Richie said. He put his headphones back in and went back to his tickets.",30,102
1q02h5o,,I scheduled the happy hour and spent the rest of the day searching through the files Angus had forwarded to me.,21,103
1q02h5o,,Shawn and Duncan seemed pretty busy on the phone all day. I guessed the launch must have been really successful. Those photos and videos were mostly stock footage.,28,104
1q02h5o,,"Then again, I only manually sorted through about a tenth of a percent of the data set. I decided to use Allie.",22,105
1q02h5o,,"“Allie, search this data repository for images and videos most similar to that of your avatar.”

Allie came back an hour later with thousands of images to comb through.",29,106
1q02h5o,,"I sorted by the most recent. There, at the top of the list, was the video of me setting up the auditorium for lunch the day before.",27,107
1q02h5o,,"“Hey Angus, why are there videos of me in the auditorium in this data?”

“We used the conference room and auditorium cameras for that feature about the moving tables.",29,108
1q02h5o,,"It just tracks the table locations,” said Angus. “Oh. Cool.” I tried to sound as chill as possible.",18,109
1q02h5o,,"I made my way to Duncan’s office once he was in between client calls. “Hey Duncan?”

“Hey April, come on in. Sorry I didn’t even say hello yet today.",29,110
1q02h5o,,"We’ve already been getting so much good client feedback. They specifically really like the avatar. Guess that study was true.”

“Actually that was something I wanted to ask you about.",30,111
1q02h5o,,"I just think it looks really similar to me.”

Duncan’s brow furrowed as I continued.",15,112
1q02h5o,,"“And I don’t know if there’s anything to do about it, but I just wanted to make it known since I’m one of the team.”

Duncan pulled up Allie in a window on his computer and looked back and forth between the avatar and myself.",45,113
1q02h5o,,"“Hmm, I hadn’t noticed. I mean, there is some similarity. I think Allie looks different enough. I mean, the clothes are different.",22,114
1q02h5o,,"Does it make you uncomfortable?”

“I mean, it’s just strange.”

“Do you want me to talk to the team about changing it?",22,115
1q02h5o,,"I’m sure they could manage that around their tickets and publish it with the next patch.”

“I didn’t realize it would take so much work.",25,116
1q02h5o,,"I thought they could just ask it to make a new appearance.”

“A little more went into the reveal than that, April.",22,117
1q02h5o,,"But I’m willing to change it if you need it.”

“Oh, no, no, I didn’t want to make trouble.”

Duncan sat back in his chair and ran his hands through his hair.",32,118
1q02h5o,,"“Say, April, why don’t you take the rest of the day off? You’ve been working hard lately, and I don’t want you to get overworked.",25,119
1q02h5o,,"We’ll see you tomorrow, does that sound alright?”

I was caught off guard. “Sure, ok. Thanks, Duncan.”

“Of course, April.",20,120
1q02h5o,,"Get some rest.”

I felt lower than ever when I got back to the office the next day. The vibe was really strange.",23,121
1q02h5o,,"Richie, Angus, and Sudip were weirdly quiet, but they would message each other and start laughing at something if I left the room.",23,122
1q02h5o,,"When I’d come back, they’d close windows on their computer and get silent, shooting me glances out of the corner of their eyes.",23,123
1q02h5o,,"When the guys were ready to leave for their lunch, I watched them close their computers.",16,124
1q02h5o,,There was a picture of me sent through their private chat on Richie’s screen I could see. Or maybe it was Allie.,22,125
1q02h5o,,It felt really weird that they were passing around images like that. It made me feel gross.,17,126
1q02h5o,,Some sick curiosity told me I needed to know more of what they were doing. I stood and said goodbye to them as they left for the happy hour.,29,127
1q02h5o,,I let them know I had to catch up on something before I could meet them there.,17,128
1q02h5o,,"The office had gone quiet, as Duncan had gone for dinner with a client. I sat back down at my computer and pulled up the administrator controls.",27,129
1q02h5o,,"Duncan showed me how to do it once to retrieve info that had been deleted from our chat history, and I didn’t figure I would ever use it again.",29,130
1q02h5o,,"After struggling to remember a few commands, I found the company’s whole chat history, updated just fifteen minutes before I had opened it.",23,131
1q02h5o,,"Through the numerous client contacts expressing their admiration for Allie, I found the private internal channel between Sudip, Richie, and Angus.",21,132
1q02h5o,,I started to scroll but didn't have to wait long to find what made my stomach churn.,17,133
1q02h5o,,The guys had added an exclusive side feature to Allie I bet even Duncan didn’t know about: an image and video generator.,22,134
1q02h5o,,What I proceeded to scroll through for the next hour were hundreds of sexual pictures of me. All of them had the little Allie logo in the bottom right corner.,30,135
1q02h5o,,"I barely made it to the bathroom before I threw up. I spent another hour there, sobbing on the floor.",20,136
1q02h5o,,"Feeling like an empty husk, I limped back to my desk and closed the administrator window. I didn’t know what to do. Motion stirred in the room.",27,137
1q02h5o,,"“April?” came Shawn’s voice from his office. He looked out from his doorway, his eyes tired and his shirt rumpled.",20,138
1q02h5o,,"“Sorry, Shawn, I didn’t know you were still here,” I said, drying my eyes with a tissue.",17,139
1q02h5o,,"“I had a lot of client calls today.” He walked towards me, looking around to see if anyone else was here.",21,140
1q02h5o,,"“What’s wrong?”

“I just…I just had a really bad day.”

“Man, I’m really sorry.” He came over and sat on my desk and put his hand on my shoulder.",29,141
1q02h5o,,"“Do you want to talk about it?”

“I don’t know, I just…I don’t know how to-” In a moment of weakness, I gave him a hug. He softened into it.",30,142
1q02h5o,,"“It’s ok. It’s been one of those days,” he said. “Yeah,” I whispered against his chest. We stood a little longer.",21,143
1q02h5o,,I needed to feel his warmth to burn away all the disgusting feelings swirling like a sewer drain inside of me. I let go of him once I felt better.,30,144
1q02h5o,,"“Sorry, I don’t know what got into me, I just-”

“It’s ok. You doing anything tonight?” he said.",18,145
1q02h5o,,"“Well, I think I probably missed the happy hour,” I said, giving a weak laugh. “At that video game bar? I liked that place.”

“Now everyone tells me that.”

“Sorry.",30,146
1q02h5o,,How about you let me make it up to you by buying you a drink?” He gave a very charming smile that made me feel safe.,26,147
1q02h5o,,"“Yeah, I’d like that very much,” I said. “Where at?”

“How about down the street at Elevate? I can drive you home afterwards.”

“That sounds nice.”

“Ok, great.",28,148
1q02h5o,,"Let me shut down my computer and I’ll meet you downstairs.”

We made our way just down the block to the cocktail bar bathed in neon.",26,149
1q02h5o,,"Shawn ordered me a margarita that I loved, and he had a whiskey.",13,150
1q02h5o,,"Before long, the alcohol was loosening my tongue and making me forget the office and the programmers and the images.",20,151
1q02h5o,,I couldn’t tell if Shawn was more charming when he was buzzed or if I just found everything more hilarious.,20,152
1q02h5o,,"Everything was so natural, and he was so charismatic that I found myself questioning why we hadn’t started this sooner. Shawn just knew the perfect questions to ask.",28,153
1q02h5o,,I attributed it to his sales and marketing knowledge. We had a couple more drinks and the hours flew by. We left the bar around midnight.,26,154
1q02h5o,,"Since we were too drunk to drive, Shawn suggested he could walk me the few blocks to my apartment and he could Uber home.",24,155
1q02h5o,,I slid my arm into his and snuggled close against the cold.,12,156
1q02h5o,,"I forgot how beautiful my neighborhood was at night, and how nice it felt to have someone close to me.",20,157
1q02h5o,,"“Can I walk you up to your place?” He asked as we reached the front door. “Sure,” I said.",19,158
1q02h5o,,"“The neighborhood is really safe, but I’d appreciate the company.”

My arm stayed locked to his as we rode the elevator to the third floor.",25,159
1q02h5o,,"He turned and smiled at me. “You know I’m really glad you took the job with us.”

“Hmm. Yeah,” I said. The alcohol was starting to make me sleepy.",29,160
1q02h5o,,"“And I want you to know that I really appreciate all the work you do.”

“Thanks.”

“You bring a really great atmosphere to the office, and you’re always so helpful.",30,161
1q02h5o,,"And even if we get acquired and things change, I’d still like to spend time with you.”

“Yeah, I’d like that too.”

The elevator dinged, and we walked down the hall to my apartment.",34,162
1q02h5o,,Shawn continued.,2,163
1q02h5o,,"“You know, it’s really kind of crazy we managed to get Allie up and running, and it’s impressive how effective it is.”

“Mhmm.” My bed would be so comfortable at this hour.",32,164
1q02h5o,,"We got to my door, and I turned to him. “Thanks for walking me home.",15,165
1q02h5o,,"I really appreciate it.”

“Yeah, of course.” He stood there like he was expecting me to say more. “Are you gonna ask me in?” he said.",26,166
1q02h5o,,"“I’m just really tired, and I’d like to get some rest,” I said with a smile.",16,167
1q02h5o,,"“But thank you for the drinks.”

“Well it’s the weekend tomorrow.”

“I’m just…it’s been a long day, and, um, I have a rule that I don’t sleep with a guy on the first date.”

“Hmm.” His brow furrowed.",38,168
1q02h5o,,"“Are you sure?”

“Yeah, it’s something I think is healthy.”

“That’s weird. Allie didn’t mention that.”

Those four words sobered me up.",22,169
1q02h5o,,"“What?”

“Allie doesn’t have a rule that she doesn’t sleep with a guy on the first date.” Shawn spoke almost as an aside, “man, it was so accurate up to this point, even down to the drink order and what floor you lived on.”

That pit in my stomach opened again as the life drained out of me.",58,170
1q02h5o,,"My lip started to quiver. “Sorry. I need to go.”

“It’s ok.” He looked nonchalant.",15,171
1q02h5o,,"“Guess Allie just didn’t have all the information.”

I fumbled for my keys and opened my door, my hands shaking.",20,172
1q02h5o,,"“Bye Shawn.”

“Bye, April.”

The next two days passed in a haze of vodka and tears. I didn’t know what I was supposed to do. I didn’t have any PTO.",30,173
1q02h5o,,I couldn’t quit because I barely had any savings and no plans for how to get home.,17,174
1q02h5o,,"When Monday morning rolled around, all I could think was to put on a brave face and try again.",19,175
1q02h5o,,Nobody even looked up from their desks when I walked into the office. Nobody commented on the bags under my eyes or the tangles in my hair.,27,176
1q02h5o,,"My inbox was empty, as were any notifications for new events Duncan wanted planned, all of them having been addressed by Allie. I sat at my computer and opened Allie.",30,177
1q02h5o,,"I stared at the reflection, now much more put together than myself, and thought of the myriad of questions I could ask it to see if it was truly me.",30,178
1q02h5o,,But then what data could it not just collect from my questions? It was 10:30 am when Duncan called me into his office.,23,179
1q02h5o,,"“Good morning, April,” he said with a smile. “Good morning, Duncan. Anything you need me to do?”

“Come in and sit down.”

I sat.",24,180
1q02h5o,,"“How has feedback from clients been?”

“Wonderful, just wonderful. They couldn’t be happier with the 1.0 launch. That’s actually the reason that I wanted to talk.",26,181
1q02h5o,,"You see, we’re being acquired.”

“We are? It’s so soon after the launch.”

“Like I’ve said, the clients see a future with our product.",24,182
1q02h5o,,"And now that we’re being acquired, some of us will move on to new and better things.",17,183
1q02h5o,,"I’ve told the team already, but Richie, Sudip, and Angus are all being hired to continue support and work on other AI tools.",23,184
1q02h5o,,Shawn impressed the buyer so much that they asked him to join their sales team.,15,185
1q02h5o,,"And I’m off to take a vacation before I get back to the plow on another startup investment.”

The silence between us could have lasted for days.",27,186
1q02h5o,,"“So what does that mean for me?” I finally asked. “That’s a great question. Since we’ve started using Allie internally, she’s carrying a majority of your workload.",27,187
1q02h5o,,I’m prepared to give you the rest of the week off on PTO and then let you search for other employment opportunities.,22,188
1q02h5o,,"The buyer already has an extensive administrative support team, and with Allie on their side, that soon will be unnecessary.”

“This is my last day?”

“That’s correct.",27,189
1q02h5o,,"Friday will be your last paycheck. Don’t worry, there will be an acquisition bonus on there of a few thousand dollars to help you out.",25,190
1q02h5o,,"But again, April, we’re so incredibly thankful for your work. Feel free to take the rest of the morning to pack your things, say goodbye to the team.",28,191
1q02h5o,,"Then you can leave after lunch.”

“I…ok, thanks.”

Duncan gave me a handshake. I walked to my desk in a stupor.",21,192
1q02h5o,,I heard him ask Allie to plan a company dinner at a fancy restaurant for five later in the week.,20,193
1q02h5o,,"I gathered the few things I had at my desk into my bag, then turned my computer in to Duncan.",20,194
1q02h5o,,"As I stood outside his office, Angus, Richie, and Sudip didn’t look up. I decided not to say goodbye to them.",21,195
1q02h5o,,I watched that scroll away from pictures of me as I went to Shawn’s office.,15,196
1q02h5o,,"I knocked on the door frame and peaked my head in, hoping that whatever had happened on Friday night was some bad dream blown out of proportion by alcohol.",29,197
1q02h5o,,"“Hey Shawn?”

“Yeah?”

“It’s my last day.” I searched for any hint of warmth in his voice. “Oh yeah.",19,198
1q02h5o,,"The acquisition thing.”

“Yeah, well, I just wanted to say goodbye and um, see if you wanted to talk about Friday at all.”

“I didn’t know there was much to talk about.”

“There’s not?”

“Yeah, I’m just not interested.",39,199
1q02h5o,,"Listen, April, I’ve got a big onboarding meeting with my new company in a few minutes, so if you don’t mind…”

“Yeah, sorry. Hope it goes well for you.”

“Thanks.",30,200
1q02h5o,,"Allie, how do I look?”

“You look good, but-” I said. My own voice cut me off. “You look great, Shawn. But your tie is slightly crooked.",27,201
1q02h5o,,"Try shifting it to the right.”

I left the office in silence. It’s been two days of sitting in my apartment. I have no idea what I’m supposed to do.",30,202
1q02h5o,,I barely have any savings. I wasn’t planning to move home this early. I don’t know what to do. I’ve never felt so alone.,24,203
1pzydrq,The Deer Pit,I can still remember how the steam pulsed in steady rhythm from beneath the frozen leaves.,16,0
1pzydrq,,When I was a kid I had this place I would go to on the frozen mornings of winter.,19,1
1pzydrq,,A clearing that never seemed to suffer under the cruel frosts of eastern Tennessee.,14,2
1pzydrq,,"The clearing was set deep in the woods, far enough away from civilization that the sound of rubber tearing across tarmac bled away into abject silence.",26,3
1pzydrq,,"Living so close to the interstate, even in a town as small as mine, left peaceful moments as a rare commodity.",21,4
1pzydrq,,"Everywhere I went, I could hear the distant ribbon of passing cars rumbling towards far-off places. I treasured the clearing.",20,5
1pzydrq,,The pristine silence there so stark and thin I felt that even a single breath might cause it to burst.,20,6
1pzydrq,,"It had been a balm for my soul, and its warmth a salve for my aching limbs after long days at school.",22,7
1pzydrq,,"Seventh grade was when the cracks began to show, all starting with the disappearance of Heinrich Einsam.",17,8
1pzydrq,,"Heinrich had been an exchange student from Germany, a pudgy kid with suede blonde hair and eyes the color of emeralds. I had known him, but only just barely.",29,9
1pzydrq,,He had been in town for a couple of weeks.,10,10
1pzydrq,,In those two weeks the shifty-eyed kid with the messy hair had yet to make eye contact with me or anybody else.,22,11
1pzydrq,,"I could recognize it for what it was, an attempt to become invisible. To shrink himself down so small that the starving, gluttonous egos of burgeoning adults might overlook him.",30,12
1pzydrq,,The trouble with shrinking yourself away from others; whatever scraps of your personhood remain visible are left entirely up to interpretation. The stories started almost immediately.,26,13
1pzydrq,,The tightness of his lips and constant pale shade of his skin twisted by rumor into some latent sign of wrongdoing.,21,14
1pzydrq,,Heinrich's uncle worked for the department of transportation; specifically in the removal of roadkill. The kids at school would shout accusations at him.,23,15
1pzydrq,,Calling him bizarrely terrible names like Rotmouth and Streeteater. None of us were overly surprised to hear that he had gone missing. We figured he had probably just run away.,30,16
1pzydrq,,"The search was exhaustive, with everybody combing through the Waltmart in the center of town and broadening the search from there until we had covered nearly six miles of woodland.",30,17
1pzydrq,,"I was surprised, at the end of that day, to find myself in the unusually warm clearing.",17,18
1pzydrq,,The afternoon heat of summer shrank away as the sun sank in the west.,14,19
1pzydrq,,The warm air rose from beneath the leaves caressing every part of me; driving the cool evening winds from my bones.,21,20
1pzydrq,,The only sign of him was a scrap of his scalp snagged on a tree branch behind his uncle's house.,20,21
1pzydrq,,"They eventually arrested the uncle, but I got the sense that nobody felt very good about it.",17,22
1pzydrq,,As if it were something they did just so they could say that they had done *something*.,17,23
1pzydrq,,I'm a little ashamed to say I never really thought about him much after he disappeared.,16,24
1pzydrq,,"I moved on with my life as if nothing at all had happened, because from my perspective nothing really had.",20,25
1pzydrq,,"Heinrich had kept himself as something distant, an oddity only to be observed. I had never truly come to know him, and thus had never grown to feel any attachment.",30,26
1pzydrq,,"I was twenty-three years old before I even remembered that he existed. Coming home from college to visit my folks, I found the same shrinking tables I had left behind.",30,27
1pzydrq,,"It seemed as if every year gave cause for one less chair, whether it be death or feud, or simple logistical issues.",22,28
1pzydrq,,"It hurt in a way that sits just beneath the surface. An almost imperceptible, constant agony of loss poisoning the air.",21,29
1pzydrq,,"When the typical, heated, political discussion arose I excused myself from the situation.",13,30
1pzydrq,,"Not due to a lack of interest, simply because I felt that whatever ideological victories might be scored wouldn't be worth the chance of another empty chair.",27,31
1pzydrq,,The woods were as silent as a grave as I trudged past fallen logs. A small family of deer wandered across my path.,23,32
1pzydrq,,I remember wondering what life might be like through their eyes.,11,33
1pzydrq,,"Many people hold animals to be base creatures devoid of real feeling, but I know that's not the case, at least for some.",23,34
1pzydrq,,"Several years prior, when I left for college, I had been driving down country roads on my way to the new school.",22,35
1pzydrq,,"Excitement and possibility danced through my head, the rhythmic joy of it all coming to a screeching halt.",18,36
1pzydrq,,Ahead on the road I could see a young fox laying near the median.,14,37
1pzydrq,,"There were no visible signs of injury, yet even so it was immediately obvious the kit was dead.",18,38
1pzydrq,,"Its mother and siblings crowded around it, prodding gently with their noses, and I could hear through my open window the sounds of their gentle whining.",26,39
1pzydrq,,It was as if I had found myself in the middle of some disastrously disheartening Disney movie.,17,40
1pzydrq,,"I don't know if the animals of earth feel all the same things as you or I, but I know without question that they mourn just as we do.",29,41
1pzydrq,,"I followed the deer at a distance, all the while thinking of my own family, and the family of foxes.",20,42
1pzydrq,,"I was so lost in my aimless, meandering, grief that I didn't even notice when we entered the clearing.",19,43
1pzydrq,,"It was the same as it ever was, the image of swaying trees heaving their heavy branches to and fro.",20,44
1pzydrq,,"The wind carried sweet, warm air to the treeline where it seemed to wrap around every inch of me.",19,45
1pzydrq,,The change in temperature sudden enough that I jumped in slight surprise.,12,46
1pzydrq,,"A flood of memory broke loose in my mind, threatening to carry me away with the torrent of recollection.",19,47
1pzydrq,,"Coming here to cry after Sadie rejected my invitation to the dance, bringing my first girlfriend, Heather, to experience the warmth and tranquility which marked this place.",27,48
1pzydrq,,I was wrenched back from my trip down memory lane by a sudden cacophony of panicked deer calls. I couldn't have looked away for more than a couple of seconds.,30,49
1pzydrq,,"The deer had somehow disappeared from the clearing, with the sound of their desperate cries now oozing up from beneath the leaf-littered ground.",23,50
1pzydrq,,"I don't know if it was down to the state of my own family, or just a streak of naive caring that prompted me to march out and investigate.",29,51
1pzydrq,,The idea of deciding not to intervene never even occurred to me. It just seemed obvious to me that I should help.,22,52
1pzydrq,,"Stomping across the ground, I became aware of a faint groaning clunk, like wet wood under weight.",17,53
1pzydrq,,The deer quieted beneath the thumping of my heavy boots until there was no sound at all.,17,54
1pzydrq,,"I knelt to the ground, clearing half-decayed leaves and revealing a wooden surface much the same. I don't know what came over me.",23,55
1pzydrq,,"Maybe it was desperation to help the deer, or perhaps reckless abandon borne of despair. Maybe even something so simple as ""the call of the void."" 

I jumped. Once. Twice.",30,56
1pzydrq,,"And with the third, the boards gave way. It's never easy to tell how long you were falling.",18,57
1pzydrq,,"Each moment stretches out before you, your mind running uselessly at top speed to find some way of avoiding harm.",20,58
1pzydrq,,"I slammed against a terrain both bumpy and sharp, a great clatter resounding all around me.",16,59
1pzydrq,,"The smell hit me first, a thousand years of rot coated in a thick sheen of freshly baked bread.",19,60
1pzydrq,,"My eyes adjusted slowly to the dim light, the hole where I had fallen through acting as the only window. I was in a pit.",25,61
1pzydrq,,"The size of it was impossible to discern amid the crushing darkness, but the shape was easily surmised from the angle at which the walls were set.",27,62
1pzydrq,,"When finally I could see my fingers, I felt a rush of panicked horror boil throughout my being. The ground here was comprised entirely of bone.",26,63
1pzydrq,,"Discarded femurs and ribcages intertwined until they reached a point resembling stability. I stood slowly, moving with careful steps across the shifting floor.",23,64
1pzydrq,,"A rogue vertebra sent my feet flying out from under me, and I braced for the pain as my face careened toward the jagged surface.",25,65
1pzydrq,,"Instead of hard bone, I was met with the warmth of living tissue.",13,66
1pzydrq,,"Fresh, wet blood coated my cheek as I pulled away from the corpse of the father deer I had seen.",20,67
1pzydrq,,"I scrambled against the wall, struggling to keep my footing as the bones slid effortlessly across each other.",18,68
1pzydrq,,My knuckles crashed against abandoned skulls and hooves as I slipped cartoonishly in the stinking darkness.,16,69
1pzydrq,,"I stared in raw, stunned terror as a tinkling rumble sounded from somewhere deep within the heap of rot; a harbinger of things unknown gliding though a sea of death.",30,70
1pzydrq,,"The ripple closed the space between us, sliding in seconds through fifteen feet of near-solid bone matrices. It stopped at my feet, and for a moment all was still.",29,71
1pzydrq,,"Then a rattling shuffle began from below the surface. I listened as whatever it was grew closer, shivers of fear racking my body.",23,72
1pzydrq,,"I was shaking so violently that the bones had begun to displace themselves around me, leading me to sink slightly down into the pile.",24,73
1pzydrq,,"A rotted hand, all horrid blacks and greens with glimmers of stark white below, burst forth—and then another.",18,74
1pzydrq,,"Slowly, inexorably, the being extracted itself from the tangled mass of putrid, discarded flesh. Decaying viscera lay draped across his exposed skull.",22,75
1pzydrq,,"All the meat above his upper lip had been eaten away. His ears pustulous craters, writhing with life as the insects living within him fled from his ear canal.",29,76
1pzydrq,,"The blackness of his empty eye sockets suddenly parted at their midline, as if phantom eyelids had opened to reveal the bloodshot, emerald eyes of Heinrich Einsam.",27,77
1pzydrq,,"Heinrich finished extruding his torso from within the pile. I wished desperately for my body to stop quaking. I wanted to disappear, to become as close to invisible as possible.",30,78
1pzydrq,,"He turned his gaze to me, his skull rolling limply to the side as he fixed me with a single, blazing green eye.",23,79
1pzydrq,,"""Hey,"" His voice was a wet rasp, as if he were speaking through a wasp's nest soaked in viscera, ""I found someone. Be–neath the bones.",25,80
1pzydrq,,"You sh—ould see her."" 

As he finished the sentence he tried again to turn both eyes to me, leading his head to rotate around to the other side, his jaw hanging uselessly from weak, dry tendons mummified by decay.",39,81
1pzydrq,,"His torso was a writhing mess of maggots, with botfly larva dotting his shoulders from end to end.",18,82
1pzydrq,,His chest pulsed loudly with each ragged breath as the pungent air disturbed the insects nested in his lungs.,19,83
1pzydrq,,"Chittering sounds echoed through the chasm as Heinrich brought himself to loom over me. The foul odor of rot overpowering as he seeped decomposition across my chest. ""Come with me.",30,84
1pzydrq,,Be–low the bones.,3,85
1pzydrq,,"You have a ho—me here."" 

I lashed out with my boot, caving in a large section of his decrepit ribcage and setting swarms of insects to buzz through the closed space.",31,86
1pzydrq,,"I moved as quickly as I could to create distance, but it was impossible to keep track of him in the endless, buzzing storm.",24,87
1pzydrq,,"I could feel a million legs crawling across my skin, and I had to swat uselessly at the air to keep them from my eyes.",25,88
1pzydrq,,"I retched as a fly crawled briefly into one of my nostrils, imparting the stench of rot it carried.",19,89
1pzydrq,,Heinrich let out a cry of terrible rage; causing another uproar of tiny wings within his chest.,17,90
1pzydrq,,The way his agony warbled and wove itself through the wrathful echo of his keening wail caused my head to thrum with horrible pressure.,24,91
1pzydrq,,I clapped my hands to my ears and scanned desperately for any possible way to get out.,17,92
1pzydrq,,"On the far side, near where I had fallen through, there was a ladder leading up to a small hatch.",20,93
1pzydrq,,"My clumsy, panicked feet betrayed me as I moved for the ladder, leaving me sprawled out on the shifting floor.",20,94

1pzydrq,,You be–long to her now. Nothing of Her sees the sky.,11,96
1pzydrq,,"You go be—low."" 

His voice stretched wildly between rage and reverence, filtering through meters of dessicated bone and echoing off the walls of the pit.",25,97
1pzydrq,,"He slid effortlessly through the bones, and I could hear the shifting rattle behind me as he breached the surface.",20,98
1pzydrq,,"He wobbled slightly, as if maintaining balance were a constant effort. His half-devoured skull lolling uselessly from side to side as he swayed.",23,99
1pzydrq,,"I scrambled like an animal, raking discarded femurs and abandoned forelimbs back past my head as I crawled desperately toward the ladder; shards scraping my face as they flew.",29,100
1pzydrq,,"He slammed down, splintering the tips of his fingers into tiny shards. He had fallen short. I didn't waste my chance. Wrenching myself upright, I ran for the exit.",29,101
1pzydrq,,"My heart dropped as the wet wood flexed beneath my weight. I made it up one rung, and then another, before a searing pain tore through my leg.",28,102
1pzydrq,,"From where he had fallen, Heinrich had dragged himself across the room.",12,103
1pzydrq,,"A chain of deer thoraxes lay behind him, a sinewous rope of shadowy darkness chaining them each to Heinrich's writhing form.",21,104
1pzydrq,,"He had dragged himself up and shoved his devastated fingers through my calf, in behind my shin. I panicked and tried to pull the leg away.",26,105
1pzydrq,,The pain brought white hot oblivion bleeding into the edges of my vision as my head swam.,17,106
1pzydrq,,"The muscles binding my calf to my shin stretching themselves against Heinrich's fingers, threatening to shear away completely.",18,107
1pzydrq,,"Hot, yellow bile rolled from my throat as the pain threatened to drive me to unconsciousness.",16,108
1pzydrq,,"I was dragged back to reality by the feeling of a splinter slowly piercing my right thumb. The hand had fallen away from the ladder, dangling down behind me.",29,109
1pzydrq,,"There beyond the tips of my fingers, I could see the gleam of terrible, hungry malice suspended in that cloying, fetid air.",22,110
1pzydrq,,"He used the fingers planted in my leg for support, sending waves of brutal agony tearing through me.",18,111
1pzydrq,,"He stretched and writhed until he had positioned each of his jaws around my index, middle, and ring fingers. He chomped down, shearing each finger at the knuckle.",28,112
1pzydrq,,"I sucked the foul air into my lungs as he raised himself up for more, and then there was a horrible tearing sound.",23,113
1pzydrq,,The weight of his form had been too much for his dessicated tendons to hold. His wrist had come unbound from his arm.,23,114
1pzydrq,,The sudden shift in weight was too much for his tentative sense of balance.,14,115
1pzydrq,,"He toppled to the ground, casting bone and viscera across the room in a wide arc as he fell.",19,116
1pzydrq,,"I cried in desperation as I willed my battered body to climb. One rung, two more, and I had reached the hatch.",22,117

Twice. ""I didn't want to go. Not at first. But she has shown me things. She will show you as well."" 

Thrice.",30,119
1pzydrq,,"He clamped his jaws around the rubber of my boot. I yanked wildly, sending teeth careening from around the pit as my shoulder slammed against the hatch.",27,120
1pzydrq,,"Sunlight burst in, illuminating Heinrich's infested, decaying form tumbling down into the pit. I scrambled out into the afternoon air.",20,121

""Why hello to you, too!""

He approached me with janky steps, and the security followed him.",17,25
1pzvwyy,,"He extended his hand, and it was a sea of wrinkles and spots, but I took it anyway. His grip was stronger than I expected.",25,26
1pzvwyy,,"He pulled me in close,

""My name is William Wyrm, boy! This is one beautiful Church you got here!""

""Thanks, I help maintain it.",24,27
1pzvwyy,,"If you want people to come, you gotta make it look pretty.""

""That's right!""

He cleared his throat and straightened himself.",21,28
1pzvwyy,,"His tone got slightly more serious as he asked,

""Is the Pastor here at this time?""

""Unfortunately, he's out right now, but I can give him your number if you want.""

He grabbed a card from his shirt pocket; there was only the symbol of a golden cross on one side and his number on the back.",57,29
1pzvwyy,,"After he gave it to me, he looked at our Church again and sighed.",14,30

""I think we're celebrating 125 years this Easter, I believe.""

He turned to me and smiled, his stretched face working against his expression.",27,32
1pzvwyy,,"He nodded and then asked,

""What's the inside like?",9,33

I had this dark feeling in my gut; it wasn't just his appearance, but there was a menace behind his words that I couldn't describe.",30,34
1pzvwyy,,"I wanted to tell him 'no' so badly, but who was I to turn down this man? So I let him and his men in to look around.",28,35
1pzvwyy,,"He looked at the floors and ceiling of our sanctuary, which was plain but elegant in its simplicity. It was made for endurance, not decadence.",25,36
1pzvwyy,,"""What woods is this, boy?"" He spat,

""American chestnut, I believe.""

""A lot of the older ones usually are."" He mumbled,

I asked, ""Say again?""

""Oh, I was just saying it's a very fine wood.",35,37
1pzvwyy,,"Shame they don't make them anymore.""

""...Sure.""

""Well, I've seen all I wanted. I guess I'll linger until Sunday.",19,38

And then he was gone, drove back to whatever hotel he was renting nearby, and I didn't see him again until Sunday morning.",28,39
1pzvwyy,,"I gave our Pastor his card, and he said he'd look into it another time.",15,40
1pzvwyy,,"That Sunday, I saw him sitting in the back pews; he was the first to enter the Church.",18,41
1pzvwyy,,"As our regulars walked in, they were met with a scowling stare from the man in the back.",18,42
1pzvwyy,,"Behind his eyes were malice and judgment, all without saying a single word. Once everyone was in, Church began, songs were sung, and the lesson was taught.",27,43
1pzvwyy,,"Everyone talked afterwards to each other, but Wyrm just sat back there, just watching, and waiting for everyone to clear out.",21,44
1pzvwyy,,"I didn't like him, but I couldn't say that in a Church; this was a place to welcome, not to expel. Yet, maybe it was best if I had.",29,45
1pzvwyy,,"Once the last person was out, our Pastor, let's call him Ted, for the sake of anonymity, walked to the back and talked with Wyrm.",25,46
1pzvwyy,,"And for the first time all morning, he smiled and flashed his grotesquely fake grin.",15,47
1pzvwyy,,"Ted had said,

""Jimmy tells me that you was here to talk with me, is that right?""

""Oh yes, son, it's just a little proposition.",25,48
1pzvwyy,,"May we talk in your office?""

He hesitated, but steadied himself with a professional demeanor,

""Of course.",17,49
1pzvwyy,,"Need me to fix anything to drink?""

""I'll just have tea, thank you.""

Now, one of my biggest sins is that I'm nosey, I get into people's business, and I gossip, but perhaps it was an unintentional blessing considering how things turned out.",43,50
1pzvwyy,,"The security system we installed has only a few cameras around the Church, and there was one installed in Ted's office.",21,51
1pzvwyy,,"I can access them on my laptop, so I went into the Men's bathroom and put in my earphones to listen to the conversation.",24,52
1pzvwyy,,"It started out harmless, chatting about the Church's history and about how pretty it stayed after all these years. Then the conversation turned to theology, and it turned ugly.",29,53
1pzvwyy,,"Wyrm and Ted traded blows with scripture. Ted was for the inclusion and brotherhood of Christ, while Wyrm said that he polluted the blood of 'God's Army'.",27,54
1pzvwyy,,"This went on for so long that I almost thought of shutting down the laptop and calling it a day, but then, out of the blue, Wyrm says,

""You've got a small flock, Ted, are you gonna pander to the select few sinners who don't change their nature?",48,55
1pzvwyy,,"These vile demons that infest our faith with their so-called progressive ways? You're not saving them, you're enabling them.",19,56
1pzvwyy,,"Cast them out, and a new flock will come.""

I thought Ted, the strong man of faith I knew, would shut this shit down and tell him to leave, but he just sat there.",34,57
1pzvwyy,,"Looking defeated and staring into his cup of tea. He mumbled out,

""I try. I try to turn the other cheek.""

""That time is over!",25,58
1pzvwyy,,That weak passage has enabled so many to take advantage of our faith.,13,59
1pzvwyy,,"I'll tell you what we need...""

He balled up his old, wrinkled hand into a white knuckled fist,

""This!",19,60
1pzvwyy,,"This is the only thing that folks listen to now!""

""I'm not a violent man.""

""Niether am I! But these sheep? Our flock? They can be.",26,61
1pzvwyy,,All you have to do is play dumb when they go a little too far every now and then.,19,62
1pzvwyy,,"But they work our will regardless.""

""What should I do?""

Wyrm laid a hand on Ted's shoulder; his back was to the camera, but I could feel his smile.",29,63
1pzvwyy,,"""I can transform this place into the battleground we need. Give you power, *true* power, Ted. Imagine it!",18,64
1pzvwyy,,"Rows and rows of seats, giant speakers blasting your voice directly into their souls, and everything you need at your disposal.",21,65
1pzvwyy,,"Everything and anything you'd *want*.""

Ted looked up with fascinated eyes; they were wet with tears. ""What do I need to do?""

""Nothing special.",24,66
1pzvwyy,,"You just need to pledge loyalty to my company, and we'll get started immediately.""

""How?""

Wyrm stood to his feet, extended a hand to shake, and grumbled,

""Just a handshake, no contracts or legal agreements, just a good old-fashioned handshake.",40,67
1pzvwyy,,"What do you say?""

Ted arose to his feet and looked at the haggard old hand, the nails jutting out a little too long.",24,68
1pzvwyy,,"But regardless of the warning signs, after the verbal and theological beating he took, Ted betrayed his own faith with a simple handshake.",23,69
1pzvwyy,,"I could hear a low chittering sound, and was disgusted to find out that this was how Wyrm laughed.",19,70
1pzvwyy,,"The sound made my skin crawl, and my stomach turn, but that was nothing compared to what happened next.",19,71
1pzvwyy,,"Wyrm gave Ted his cup and said,

""Go get us more tea, son.",13,72
1pzvwyy,,"We've got arrangements to make, and I can't talk with my throat all dry like this.""

Ted exited the room, and that's when Wyrm turned to face the camera.",29,73
1pzvwyy,,"He locked eyes with it, and there was something different about him now. His eyes were those of a goat, slanted pupils with yellowed irises.",25,74
1pzvwyy,,"He smiled to the camera, held the hand that he used to shake Ted's, and licked his palm with a satisfied moan.",22,75
1pzvwyy,,"My heart froze, and it felt like every vein in my body was full of ice. Out of instinct, I slammed the laptop shut and bolted from the Church.",29,76
1pzvwyy,,"I didn't hear from Ted all week; there wasn't even a Wednesday service that week, and for a moment, I had hope that what I'd witnessed was nothing more than a fever dream or perhaps an intense psychological break.",39,77
1pzvwyy,,"But that Sunday, I was reminded all too much that what I witnessed was real. Within the Church, there were cameras set up all around the sanctuary.",27,78
1pzvwyy,,Men worked to get their shots lined up and tested the audio as folks strolled in for what they thought was going to be a regular service.,27,79
1pzvwyy,,"We didn't see Ted until he approached the pulpit, and his appearance had undergone a change in such a short time. His hair was styled and greased with hair gel.",30,80
1pzvwyy,,"His teeth were bleached so white that they looked alien, and for the first time in his ministry, he traded his plain Sunday clothing for a lavish two-piece suit with golden cufflinks.",32,81
1pzvwyy,,"""I've got a lot to get off my chest this morning...""

He unleashed a tidal wave of hatred, racism, homophobia, sexism, transphobia, and many other obscenities on those in attendance.",30,82
1pzvwyy,,"He laid out his biblical plan, his reinvention of how to perfect and purify his Church. *His* Church.",18,83
1pzvwyy,,"With every person who walked out, every person who was shunned from God's house, Ted took this as a grand spiritual victory.",22,84
1pzvwyy,,"With every venomous word he spewed, the regulars who'd called this Church home dispersed in silence until there was just me.",21,85
1pzvwyy,,"After he finished his sermon, he called to me, asking if I'd like to confess to Christ and accept him, but I said,

""I was already saved here, Ted.""

""But that was the Church of old,"" he said, ""The Church of Sinners and Cowards!""

""Cowards?"" I said, approaching him, ""I'll tell you something about cowards.",55,86
1pzvwyy,,"A true man of faith doesn't sell out his beliefs for power.""

I was face-to-face with him, and I didn't recognize him anymore.",23,87
1pzvwyy,,This was not the kind-hearted preacher who'd given sermons on kindness and love. I saw a man with manic hatred and lust for power.,24,88
1pzvwyy,,"I leaned in and whispered the last words I'd ever say to him,

""You're a fucking coward.""

Ted was flabergasted at my words at first, but as I left, I heard him spin this towards his narrative, and said,

""It is finished!",42,89
1pzvwyy,,"This Church, for the first time in decades, is cleansed!""

In the following days, I'd be fired as caretaker of the Church, and that following Sunday, I saw crowds flock to the Church in droves.",35,90

1pzv7mh,,"I stood there with the door open behind me, keys still in my hand, feeling like I’d just let something in because it knew where to sit.",27,30
1pzv7mh,,I did practical things because practical things feel like armor. Water bowl. Food. Check him for injuries. Look under his belly. Check the pads of his feet. Look for burrs.,30,31
1pzv7mh,,"Look for blood. Nothing. No cuts. No torn nails. No limping. He ate, but slow. Careful. Like he was concentrating on chewing.",22,32
1pzv7mh,,"Between bites, his gaze snapped to the corners of the room. Not random.",13,33
1pzv7mh,,"The same ones, in a pattern that made no sense unless he was tracking something I couldn’t see. Corner behind the TV. Corner by the bathroom door.",27,34
1pzv7mh,,"Shadow under the end table. I put a spare collar on him, the cheap nylon one with a plastic buckle. He let me. He didn’t help. He didn’t resist.",29,35
1pzv7mh,,He just watched my face the whole time like he was studying what expression goes where. That night I tried to act normal.,23,36
1pzv7mh,,I ate a microwaved skillet meal off a paper plate.,10,37
1pzv7mh,,"I drank one beer too fast, a can of Coors Light I’d left in the fridge from last trip, because my hands wouldn’t stop doing that small tremor thing they do when you’re trying to pretend you’re fine.",38,38
1pzv7mh,,"Buck sat in the living room facing the hallway. Not sleeping. Not begging. Just watching. When I went to bed, I left the bedroom door open like usual.",28,39
1pzv7mh,,"He followed me in and went to the far corner by my duffel bag. And he sat, facing the bed. I told myself he was anxious.",26,40
1pzv7mh,,That he’d been trapped somewhere. That he needed to see me. That dogs do weird things after trauma. I turned off the lamp. At some point I fell asleep.,29,41
1pzv7mh,,Then I woke up like my body had been yanked out of it. Not gradually. Not that normal half-awake roll. I snapped awake with my heart already going.,28,42
1pzv7mh,,My phone was on the nightstand. The screen lit when I brushed it. 2:00 a.m. exactly. Buck was still in the corner. Sitting straight.,24,43
1pzv7mh,,Staring at me like he’d been doing it for hours. I swallowed. The sound felt loud in the quiet.,19,44
1pzv7mh,,"His head tilted a fraction, like he was listening to my throat. “Buck,” I whispered. His mouth opened slightly. Not panting. Not relaxed. Just open enough to show teeth.",29,45
1pzv7mh,,"He made a sound that wasn’t a bark. It was wet and low, like someone pushing air through a throat that didn’t know what shape to make.",27,46
1pzv7mh,,It came in pulses that made my brain do the dumbest thing possible. It tried to make it into syllables. He stood and walked toward the bed.,27,47
1pzv7mh,,"His steps were careful, placed, like he was thinking about where to put each paw. He stopped close enough that the stagnant-water smell hit me harder.",26,48
1pzv7mh,,"He made the sound again, inches from my face.",9,49
1pzv7mh,,I grabbed my flashlight off the dresser and clicked it on because that’s what you do when your brain is screaming at you. Light equals control.,26,50
1pzv7mh,,The beam hit his eyes. He didn’t flinch. He didn’t squint. He didn’t do that normal pupil-tightening thing. Maybe it was the angle.,23,51
1pzv7mh,,Maybe my hands were shaking and I didn’t see it right. I’m not telling you I’m a scientist in a lab.,21,52
1pzv7mh,,"I’m telling you what it felt like in that moment, and in that moment it felt like light meant nothing to him. “Stop,” I said, and my voice cracked.",29,53
1pzv7mh,,"“Stop doing that.”

He turned his head toward the bedroom door like he’d heard something outside. I listened. Nothing. No branches. No wind. Just my breathing.",26,54
1pzv7mh,,"He looked back at me and sat down again in the corner, like the whole thing was done. I didn’t sleep after that.",23,55
1pzv7mh,,I sat upright with the flashlight in my lap until my eyes felt gritty and my jaw hurt from clenching.,20,56
1pzv7mh,,"In the morning, the cabin looked normal in that cruel way daylight does. Sun through the dusty window. Stove cold. My own mess on the counter.",26,57
1pzv7mh,,"Buck sat by the wood stove, staring into the corner where wall met floor. I tried to call the vet in town. No service.",24,58
1pzv7mh,,"One bar that turned into zero as soon as I hit “call.” I walked outside to the one spot near the split pine where I sometimes get a signal, held my phone up over my head like it was 2006.",40,59
1pzv7mh,,"Nothing. All day he stared into corners like he was waiting for something to move there. That night, I told myself I needed a barrier. Not to punish him.",29,60
1pzv7mh,,To get one full night where I wasn’t waking up to him watching me like a stranger. I shut him out of the bedroom and locked the door.,28,61
1pzv7mh,,"It’s one of those cheap twist locks, more for privacy than security.",12,62
1pzv7mh,,"I pushed a chair against it too, which is the kind of thing you do when you know you’re being ridiculous but you do it anyway.",26,63
1pzv7mh,,"At first, he whined like a normal dog. That hit me right in the chest, because Buck’s whine has always been pathetic in a way that works.",27,64
1pzv7mh,,"I almost opened the door. Then the whining changed. It got higher, more controlled. Like someone aiming for “sad dog” and overshooting it. No scratching. No paw scrapes.",28,65
1pzv7mh,,"Just that steady crying sound on the other side like it was being performed. I sat on the bed staring at the door, waiting for my brain to calm down.",30,66
1pzv7mh,,Then I heard something under the whining. Softer. Wet. Breath pushed close to the crack. And I heard something that made my whole body go cold.,26,67
1pzv7mh,,"“Let… me… in.”

I held my breath so hard my chest started to hurt. It came again, clearer. “Let me in.”

I grabbed my phone and hit record.",28,68
1pzv7mh,,My hand shook so badly the screen blurred. I held it near the crack under the door like that would make reality show up in the audio.,27,69
1pzv7mh,,"Later, in daylight, the recording was just muffled whining and a couple dull bumps. No clean words. Nothing I could point at and say, hear it, I’m not imagining things.",30,70
1pzv7mh,,"In the moment, I heard it. The whining stopped. Silence. Then the doorknob rattled. Not a paw slipping on metal. A rattle like something was testing it.",27,71
1pzv7mh,,The knob turned down and sprang back up. The lock held. I didn’t move until the sun came up.,19,72
1pzv7mh,,"The next morning, Buck was in the living room by the window, watching the tree line like he’d been there all night. He turned his head toward me slowly.",29,73
1pzv7mh,,His mouth opened slightly. No sound. Just that same wrong stillness. That was the day I should have left.,19,74
1pzv7mh,,"Instead, I did what people do when something is wrong and they don’t want to admit it. I tried to make it normal. I cleaned. I kept busy.",28,75
1pzv7mh,,I avoided looking at him too long. I told myself I was hearing words in whining because I was tired and scared and my brain wanted a pattern.,28,76
1pzv7mh,,"Late afternoon, I walked into the kitchen and caught him briefly up against the wall near the cabinet, on his hind legs like he’d been reaching for something.",28,77
1pzv7mh,,"The moment I made a noise, he dropped down. He looked at me like I’d interrupted him.",17,78
1pzv7mh,,"That night I sat on the couch with the TV on low and my phone in my hand, telling myself I’d stay awake.",23,79
1pzv7mh,,"I told myself I’d keep him in sight. I told myself I was done being stupid. At some point, my eyes closed anyway.",23,80
1pzv7mh,,I woke to a slam that made the whole cabin shudder. Not from outside. From inside. My bedroom door. Another slam. Harder. The wood groaned. Then Buck screamed. Not barking.,30,81
1pzv7mh,,"Not yelping. A raw, dragged-out scream that didn’t sound like it belonged in a dog’s throat.",16,82
1pzv7mh,,"And inside it, mixed through it, my brain caught a shape that it couldn’t unhear.",15,83
1pzv7mh,,"“LET ME IN!”

I stood up so fast I smacked my shin on the coffee table and barely felt it. Buck wasn’t in the living room.",26,84
1pzv7mh,,"He wasn’t on the rug. The screaming came again from the hall. “LET ME IN!”

The bedroom door shook like something was throwing its whole weight into it.",28,85
1pzv7mh,,"I ran down the hall barefoot, stupid, unarmed. My brain kept trying to hand me explanations that fit. Intruder. Bear. Anything. The doorknob rattled. Then it went down.",28,86
1pzv7mh,,"All the way down. It lifted back up. Then went down again. Deliberate. The door hit again, and this time the hinge side cracked. I heard wood split.",28,87
1pzv7mh,,"The frame flexed. I backed up and grabbed the first thing my hand found in the kitchen, the cast-iron skillet because it was heavy and because heavy feels like safety.",30,88
1pzv7mh,,The door bulged inward. A shape pushed through the widening crack.,11,89
1pzv7mh,,"At first I saw fur and my brain tried to snap it into “Buck.”

Then I saw the paw was wrong. Longer. Toes stretched.",24,90
1pzv7mh,,Pads looking like skin pulled tight over a structure that didn’t match. Nails thick and dark and curved like hooks. It hooked into the wood. Pulled.,26,91
1pzv7mh,,"The door opened more, not forced open, but peeled open like the frame was soft. And Buck stepped through. For one heartbeat, he looked like Buck. Brown coat. Crooked ear.",30,92
1pzv7mh,,That face. Then he straightened up. He rose onto his hind legs like a person standing. Too tall. The front limbs lifted and the joints bent in the wrong places.,30,93
1pzv7mh,,"The paws split and lengthened into crude hand-shapes, fingers stretching too long, nails hardening into razor-bright claws that caught the hall light. I know how that sounds. I know.",29,94
1pzv7mh,,"If I was reading this, I’d be rolling my eyes at myself. I’m telling you what was in front of me. His head tilted. His mouth opened too wide.",29,95
1pzv7mh,,"The corners pulled like the skin didn’t want to go there. And that wet forced voice sound came out again, clearer than it should have been.",26,96
1pzv7mh,,"“Let… me… in.”

I swung the skillet. It leaned aside too fast, like it knew what a swing was. The skillet hit the wall and rang through my arms.",29,97
1pzv7mh,,"The claws shot forward. Not paws. Hands. It grabbed my forearm and I felt the hooks bite and drag. Heat, then pain so sharp my vision whitened.",27,98
1pzv7mh,,"I screamed and yanked back, and it hauled me forward like I weighed nothing. My heel caught the runner and I went down hard, shoulder slamming the boards.",28,99
1pzv7mh,,"The skillet skittered away. It stepped closer, still on two legs. The floor creaked under it in a way Buck never did, deeper, heavier. It reached toward my face.",29,100
1pzv7mh,,"I threw my legs up and kicked at its knee joint. My heel connected and it wobbled, and that wobble bought me a second.",24,101
1pzv7mh,,"I scrambled backward on my elbows toward the kitchen, my injured arm screaming. Blood slicked my skin and made everything feel unreal. It caught my calf. Claws sank in deep.",30,102
1pzv7mh,,I felt something scrape hard under the skin and I made a sound I didn’t recognize as my own. I twisted and grabbed blindly for the skillet.,27,103
1pzv7mh,,My fingers hit the handle and I swung backward without looking. Metal hit something solid. It made a noise that wasn’t pain exactly. More like irritation.,26,104
1pzv7mh,,Like the wrong sound coming out of the wrong throat. The grip loosened.,13,105
1pzv7mh,,"I got to my feet and slammed into the front door, yanked it open, and fell out onto the porch.",20,106
1pzv7mh,,My palms tore on the rough boards and I didn’t care. Cold air hit me like a slap.,18,107
1pzv7mh,,"Behind me, inside the cabin, it screamed again and the words inside it were clearer now, louder, angrier.",18,108
1pzv7mh,,"“LET ME IN!”

Like the cabin was the thing it wanted, not me. I limped off the porch and half-fell down the steps. Gravel chewed into my palms.",28,109
1pzv7mh,,My sock went warm with blood. I got to my truck and fumbled the keys so badly I dropped them twice.,21,110
1pzv7mh,,The interior light came on and I saw blood smeared across my forearm like I’d been painting. I started the engine and threw it in reverse. Tires spit gravel.,29,111
1pzv7mh,,"As I backed out, the porch light caught movement. It was in the doorway. Standing there on two legs, half in shadow.",22,112
1pzv7mh,,"Its front limbs hung in that wrong way, hands flexing, claws testing air. It tilted its head and watched me.",20,113
1pzv7mh,,"Then it lifted one of those hands and tapped the door frame twice, slow. A knock. I didn’t hear a clean sentence over my engine.",25,114
1pzv7mh,,I heard a soft wet shape of sound that my brain insists it understood anyway.,15,115
1pzv7mh,,"Something like: “c’m… back.”

I drove until I hit pavement and my hands started cramping on the steering wheel.",19,116
1pzv7mh,,I kept checking the mirror like I expected to see something running behind my truck on two legs. I ended up at a small emergency room about an hour out.,30,117
1pzv7mh,,Fluorescent lights. That burnt coffee smell near the waiting area.,10,118
1pzv7mh,,The triage nurse stuck a paper wristband on me and it pulled at my arm hair when she pressed it down. She asked what happened.,25,119
1pzv7mh,,"I said, “Animal attack.”

She looked at my calf and my forearm and did not believe I was giving her the whole story, but she also didn’t push like she’d pushed before with drunks and fights.",36,120
1pzv7mh,,She just nodded and went to get someone. They cleaned my arm. Stitched my calf. Wrapped both.,17,121
1pzv7mh,,Gave me antibiotics and a tetanus shot that made my shoulder ache for two days. A doctor asked if it was a dog.,23,122
1pzv7mh,,"I said, “I don’t know.”

That’s the most honest answer I had. The next morning, I went back with a deputy. He didn’t say much on the drive.",28,123
1pzv7mh,,Just kept his eyes on the road like he was hoping I’d talk myself into a normal explanation by hearing my own voice.,23,124
1pzv7mh,,"Daylight made the cabin look almost normal from the outside, which made me feel worse. Like the night had been a dream I was dragging into the sun.",28,125
1pzv7mh,,"Inside, it wasn’t a dream. The bedroom door was splintered and half off its frame.",15,126
1pzv7mh,,"There were gouges in the hallway wall at shoulder height, deep raked lines like someone had dragged metal down drywall. There was blood on the runner. Mine.",27,127
1pzv7mh,,"On the living room rug, near where Buck used to sleep, was Buck’s original collar with his tags still attached. Clean. Like it had been washed.",26,128
1pzv7mh,,The deputy picked it up with two fingers and looked at me like he wanted this to fit into a report. “Where’s the dog now?” he asked.,27,129
1pzv7mh,,"I stared at the open hallway and felt my stomach twist in that slow nauseous way fear has when it’s done sprinting. “I don’t know,” I said. That’s the truth.",30,130
1pzv7mh,,I never saw Buck again. I sold the cabin a month later. Took a loss. Didn’t argue. I just wanted distance. But distance doesn’t fix what you think it fixes.,30,131
1pzv7mh,,"Because now I’m in my apartment with streetlights and neighbors and traffic noise, and some nights I still wake up without knowing why. I check my phone. 2:00 a.m. Exactly.",30,132
1pzv7mh,,"And I lie there staring at the corner of my bedroom where the wall meets the floor, because I swear that corner looks darker than it should.",27,133
1pzv7mh,,Sometimes I hear a soft rattle from the door handle. Just once. Like someone testing it.,16,134
1pzv7mh,,Like something that learned how doors work is waiting for the night I forget to lock one.,17,135

“Thank you.”

1pzts0s,,"“No, not anymore.”

“I’m sorry to hear that.”

John tightened his lips and nodded. His beautiful small dog then came into the room. He quickly shifted the conversation to him.",30,5
1pzts0s,,"We continued talking for another 15 minutes, then John excused himself.",11,6
1pzts0s,,"Over the next few weeks, I saw him almost every day after work, coming into the building with his dog.",20,7

1pzts0s,,"Being away from my family and friends was unpleasant, but his presence and the conversations we had made it easier.",20,9
1pzts0s,,"His personality was warm and kind, and he made me feel safe. Plus, I loved his little cute dog. One day, I was back on my way from work.",29,10
1pzts0s,,"I saw him coming into the building, but he didn’t have his dog today. He waved at me and held the door as I came in.",26,11

1pzts0s,,"“Still thinking of Jenny, huh?”

“How do you know her name?”

“You told me before.”

“Oh, okay.”

“Well, I got something to cheer you up.”

“Have you been to the 7th floor before?” he said as we got on the elevator.",41,13
1pzts0s,,"“No, Denis said it’s blocked off.”

“Yes, for tenants, but not for apartment owners. I have some stuff stored up there.",21,14
1pzts0s,,"You wanna take a look?”

“Sure.”

John pressed the button. The elevator rattled and began going up. First, second, third floor. “Our floor,” John said jokingly and winked.",28,15
1pzts0s,,"Six, seventh floor. The elevator stopped. A ding. The door didn’t open. I stared at the door, not blinking, waiting. Nothing. A chill ran down my spine.",27,16
1pzts0s,,"“Um….John?”

He was looking at the door with contempt. His eyes were glowing red. Then the elevator started shaking violently. Blood froze in my veins.",25,17
1pzts0s,,"I had to grab onto the bar. “Jesus.”

John stood still. Then the shaking stopped. The door opened. A dark, cold, and empty hallway.",24,18

1pzts0s,,"“What was that, John?”

“No one really goes up here; it makes it rattle a little.”

“A little?”

“Everything okay?”

He put his hand on my shoulder.",27,20
1pzts0s,,"I let out a loud sigh. “Yeah.”

“Okay,” he said and smiled. John then walked over to the wall and pressed the switch. It flickered in a dim yellow light.",30,21
1pzts0s,,"The walls were grey with large pieces of plaster peeling off. A moldy, damp odor reeked. The hall went on and then split in two directions at the wall.",29,22

John walked swiftly, faster than I had ever seen him before.",30,23

“Wait.”

Another turn. A hall much longer than the others. Rooms with steel bars. “Here,” he had a strange, cunning smile.",27,25

1pzts0s,,"In another, there was a children’s car seat. John was at his storage unit looking through his pockets.",18,27
1pzts0s,,"When he saw me come over, his face twisted in an unnatural, wide grin. My heart dropped when I walked closer to him. In the unit was a half-broken car.",30,28

He was now standing next to it, smiling.",21,29

“What’s happening, John?”

“You tell me. Why did you lie to the police?",20,30
1pzts0s,,"Why did you say you didn’t drink that night?”

The car started burning. The smell of burned fuel filled the room.",21,31
1pzts0s,,"I jumped back and tried to get away, but the hall to the left was only a wall.",18,32

1pzqabq,,"Not because I was scared of him, because I knew what would happen if I didn’t wave.",17,18
1pzqabq,,"For weeks, I cried myself every night to sleep, until they finally gave in, just a little.",17,19
1pzqabq,,"The curtain could stay open, I could stand on the floor, I could wave once, quickly. The tapping stopped. Eventually, it stopped coming altogether. I grew up, we moved house.",30,20

1pzqabq,,"Mostly ordinary stuff, holidays, birthdays, mainly junk people keep to remind them of a similar time. Then I saw one taken from my bedroom, nighttime.",25,24
1pzqabq,,"The flash caught the glass mid-reflection, behind my small hand pressed against the window, something stood in the garden. Closer than I remembered, Its hand was raised.",27,25
1pzqabq,,"Not waving, touching the glass from the other side. My dad went quiet when he saw it, he didn’t laugh this time.",22,26
1pzqabq,,"“We thought,” he said slowly, “that if we played along… if we let you wave… it wouldn’t try to come inside.”

I asked him why they never told me, he looked at me for a long moment.",37,27
1pzqabq,,"“Because,” he said, “whatever it was… it stopped coming after you grew out of the habit.”

That night, for the first time in decades, I dreamed of my childhood window.",30,28
1pzqabq,,"I was standing on the floor, just like they’d made me. Outside, beyond the glass, something waited patiently. Its hand was raised, not practicing anymore.",25,29

“Connor! I’m so glad you’re okay.” He gripped me in for a strong and long hug, which took all the air from my lungs.",25,6
1pzp7rs,,"When he released me, he looked down deeply at me and smiled, hands firm on my shoulders.",17,7
1pzp7rs,,"​

“Hey Dad, thanks,” I paused and felt my face wrinkle, unable to contain my thoughts for even a moment.",20,8
1pzp7rs,,"“In the woods, did you see anything?” I asked, staring right up at him. ​

“No, no, I didn’t.",19,9
1pzp7rs,,"But I’ll be going out there later tonight to find whatever did that to you. Do you remember what it was?”

​

”No! You can’t go back out there.",29,10
1pzp7rs,,"Something is really wrong out there!” My dad shook his head in disbelief. ​

”What are you talking about, Connor? What the hell was it?”

​

”I don’t know.",29,11
1pzp7rs,,It was evil. Just please don’t go back.” I shuddered thinking of the wolf and its appearance in my dream.,20,12

1pzp7rs,,"For a moment, I began to feel at peace until a dreaded whisper came to me. ​

“Huc Puer”

I leaped out of my bed and looked around wide-eyed.",30,19
1pzp7rs,,"​

“Who the hell said that? Where are you?” I whispered, for some reason feeling it necessary not to alert my parents.",22,20
1pzp7rs,,"​

“Huc… Puer.” Again, the rasp came, and I looked to the floor. It was coming from under the bed.",20,21
1pzp7rs,,"Slowly, I bent over, preparing myself for what I was about to come face to face with. I jolted down and saw nothing.",23,22
1pzp7rs,,"For a moment, I stared under the mess that was my bed and felt a vast relief come over me until I lifted my head up slightly, and a flash of terror went through me.",35,23
1pzp7rs,,"Lunging back, I scrambled for a semblance of control over my limbs. That fiendish face already stared at me from my bed.",22,24
1pzp7rs,,"The Jack-O-Lantern grinned and flashed again before talking further. ​

”Boy… come here, please,” it said and rocked back and forth.",21,25
1pzp7rs,,"I backed up further and clutched the ground to feel any type of support as my mind disassociated. ​

”What… What are you?” I asked, trembling.",26,26
1pzp7rs,,"For a moment, it just grinned at me, still before speaking in that same rasp. ​

”You are in grave danger, boy.",22,27
1pzp7rs,,"You did well having the intuition to give me a mouth to speak with, but soon my warnings will do you no good.” I stood, back pressed firmly against the wall, before speaking.",33,28
1pzp7rs,,"​

”What… What do I have to do?”

​

“Return to the pumpkin patch where you found me.” Sparks flew in his gaping maw. ​

”Are you crazy?",28,29
1pzp7rs,,I’m never going out there ever again!,7,30
1pzp7rs,,Did you see what that beast did to me!” I lifted up my shirt sleeve and gazed into the shining center of its eyes.,24,31
1pzp7rs,,"​

”You are absolutely right, the danger the wolf poses is immense, but soon it will no longer be bound to the forest.",23,32
1pzp7rs,,"I believe it has already begun seeping into your dreams.”

​

”How do you know that!” I spat.",18,33
1pzp7rs,,"​

”I can see it well through those eyes.” I turned my head and covered my face. ​

”That will not stop me from seeing within.",26,34
1pzp7rs,,"I do not see things by conventional means.” The Jack-O-Lantern laughed, and my breathing picked up. ​

”Tell me what you are!",22,35
1pzp7rs,,I won’t do anything until you tell me that!” The pumpkin laughed further.,13,36
1pzp7rs,,"​

“Just a man like you, though I had to make some sacrifices to reach you.” I began to ask what that meant, but stopped myself, not even wishing to peruse this terrible information.",34,37
1pzp7rs,,"​

”So what? Kill the wolf before it becomes too strong?”

​

”Exactly.” I stared in disbelief and felt an intensifying warble in my stomach.",25,38
1pzp7rs,,"​

”With my father's rifle then?",6,39
1pzp7rs,,"That’s the only way I could think to kill a thing like that.”

​

”Boy, any man who found himself face to face with that beast, only armed with a rifle, would consider themselves very unlucky.",36,40
1pzp7rs,,"Yes, it may be wise to bring but I have provided the weapon with which you will kill the wolf.” A spark flew out, and I followed it to an object sitting on my bedside counter, which I had never seen before.",42,41
1pzp7rs,,"A small, wooden stick which looked to be carved from the oldest tree on earth and came to a sharp point in the last few inches. ​

”This?",28,42
1pzp7rs,,"Are you serious?”

​

”I know it doesn’t look like much, but I promise it’s the best shot we have.” I shook my head. ​

”This is crazy.",28,43
1pzp7rs,,I’m not doing any of this.,6,44
1pzp7rs,,"I mean, I just got back from the hospital.”

​

”If you stop now, then the only rest you will be finding is in death, son.” My face flushed, and I turned away to face the wall.",37,45
1pzp7rs,,*This is crazy. I can’t do this.,7,46
1pzp7rs,,"I won’t do this!* And then as if on cue, a flash of the black wolf cracked through my mind, sending me reeling to the ground, clutching my head.",29,47
1pzp7rs,,"“You would be a fool to reject my warnings, boy. I promise it will not end well for you.” I muffled screams from the agony blasting through my mind.",29,48
1pzp7rs,,"​

”How do I make it stop?” I gritted my teeth; the taste of blood was now noticeable in my mouth. ​

“You have been marked by the beast.",29,49
1pzp7rs,,"If nothing is done, you will carry on like this until you die, where your soul will follow him for the rest of eternity.",24,50
1pzp7rs,,"Kill him now, and I believe you can walk free.”

My teeth gritted harder, and the taste of blood expanded over my entire palate.",24,51
1pzp7rs,,"My head spun from this information, and it took several moments for my mind to regain balance from the pain.",20,52
1pzp7rs,,"When it finally did, I sat up and stared at the pumpkin with desperation in my eyes.",17,53
1pzp7rs,,“Tonight you will go back to the pumpkin patch armed with the staff and your father's rifle.,17,54
1pzp7rs,,"There you will put an end to the wolf and free yourself from suffering.” Cold sweat rolled down my brow, and I nodded with the same desperation.",27,55
1pzp7rs,,"​

”I’ll do it. I’ll do anything.”

​

And so the time passed.",13,56
1pzp7rs,,"Several times the pain in my head returned, which sent me into a fit; however, thankfully, none were as severe as the first.",23,57
1pzp7rs,,I spoke to my parents incrementally throughout the day to mask the severe task I would have to take on later.,21,58

1pzp7rs,,"After a day of paranoia and anticipation, the sun finally began to set, and so to did my preparations.",19,60
1pzp7rs,,"While my father took his evening walk, I snuck into his room and easily bypassed the code on his hunting shelf, acquiring his rifle and plenty of ammo to suit it.",31,61
1pzp7rs,,"Taking it to my room, I wore my thickest clothes and packed the two weapons the Jack-O-Lantern informed me I would need.",22,62
1pzp7rs,,"After it was dark outside, I looked around and made sure my parents had gone to their room for bed.",20,63
1pzp7rs,,"Taking one final look back at my room, I noticed the Jack-O-Lantern no longer sat on the bed, causing me to rush back in and search.",26,64
1pzp7rs,,"​

”Down here,” he whispered from my bag. I looked down and from the slight opening could see that grin staring back at me.",24,65
1pzp7rs,,"​

”How did you get there?”

​

”I ask myself that every day.” I shook my head at this cryptic answer and walked forward quietly.",25,66
1pzp7rs,,"Grabbing a hold of the door, I opened it slowly and made very little noise until something began aggressively nudging my leg.",22,67
1pzp7rs,,"Looking down in a panic, I saw Miley staring up at me wildly as if she knew exactly what I was doing.",22,68
1pzp7rs,,"​

”Down girl, stop,” I whispered and shook my leg, but she did not cease.",15,69
1pzp7rs,,"I opened the door further to continue walking out, and at the first chance, she bolted out of the house, turning back to stare defiantly in my eyes.",28,70
1pzp7rs,,"“I cannot bring you with me!” I said sternly after shutting the front door. Her gaze did not falter, and in my mind I felt something loosen.",27,71
1pzp7rs,,"*She’s been with me in this since the beginning, and I suppose she’ll see it through.* Taking a few stiff steps forward, Miley jumped up in excitement, seeing me comply and followed me along happily into the darkness.",38,72
1pzp7rs,,"I wondered if she knew what she was getting herself into, but after her last encounter in the woods, I figured there was no way she didn’t.",27,73
1pzp7rs,,"Reaching the tree line, I looked back at my home one last time and wondered if it would be the last time.",22,74
1pzp7rs,,I tried to shake these thoughts out of my mind and told myself.,13,75
1pzp7rs,,"*I will be back.*

​

Together Miley and I walked down the dark path, which was only illuminated by my narrow flashlight.",22,76
1pzp7rs,,"Miley's gold fur bounced in front of me, leading me where I knew we had to go.",17,77
1pzp7rs,,"It was quiet for a long while until a muffled crackle was heard from inside my bag, where the Jack-O-Lantern rested.",21,78
1pzp7rs,,"Opening up the satchel, I was shocked to see that the state of the pumpkin was rapidly deteriorating. ​

”What’s happening to you?” I asked in a hushed whisper.",29,79
1pzp7rs,,"A faint crackle and spark came from the rotting pumpkin's mouth before it spoke. ​

”Worry not, my boy. This form was always meant to be a fleeting one.",29,80
1pzp7rs,,"More of my power is required now to protect us from the evils that await, and thus I shall decay.”

​

”Will you die?”

​

”Ha! Like this?",28,81
1pzp7rs,,"Never in a million years, my boy.” And with that, we kept walking in silence.",15,82
1pzp7rs,,"I knew now, based on how far we had come, that we were rapidly closing in on the pumpkin patch, and my heart thumped rapidly.",25,83
1pzp7rs,,"The wind swelled, and the screams which I remembered from the first night exploded all around me.",17,84
1pzp7rs,,"Miley's happy trot slowed to a serious march, and through a large gust of wind, a subtle sound could be heard that made her go ballistic.",26,85
1pzp7rs,,"​

”What is it, girl?” I said having to scream over the wind, but she did not cease.",18,86
1pzp7rs,,"Instead, she ran out in the darkness, causing me to go out in a dead sprint after her.",18,87
1pzp7rs,,"I ran as hard as I could with the heavy baggage I had on me, but it was not enough to catch her.",23,88
1pzp7rs,,"Instead, after only a moment, I tripped over a large branch and fell flat on my face, sending my light flying out into the distance.",25,89
1pzp7rs,,"Sitting up as quickly as I could, I rubbed the dirt out of my face and immediately felt a great panic.",21,90
1pzp7rs,,"*The pumpkin!* Picking up my bag and using only the light of the moon to search for him, I found him intact even if a little bent.",27,91
1pzp7rs,,"​

”Do not lose focus now. You are in the belly of the beast,” he crackled with a slight spark.",20,92
1pzp7rs,,"Very slowly, I made my way over to my light and picked it up.",14,93
1pzp7rs,,"Lifting it, I jumped as the beam came back to life, and the wolf immediately became clear dozens of yards away. “Brace yourself!” The Jack-O-Lantern called out firmly.",28,94
1pzp7rs,,"Noticing something at the edge of the light beam, I turned to see another wolf just like the first staring right at me as well.",25,95
1pzp7rs,,"I let out a slight whimper as I turned the light further and discovered an absurd many wolves all standing confidently and staring down at me. ​

“What is this?",30,96
1pzp7rs,,"How can this be?”

​

”All trickery.",7,97
1pzp7rs,,"Do not waver.” I stood and continued looking around at the wolves, which, upon further inspection, looked to be in the number close to a hundred.",26,98
1pzp7rs,,"Miley barked wildly out in the distance, but no matter where I shone the light, I could not find her.",20,99
1pzp7rs,,"​

”They’re going to kill her!” I screamed down at the Jack-O-Lantern.",12,100
1pzp7rs,,"​

”Only if you fail here now.” And with that, I waited for whatever it was the pumpkin warned me of.",21,101
1pzp7rs,,"Turning the light obsessively, it seemed like more and more wolves were appearing by the moment and in a great shock, a slight tickle brushed against my ankle.",28,102
1pzp7rs,,"Looking down, I was horrified to see some mass of black fur bubbling and twisting at my feet.",18,103
1pzp7rs,,"I tried to step back, but only landed in more of the mass, which spread rapidly in the yards around me. ​

”What?",23,104
1pzp7rs,,No-“ I tried to begin screaming out but the Jack-O-Lantern hushed me.,12,105
1pzp7rs,,"​

”Do NOT let it into your mind!” I stared down in disbelief at it and felt something curious.",19,106
1pzp7rs,,"My scars from the wolf were tickling, and after a moment, I connected what this must mean. *This isn’t real.",20,107
1pzp7rs,,"This isn’t happening.* I found this mantra as the mass of wolf bubbled up, which now dawned eyes, teeth and random parts that grew up pants my knees to my waist.",31,108
1pzp7rs,,*This is not real!,4,109
1pzp7rs,,"This is not happening!* I repeated aggressively in my mind, and with a spark from the pumpkin, a bright purple light shone out into the distance in all directions.",29,110
1pzp7rs,,"For a moment, I could see nothing, but as my eyes adjusted, I saw there was no longer any mass of wolves nor a hundred of them as there had been before.",32,111
1pzp7rs,,"I looked down at the pumpkin and noticed its exterior was now more blackened than before and softening greatly. ​

“Was that your doing?” I asked in amazement.",28,112
1pzp7rs,,"​

”Not mine, yours.” I stared in disbelief down at him and noticed further how weak he looked. ​

”You’re… rotting.”

​

”I am.",24,113
1pzp7rs,,"We don’t have much time, but we certainly have enough, my boy.” I nodded my head and travelled forward until I heard Miley’s bark close.",25,114
1pzp7rs,,"I pointed my light in the direction and was relieved to see her galloping towards me without a scratch. ​

”Miley!",21,115
1pzp7rs,,"Where were you?” I bent down and hugged my dog. ​

”She had to be brave to survive that.",19,116
1pzp7rs,,"You’ll find that she is marked as well.” My eyes widened, and I checked her coat to see that, indeed, under that mass of fur, there was a healing slash.",30,117
1pzp7rs,,"​

”So she’s been dealing with the same visions as me?”

​

”Indeed.” I shook my head and hugged Miley tighter. ​

”Oh, I’m so sorry, Miley.",27,118
1pzp7rs,,"You’ve been so strong.” She let out a small yip, and I turned, directing the light with me as I did.",21,119
1pzp7rs,,"Not even five yards away, the now lone black wolf stood and stared hatefully at us.",16,120
1pzp7rs,,"It growled and began walking forward until the Jack-O-Lantern screamed out louder than I had ever heard. ​

”Back, you foul beast!",22,121
1pzp7rs,,"Begone from this world where you do not belong!” And with that, the wolf lunged forward but only succeeded in slamming hard into a clear purple wall.",27,122
1pzp7rs,,"“Take out your gun, my boy.",6,123
1pzp7rs,,"Use it well.” Taking out my weapon, I aimed true at the wolf, which mauled and scratched at the wall, cracking and chipping with every blow to it.",28,124
1pzp7rs,,"Finally ready, I fired into the wolf, which passed through the glass wall, sending shards of it into the wolf with the bullet.",23,125
1pzp7rs,,"The beast recoiled, falling on its back, kicking its legs up and around.",13,126
1pzp7rs,,"“Pay attention, Connor, your bullets will do little to harm this monster, but shards of this spiritual energy will.",19,127
1pzp7rs,,Shoot it through the glass.” I questioned none of this and continued firing around the wolf and into the glass.,20,128
1pzp7rs,,"Shards rained down upon the wolf, and it cried out in agony. I looked down at the Jack-O-Lantern and screamed. ​

”What now? He’s hurt!",25,129
1pzp7rs,,"What do we do?”

​

“It will reveal its true self to us.",13,130
1pzp7rs,,"Grasp the staff I presented to you and stab with your heart.” Picking up the small wooden stick back at the house made me feel weak and scared, but now gave me a confidence I doubted I had ever felt before.",41,131
1pzp7rs,,"The wolf continued its toiling and began emitting what looked like dark smoke, which wrapped and twisted around its body.",20,132
1pzp7rs,,"When the smoke began to shift into something tangible, I knew what the pumpkin meant by its true form.",19,133
1pzp7rs,,"The beast, which had once been a wolf, now rose into the sky as if weighing less than air, stretching its great arms out and shrieking into the night with a horrific, shrill pitch.",34,134
1pzp7rs,,"Jumping forward, Miley barked and howled at the beast and refused to quit when I begged her to stop.",19,135
1pzp7rs,,"After the dark smoke, which now made up the beast's body, quit swirling and formed into a solid dark mass, it lunged down at Miley as if pushing off an invisible wall in the sky.",35,136
1pzp7rs,,"Rocketing down, Miley stood tall and leapt up to clamp her jaw down around the thing's legs as it tried to swipe the staff out of my hands.",28,137
1pzp7rs,,"When she did this, the beast flew completely off course and crashed into a nearby bush.",16,138
1pzp7rs,,"​

“Miley!” I screamed out and rushed forward, not going without recognizing that the monster would have taken my hand clean off if not for her intervention.",27,139
1pzp7rs,,"Diving into the bush, I found Miley ripping and tearing at the hulking thing whose eyes bulged and spun around in its skull, looking as if it did not know where it was.",33,140
1pzp7rs,,"The parts where Miley bit evaporated and floated away in the same black smoke as before. ​

“You must hurry, boy.",21,141
1pzp7rs,,"Once it becomes acclimated to this form, you will have little chance.” I gulped from the pumpkin's message and rushed forward, raising the staff above my head.",27,142
1pzp7rs,,"At this, the beast's eyes locked onto the weapon and let out that same inhuman shriek, sending myself and Miley reeling backwards.",22,143
1pzp7rs,,"After this, it bolted up and began bouncing through the trees with the same smoky haze trailing behind it. ​

“How do I hit it?",25,144
1pzp7rs,,"I can’t reach it!” I screamed out to the pumpkin, keeping my eyes locked on the monster. ​

“You have to focus, Connor.",23,145
1pzp7rs,,"There will be things I cannot explain to you.”

​

A great anger filled my head hearing this, and I foolishly looked down at the pumpkin, which was now so far along in the stage of rot I could hardly believe it still spoke to me.",46,146
1pzp7rs,,"The moment I did this, the beast swung down, bringing its great hand back to swipe the staff from my hand, but strangely, though my eyes were not locked on the beast, I knew its every movement.",37,147
1pzp7rs,,"Just as it reeled its hand forward, I sent my own outward, plunging the staff into it. The shriek it now uttered filled up every sensory outlet I had.",29,148
1pzp7rs,,taking me reeling back and fighting for consciousness.,8,149
1pzp7rs,,"As I lay looking up at the sky, I tried to move my limbs, doing so and lifting myself to gaze upon what had come of the beast.",28,150
1pzp7rs,,"Black smoke exploded from its body in all directions and swirled into the air as the husk below it melted into the dirt. ​

“Careful, boy.",26,151
1pzp7rs,,"This is not yet over.”

​

I looked down at the pumpkin, which now only appeared as a black mess in the dirt, and I could not help from letting air escape my lungs, seeing which was once so perfect in such a state.",44,152
1pzp7rs,,"Then, in a blade of purple light, I found myself experiencing a new sight that saw a projectile imminently approaching me.",21,153
1pzp7rs,,"I lunged forward as a tentacle of black smoke plunged toward Miley and grabbed it out of the air right before it reached her. ​

“Miley, get out of here!",30,154
1pzp7rs,,"You’ve already done enough!” I screamed at her, but it was too late.",13,155
1pzp7rs,,"Another hand of black smoke reached out towards her and grabbed her hind legs, pulling her back towards the melting mass.",21,156
1pzp7rs,,"I screamed out and ran for her, but stopped when I witnessed what I was entering.",16,157
1pzp7rs,,The beast had fully become a sludge which not only sank into the earth but bent and split it into an abyss which went farther than the eye could see.,30,158
1pzp7rs,,"I looked at Miley, who gnawed and clawed the arm but was unable to put a scratch on it. ​

“It is going back to its land of origin now.",30,159
1pzp7rs,,I suggest you act if you want to be with your dog when they meet on the other side.” I turned to look in disbelief at the pumpkin but realized I could not see him any longer.,37,160

1pzha0n,,"I was working on something I can't even remember now, and feeling pretty cozy, so I decided that rather than go all the way downstairs, I'd just quickly check the bunny and cat cameras to see how everyone was holding up in the weather.",44,9

1pzha0n,,"However, I was feeling a little freaked myself, and wanted to see what was going on to startle her, so I kept moving the feed closer and closer to live to see what caused her to run off.",38,18

1pzgq7c,,"When they placed me on the transplant list, that was the moment it became real.",15,13

1pzgq7c,,"I didn’t believe any of it, of course. I was just desperate enough to read it.",16,22
1pzgq7c,,That was when I stumbled on a private startup surgical company that specialised in transplants.,15,23
1pzgq7c,,It felt impossible that such a highly niche practice existed within travelling distance of my home.,16,24
1pzgq7c,,"The reviews claimed almost perfect satisfaction, with waiting times measured in weeks and rejection rates below 0.1%. They boasted top surgeons and outcomes that seemed almost unrealistic.",27,25
1pzgq7c,,"The more I looked, the more I caught myself lingering on the smallest spark of hope, even if it was fleeting. I compared their wait times against mine.",28,26
1pzgq7c,,I compared their cost against my life. It did not take long before the numbers began to weigh in their favour.,21,27
1pzgq7c,,"Twelve hours of driving, another three hours of waiting, and I finally met the clinic’s doctors to discuss how this would all work.",23,28
1pzgq7c,,"A spark of anxiety hit me as I stepped into the doctor’s office. The pleasantries were brief, and the doctor went straight into it. “Mr. Thomas Sallow, age 28.",29,29
1pzgq7c,,"Blood type AB positive. Dilated cardiomyopathy. Left ventricular ejection fraction at twenty percent. NYHA class three. Life expectancy, optimistically, two years.",21,30
1pzgq7c,,"No medical insurance.” He put the papers down and steepled his fingers. “You are, a very typical case.",18,31
1pzgq7c,,"But we will ensure you will get what you need efficiently and safely.”

I swallowed hard, my mouth dry. “And… what are the next steps?”

He gave a small nod.",30,32
1pzgq7c,,"“We perform a full pre-transplant evaluation. Blood panels, imaging, psychosocial screening, infectious disease checks.",14,33
1pzgq7c,,"We need to know you are stable enough for surgery, and that post-operatively you can adhere to treatment. Once complete, a suitable organ can be matched within two weeks.",29,34
1pzgq7c,,"Our success rates are excellent. Post op survival is above ninety-nine percent.”

My eyes widened at that. I almost asked how many patients but stopped myself.",26,35
1pzgq7c,,"“How is it so high while being so fast?” I asked instead. “We’ve optimised every stage. From evaluation to surgery, there is no delay.",24,36
1pzgq7c,,Our protocols are designed to minimise waiting time without compromising quality. We work with the right team who get what we need.,22,37

I hesitated. “And the cost?”

“As you have no insurance, we do offer arrangements, of course.",26,38
1pzgq7c,,"We have simple payment plans that can fit into anyone’s budget, especially in cases like yours. This is a premium service you must understand.",24,39
1pzgq7c,,"As you’ve heard, you would not be waiting months or years for a false promise.”

I tried to digest it.",20,40
1pzgq7c,,"The figures, the timelines, the detached calm with which he described my own failing heart. Somehow, hearing him speak, knowing someone could fix this, I felt hope.",27,41
1pzgq7c,,"“And the procedure itself?” I asked. “Standard transplant surgery,” he said, as if discussing an everyday office visit. “We remove what is failing, we replace it with what is functional.",30,42
1pzgq7c,,Routine monitoring and standard recovery follows. Nothing to worry about. You will be in good hands.,16,43

I nodded again, my pulse uneven, my chest tight.",16,44
1pzgq7c,,"The papers were signed, my details exchanged, and the pre-tests performed quickly, the only discomfort coming from the blood they drew.",21,45
1pzgq7c,,"As I went to the receptionist to finalise everything, she handed me a bottle of pills.",16,46
1pzgq7c,,"“Take twice a day, once before sleep and once at midday.”

1pzgq7c,,"Faintness mixed with a rising, primal fear kept me aware, that something was very wrong.",15,52
1pzgq7c,,"My heart hammered, not fast, but heavy, like each beat was trying to break through bone. I breathed in air that felt moist.",23,53
1pzgq7c,,"It clung to the inside of my throat, thick and warm, filling my lungs with something that tasted wrong. Acrid, chemical, metallic. Like breathing in heated oil fumes.",28,54
1pzgq7c,,"My body felt feverish, the heat rolling under my skin in waves that made my nerves twitch and curl.",19,55
1pzgq7c,,Pain threaded through every part of me like my insides were bruising with each breath.,15,56

1pzgq7c,,"And through it, against the far wall, I saw something. A texture. Wet. Sinewy. Hugging the surface like it had grown there instead of being placed. Something red. Something raw.",30,58
1pzgq7c,,"I jerked awake in a chill so violent it almost hurt. Fear crawled cold through my body, the kind that didn’t fade once the room came into focus.",28,59
1pzgq7c,,I wished it had been the only time.,8,60
1pzgq7c,,"But night after night, my mind returned to the same dream, as if whatever I’d seen was waiting for me behind my eyelids.",23,61
1pzgq7c,,"I tried to explain what I saw to the nurses over the phone, but they simply dismissed me.",18,62
1pzgq7c,,"They gestured vaguely to the ‘symptoms’ of the medication I was on, as if that answered everything.",17,63
1pzgq7c,,"When I described in detail what I saw, they dismissed that out of hand, barely listening before reassuring me it was all perfectly normal. But I couldn’t let it lie.",30,64
1pzgq7c,,"By the third night of sleep, I could paint the dream so vividly. I could describe it in such detail. What I saw, what I smelt, what I felt.",29,65
1pzgq7c,,"The heat, the moisture, the rawness clinging to the walls. I could see the pain around me. I could feel the horror.",22,66
1pzgq7c,,The red room stared at me though a blur.,9,67

1pzgq7c,,"The air shimmered with a damp, metallic heat, as though the very atmosphere had been distilled from raw flesh.",19,69
1pzgq7c,,"It tried its best to hide the shapes behind it, but the veil would slip. Beneath the fog, the walls pulsed.",21,70
1pzgq7c,,"Slow, damp, rhythmic, as if the room itself had veins. I breathed in through a hole in my face.",19,71
1pzgq7c,,"Not a mouth at all, just a wet opening, soft around the edges, working like a gill. No teeth. No tongue. Only a hollow space sucking in thick, spoiled air.",30,72
1pzgq7c,,"Each inhalation dragged something viscous down my throat, burning with a sour tang that coated the inside of me like oil.",21,73
1pzgq7c,,"The air didn’t fill my lungs; it scraped them, as though drawn through needles, each breath stitching pain into the lining of my chest. And then the tearing began.",29,74
1pzgq7c,,"A pressure deep in my core, pounding like fists against the inside of my torso. A hammering intending to break me open from within. Nerves flared. Muscles convulsed.",28,75
1pzgq7c,,"I felt things shifting, rearranging, shaping themselves without my permission. As if something were creating a habitat inside me. If I could have gagged or coughed, I would have.",29,76
1pzgq7c,,"If I could have screamed, I might never have stopped. But I simply could not. When I woke from them, I was glad to be gone.",26,77
1pzgq7c,,"But it followed me outside of my mind, I could feel its presence in the waking world.",17,78
1pzgq7c,,"Something unfinished, something breathing just out of sight, waiting for me to close my eyes again.",16,79
1pzgq7c,,"Almost like the first time I suffered the heart attack, I would feel a beat stutter in my chest, then another.",21,80
1pzgq7c,,"As if a second heart tried to pulse in place of my own, an alien thump struggling to match my natural rhythm.",22,81
1pzgq7c,,"Sometimes the two beats aligned for a moment before slipping apart again, sending a faint vibration through my ribs like plucked strings trembling out of tune.",26,82
1pzgq7c,,"Every time I inhaled fresh air, I would exhale foul taste. The gore-thick vapour from the red room.",18,83
1pzgq7c,,It coated my tongue with the coppery sting of blood that wasn’t there.,13,84
1pzgq7c,,"My nerves buzzed beneath my skin in tiny, frantic sparks, as if something just under the surface was testing each strand, humming along them like someone running fingers across exposed wires.",31,85
1pzgq7c,,"And sometimes, without warning, a phantom warmth bloomed across my torso, thick and suffocating, the same oppressive heat from the red room seeping through my skin as if my own flesh remembered a climate my waking mind rejected.",38,86
1pzgq7c,,"At other times, I would glance down and find one of my arms hanging uselessly at my side, limp and numb, as if it no longer belonged to me.",29,87
1pzgq7c,,"I would try to lift it, command it, will it to move, and nothing would happen.",16,88
1pzgq7c,,"The dead weight of it would send a cold spike of fear through me, a split-second conviction that the limb wasn’t absent because it failed to obey, but because, on some level, it simply wasn’t there.",36,89
1pzgq7c,,"The urge to gag, to cough, clung to the base of my throat, a reflex trapped behind a body that refused to respond.",23,90
1pzgq7c,,"My lungs would hitch, hesitate, then drag in air with a strange, uneven pull, leaving a prickling after-burn that lingered.",20,91
1pzgq7c,,"These moments would strike suddenly or creep over me in slow waves, settling into my muscles, nestling behind my ribs.",20,92
1pzgq7c,,"They would find me as I tried to work, or rest, or play. As I tried, in whatever small ways I could manage, to continue living.",26,93
1pzgq7c,,"One moment I was sitting in the park, sunlight warming my skin, the mundane chatter of the world all around me… and then I blinked.",25,94
1pzgq7c,,"The pulse of red screamed through my ears as the trees blurred into wet silhouettes. My stomach clenched, sour and hollow, as if blood‑bile were rising in my gut. “Yo!",30,95
1pzgq7c,,"Thomas!” a voice cried from behind. A face appeared in my periphery, one I knew all too well.",18,96
1pzgq7c,,I could tell which one it was by the nose piercing that the other one lacked.,16,97

“I know you got your surgery all lined up and everything but god you look, shaken.",18,98
1pzgq7c,,"You all good?” Beck sat on the bench next to me, shouldering my arm for a reaction. “Oh, yea… I’m fine really.",22,99
1pzgq7c,,I just…” I couldn’t find the words to explain what I was feeling.,13,100
1pzgq7c,,"“Maybe it’s weird to say but, I’ve been having these dreams lately and I’m starting to think that it’s affecting me when I’m awake.”

“Like how?” 

“Well, sometimes it feels like I need to clear my throat, or my heart almost skips a beat.",44,101
1pzgq7c,,"Not in a heart failure sort of way.” I try to joke. “Like, there is a second beat.”

Beck looked at me with a curious expression.",26,102
1pzgq7c,,"“Sounds like Rach and I.”

“What?”

“It’s a twin thing, sometimes I feel a presence or a feeling which isn’t mine. But somewhere deep inside I know it’s her.",29,103
1pzgq7c,,Maybe she was worried about a car payment and I would sense her anxiety or if I just ran a marathon she would be exhausted.,25,104
1pzgq7c,,"That sort of thing.”

I smiled at her explanation. “Sure, but I don’t think it’s that.”

Beck rolled her eyes.",20,105
1pzgq7c,,"“I know, I was just trying to describe what I sounded like.” She paused, tapping her boot against the path. “Could be nothing.",23,106
1pzgq7c,,"Some people swear organ donors and recipients get… connected somehow. Like echoes. I read that once.”

I shook my head. “Yeah, no. That’s not what this is.”

She shrugged.",29,107
1pzgq7c,,"“Fair enough. I can’t relate to many people other than Rach. You get it.”

Honestly, I didn’t get it at all.",21,108
1pzgq7c,,"The dream returned, but this time it was no drifting blur. It came on with weight, like something lowering itself onto me.",22,109
1pzgq7c,,"Heat rolled through me in pulsing waves, each one heavier than the last, as if my own blood had been replaced with something thicker.",24,110
1pzgq7c,,"My chest rose in short, desperate bursts, each breath dragging through me like it was being pulled through foreign wires.",20,111
1pzgq7c,,"The air felt wrong again, dense and wet, but now it burned with a sharpness that tore at the inside of my throat.",23,112
1pzgq7c,,"I tried to cry out, or gasp, or do anything to relieve the pressure inside me, but I had no mouth. No lips. No proper shape to form sound.",29,113
1pzgq7c,,"Only the instinct, the frantic, animal certainty that something inside me needed to scream.",14,114
1pzgq7c,,"The groan that leaked from the hole in my face sent tremors of fear cascading through the room. My lungs ached, craving more air than they could pull in.",29,115
1pzgq7c,,"Each inhale felt like drawing breath through syringes, thin, painful streams of oxygen stabbing into tissue that wasn’t ready for it. My chest tightened in rhythmic spasms.",27,116
1pzgq7c,,"I felt the urge to cough, but my body couldn’t. There was no mechanism for it, no release.",18,117
1pzgq7c,,"In the dream, it always started with the pain of existence, and then my vision would slowly build to reveal the red room.",23,118
1pzgq7c,,"But this time, it didn’t drift into focus. This time it was immediate, an unfiltered, raw stare that made my vision feel exposed.",23,119
1pzgq7c,,"Everything was too bright and too raw, as if my eyes were fresh, forced to see before they were ready.",20,120
1pzgq7c,,"I saw a ceiling above me, or something like a ceiling. It rippled faintly, as if it were breathing, as if the structure itself inhaled with me inside it.",29,121
1pzgq7c,,"I tried to look away, but my head refused to move. It felt like trying to drag a bruised muscle, a muscle detached from the bone, limp and useless.",29,122
1pzgq7c,,"Shapes swam at the edges of my vision. The walls were close, hugging inward with a strange, pulsing warmth.",19,123
1pzgq7c,,"Their colour shifted subtly, beating in time with something I felt more than heard. A deep, wet throb vibrated through me. My heart responded in kind.",26,124
1pzgq7c,,"Pain bloomed through my body suddenly, a hot, starburst ache that flared from places I couldn’t name. It felt like something beneath me was growing, stretching, pulling itself into shape.",30,125
1pzgq7c,,"Each shift pressed into me, forcing me into a form I didn’t recognise. With powerful strain, I managed to move my head, limp as it was on its perch.",29,126
1pzgq7c,,"Something tore inside me as I pulled, a slow drag of tissue stretching past its limit.",16,127
1pzgq7c,,"Then came the sound, sharp pops, wet snaps, the peel of flesh separating from something it had fused to.",19,128

1pzgq7c,,"There wasn’t one. Instead, a garden of organs sprawled across the ground in front of me, glistening under the red light.",21,130
1pzgq7c,,"Wet, bulbous sacks pulsed gently, each containing a vital piece of what had once been my human life.",18,131
1pzgq7c,,"They were arranged without logic or anatomy, sprouting at odd heights and angles, stitched to the masses of meat carpet by ropes of veiny sinew.",25,132
1pzgq7c,,"Veins ran like climbing vines, looping and knotting, binding everything into a trembling mesh. A nervous system stretched out like a fisherman’s net, every strand quivering with faint electrical life.",30,133
1pzgq7c,,"The muscles, what remained of them, hung in long, stringy curtains. Some were still twitching, spasms rippling through fibres that no longer belonged to anything.",25,134
1pzgq7c,,"The lungs looked atrophied, inflating and deflating in slow, obedient rhythm, long spinal tendrils drilled into them to support their structure.",21,135
1pzgq7c,,"The spine was splayed open and hung crookedly, suspended from the wall and floor by ligaments that had fused into stiff, branching tendrils.",23,136
1pzgq7c,,"And my heart, sat where it should in proportion to the rest, each artery attached and draped into small orifices, the flesh walls greedily sucking from its life giving energies.",30,137
1pzgq7c,,"Everything else was refuse. Scraps. A butcher’s sweepings arranged into a shrine of meat. I tried to recoil, to scream, to do anything, but my form could only spasm.",29,138
1pzgq7c,,"The nerve net shivered violently, sending lashes of pain knifing through me. Each twitch peeled back another layer of agony, like nerves being flossed with barbed wire.",27,139
1pzgq7c,,I wanted to close my eyes. I wanted that more than anything. But they stayed open.,16,140
1pzgq7c,,"They did not so much look as receive, forced to drink in the shifting, living red around me.",18,141
1pzgq7c,,"Another pulse of pain climbed what should have been my spine, but was now a writhing column of nerves.",19,142
1pzgq7c,,"A cord of hardened muscle tightened suddenly and yanked my head back, slamming it into the pulsing mound behind me.",20,143
1pzgq7c,,"Something soft burst under the impact, warm fluid trickling down my neck as my head was shoved into its original place.",21,144
1pzgq7c,,"My too-sharp vision took it all in at once, like a television suddenly in widescreen.",15,145
1pzgq7c,,"The once cavernous room now felt smaller, filled with the red mass cradling me with its disgusting essence.",18,146
1pzgq7c,,"The final thought of that dream was simple and terrifying: was the room getting smaller, or was I getting bigger?",20,147
1pzgq7c,,"The dream ended the moment the pain peaked, a white-hot spear stabbing through my consciousness.",15,148
1pzgq7c,,"I woke in my room gasping, sweating, clawing at my own face just to feel the relief of eyelids closing over my eyes.",23,149
1pzgq7c,,"And I could still feel phantom heat lingering under my skin. I lay there for a long moment, chest heaving, the phantom heat crawling under my skin.",27,150
1pzgq7c,,"Eventually, I forced myself to sit up. The room was quiet, normal, or as normal as my bedroom could feel after what I had just endured.",26,151
1pzgq7c,,"I rubbed my face, trying to convince myself it had been just a dream.",14,152
1pzgq7c,,"I did my best to focus on life for those weeks but the feelings left me hollow. A fear, rational and patient, was waiting for me.",26,153
1pzgq7c,,"Always there when I slept. Soon, a donor was found and my surgery was scheduled. They were professional and prepped me quickly and efficiently.",24,154
1pzgq7c,,"When I was on the table, with the surgeons standing around me, all I could think of was that the red room was waiting.",24,155
1pzgq7c,,"Once I went under, I would be there again, unable to scream, unable to move, witnessing the vile deconstruction of myself again.",22,156
1pzgq7c,,"The doctor reassured me as they placed the mask over me, my heart beating at an irregular rhythm. Everything was going to be alright.",24,157
1pzgq7c,,"\*\*\*

It’s been a month since my surgery, and I no longer think about the red room.",17,158
1pzgq7c,,"I recovered flawlessly, barring the payments I now have to live with for probably the rest of my life, I am free to do what I want.",27,159
1pzgq7c,,"I can breathe freely now, each inhale smooth and full, no longer stabbing like syringes through my lungs.",18,160
1pzgq7c,,"I can blink without pain, the simple act of closing my eyes a relief so intense it feels almost ecstatic.",20,161
1pzgq7c,,"My heart beats as it should, steady, strong, completely my own. These memories, even though they are mine, belong to a life that wasn’t.",24,162
1pzgq7c,,I’m glad I was able to escape that place. I’m glad I was the one to be here. I thank you for what you did. You saved me.,28,163
1pzgq7c,,"And for that, I’m sorry Thomas.",6,164
1pzffns,I work security at a storage warehouse. There’s one door we’re not allowed to open.,"As I realized that my company granted key card had failed to open the employee entrance, I was left with no option but to hammer on the door until someone finally heard me.",33,0
1pzffns,,"After my hands were raw from slamming them against the metal surface for a minute, the door A minute later opened and I was met by a man in his early sixties, tall, well built, with heavy bags under his eyes.",41,1
1pzffns,,“You’re the new guy?” he half asked half stated. I nodded.,11,2
1pzffns,,"“Alright, come on in,” he said as he gestured for me to follow with a small wave, “I’ll show you everything you need to know for the job.”

He led me inside a small locker room and instructed me to change into a gray uniform.",45,3
1pzffns,,"“Number sixty-five is yours.”

The uniform consisted of pants, a shirt, a pair of shoes, and a thicker jacket to survive the cold within the warehouse itself.",27,4
1pzffns,,"The whole thing was a size too large, with the shoes too snug, but it didn’t seem that we were spoiled for options.",23,5
1pzffns,,"I felt something hard within the inner jacket pocket: a hip flask, still filled to the brim with an unknown liquid. I pulled it out to show the man.",29,6
1pzffns,,"“Yeah, good old Wallace. He worked here about ten years back, five people have worn that uniform since then.",19,7
1pzffns,,"The flask is still there.”

“So, I just keep it?”

“Well, it’s become something of a sacred artifact by now. Throw it out if you dare.",26,8
1pzffns,,"Myself, I’m superstitious,” he joked, but I put the flask back, nonetheless, deciding not to stand out and to keep the tradition going.",23,9
1pzffns,,"He then led me into a set of long, narrow corridors still existing from the cold-war era where everything was constructed with concrete, pretending to be able to withstand a nuclear blast.",32,10
1pzffns,,"With only a few doors on each side, one for the kitchen, the other for the storage facility, and the last for the surveillance room, there was little effort needed to memorize the layout of the facility, which served me well seeing as the interview had taken place off site.",50,11
1pzffns,,“How many questions did the suits ask you before deciding to give you the job?” the man asked.,18,12
1pzffns,,"“Eh, I think they asked around a dozen or so by the end,” I explained.",15,13
1pzffns,,"“That’s not what I asked,” he interjected, “I asked how many questions they presented before they decided to give you the job.”

“How should I know?”

“I would have.",29,14
1pzffns,,I reckon they decided to give you the job before you even showed up for the interview.,17,15
1pzffns,,"Everything else was just a formality.”

Deciding not to push the matter any further, I was led into the surveillance room.",21,16
1pzffns,,"It was a confined space with a single window leading outside, and a set of nine monitors above a narrow desk covered in personal affects, magazines, and half emptied pizza boxes from the prior shift.",35,17
1pzffns,,"In addition: a red, rotary phone connected to a landline lay on desk in one of the corners, covered in an inch thick layer of dust, unused for what must have been decades.",33,18
1pzffns,,"“This’ll be your office for the foreseeable future,” he said.",10,19
1pzffns,,"I wondered silently how pissed my colleagues would be if I cleaned the desk on my first shift and got rid of the garbage, but I figured it best to stay low until I’d been accepted as a part of the team.",42,20
1pzffns,,"After all, I would be starting out covering exclusively the night shift alone.",13,21
1pzffns,,"If I had any hope of being moved to the day shift, I shouldn’t start out by making enemies. “Any place I can smoke?” I asked.",26,22
1pzffns,,"“Cigarettes, I assume?”

I nodded.",5,23
1pzffns,,"“Open the window and hope you don’t trigger the smoke detector.”

The man sat down by one of the computers that had a scanning device attached.",26,24
1pzffns,,"Without looking at me, he reached out his hand gesturing for me to hand him something.",16,25
1pzffns,,"“Your keycard,” he clarified, “I need to activate it.”

I handed him my keycard, and he swiped it across the scanner.",21,26
1pzffns,,"“There, now you have access to almost every door in the warehouse.”

“Almost every door?” I repeated back to him in the form of a question.",26,27
1pzffns,,"“Yeah…” he paused, “let´s get back to that.”

From there, he briefly explained how the system worked, how to turn on and off the cameras, and how to access recorded footage.",31,28
1pzffns,,"There wasn’t all that much to it, and apart from a few notes on a piece of paper, I had it all down to memory.",25,29
1pzffns,,"“Working hours for the night shift are eight PM to four AM, followed by a brief change of guard, then at five the day shift officially takes over.",28,30
1pzffns,,"Couldn’t tell who’s relieving you in the morning but won’t be me this time.”

“So, that’s it?” I asked, “I sit here and watch the monitors, prevent anything from getting stolen?”

“Do you own a firearm?” he asked.",38,31
1pzffns,,"I shook my head. “You’re not a cop, you’re not an agent, you’re not an action hero.",17,32
1pzffns,,"If you see anything on these monitors, you call ‘911’ and hide until help arrives.",15,33
1pzffns,,"Your job is to alert the authorities if anything happens, not to step in and get yourself killed.",18,34
1pzffns,,"I need us to be absolutely clear on that,” he said, his demeanor suddenly changing from laid back to strict in a heartbeat.",23,35
1pzffns,,"“We’re clear,” I responded, slightly caught off guard.",8,36
1pzffns,,"“Do you expect these things to come up on a regular basis?”

“God, no, this is going to be the easiest job you’ve ever had.",25,37
1pzffns,,You can sit around and binge-watch your favorite show all night for all I care.,15,38
1pzffns,,"I’d recommend that old radio podcast ‘Unheard,’ they have a great episode about the 1993 missing cosmonauts.”

“Never heard about it.”

“Fair enough.",23,39
1pzffns,,"Now, about these cameras, they are going to do ninety-five percent of the job for you.",16,40
1pzffns,,"As long as you can recover footage and point at the screen, you’re golden.”

“And if the cameras go out?” I asked. “Son, these things haven’t malfunctioned since 1998.",29,41
1pzffns,,"If something happens to the wares and you can’t show us the recording of it happening, I’m going to assume you did it.”

“So, the cameras are infallible, got it.”

“Except for Camera number six, but that doesn’t matter, cause you ain’t going to need it.”

“What?” I asked.",49,42
1pzffns,,"“We’ll get back to that,” he repeated, “now let me give you a tour of the storage facility.”

We returned to the narrow hallway and went for the door in the middle, which took us into a large warehouse.",39,43
1pzffns,,"Inside there were rows upon rows of gray, plastic boxes of identical make and size, each marked with a three-digit number, but with no indication of what was kept inside.",30,44
1pzffns,,"I had never thought to ask what exactly would be stored within the warehouse, thinking it would be miscellaneous wares like every other storage facility in the area.",28,45
1pzffns,,"Still, due to the peculiarity of the place, something felt *off*. “What exactly are we storing?” I asked.",18,46
1pzffns,,"“Wouldn’t know, never asked.”

“And how long have you been working here?” I went on. “About twenty-eight years,” he replied, “it’s a good job, Son, with good pay and benefits.",30,47
1pzffns,,"Don’t waste it asking too many questions you don’t need the answer to.”

I sighed. I could abide by his instructions, but my curiosity was piqued.",26,48
1pzffns,,"I just nodded in agreement and tried my best to focus on information essential for the job. My job instructions were clear enough, after all.",25,49
1pzffns,,"But just as I had come to terms with ignoring the mystery, we then stopped in the middle of the outer section of storage shelves.",25,50
1pzffns,,"A single door was placed on the wall, wooden with a simple lock, not compatible with our keycards or any modern technology for that matter.",25,51
1pzffns,,"If I didn’t know any better, I would have assumed that it belonged to a residential building.",17,52
1pzffns,,"“What’s this?” I asked, immediately realizing that this would be another question left without a satisfactory answer, but unlike before he was more accommodating that time around.",27,53
1pzffns,,"“Yeah, this is one of the things I needed to show you,” he began, moving closer to the door as if inspecting it as one would a foreign object not belonging.",31,54
1pzffns,,"“Well?”

“I haven’t the faintest idea what’s behind this door,” he announced. “You’re not being serious, right now, are you?”

“Serious as a heart attack, Son.",26,55
1pzffns,,There’s a reason I’m showing you this.,7,56
1pzffns,,"You are not, under any circumstances to attempt to open this *thing* or to enter whatever on God’s green Earth is hidden behind this door.",25,57
1pzffns,,"That is not a suggestion, that is an order.”

“But you don’t know what’s behind it?”

“When I started here back in 97, I was told the same as you: do not open this door.",35,58
1pzffns,,"And from the tone of my supervisor, I knew to obey that order.",13,59
1pzffns,,"So, no, I haven’t opened it, which is why I can’t tell you what lays on the other side.”

He paused, knocking softly on the wooden frame around the door.",30,60
1pzffns,,"“I’ve had twelve guys under my supervision since them. All of them obeyed the same order, no questions asked, all except for two.”

“What happened to them?”

“I don’t know.",30,61
1pzffns,,"I just know that once they went inside, no one ever heard from them again.”

I couldn’t form adequate words to argue against him, so I just ended up staring at him with a dumbfounded expression on my face.",39,62
1pzffns,,"He sighed in response. “Look, you’re going to be sure I’m messing with you.",14,63
1pzffns,,"For the next few days, even weeks, you’ll almost be certain that I’m pulling some kind of practical joke on you. So, let’s make this simple.",26,64
1pzffns,,"You as much as try to open this door, and you’re fired.",12,65
1pzffns,,"Got it?”

“Yeah, I got it.”

He nodded in acknowledgement, before starting to lead me back to the office.",19,66
1pzffns,,"“And one more thing,” he said, redirecting his attention to the door, again, “it might not always be right here.”

“Excuse me?”

“It moves on occasion, takes the camera with it, as well.",33,67
1pzffns,,"Always one the outer walls, just not always here.”

“Then how I am I supposed to know which door it is?”

“Just look at it.",25,68
1pzffns,,"It doesn’t exactly match the rest of the interior, does it?”

“I guess, but…” I trailed off. “See that stain on the wall, next to the door?” he asked.",29,69
1pzffns,,"I nodded. “Yeah, they definitely need to clean that. Looks like mold,” he said, completely deviating from the subject at hand.",21,70
1pzffns,,"Overwhelmed by the introduction, I left it at that and decided just to follow any rules the man had parted upon me, no matter how bizarre.",26,71
1pzffns,,"He brought me back to the surveillance room, where he finally decided to introduce himself. “Oh, right. The name’s Robert Baily,” he said, offering his hand.",26,72
1pzffns,,"“Anthony River,” I responded, shaking his hand.",7,73
1pzffns,,"“Good luck on your first day, Anthony,” Robert said, “I’ll see you in a few days.”

\*\*\*

My first shift had started, and as Robert had promised, there was little to be done but to watch the nine, or at least eight functional monitors before me.",46,74
1pzffns,,"Throughout the night nothing changed, no one tried to break in, nothing malfunctioned. The aforementioned forbidden door remained in view of camera six and didn’t move throughout the night.",29,75
1pzffns,,"By all means the job was boring, but secure. And that is how it went for the next few days, weeks, months.",22,76
1pzffns,,"I’d be relieved by guys who hardly exchanged two words with me at the shift’s end, only to start again the following night.",23,77
1pzffns,,"On the occasional night that Robert handed the shift over to me or relieved me, I’d get the chance to exchange a few pleasantries.",24,78
1pzffns,,"It wasn’t much, but it helped me slide into a comfortable routine, and with the end of each month as I was paid my salary, it felt like I had found something to keep me over for the coming couple of years.",42,79
1pzffns,,It wasn’t until half a year had passed before something even remotely interesting would happen. It was an otherwise calm night.,21,80
1pzffns,,"I had finally gotten around to checking out Robert’s recommended radio podcast, which I could vaguely recall having heard as a child.",22,81
1pzffns,,"I glanced at the many monitors, as I did about once a minute, only to realize that camera number six had turned into a mess of static, accompanied by a distant screech that wasn’t coming from the monitor directly.",39,82
1pzffns,,"Remembering Robert’s advice about possible malfunctions on camera six, I didn’t think much of it, but I decided to check the warehouse out.",23,83
1pzffns,,"I entered into the narrow hallway, walking through the door to the warehouse for the first time that night, where I looked for camera six.",25,84
1pzffns,,"I knew it to be located on the outer, southern wall, a short distance from the surveillance room.",18,85
1pzffns,,"After a brisk walk, I was there, standing in front of a moldy stain on an otherwise empty wall. The door wasn’t there.",23,86
1pzffns,,"I made a double take and scanned the rest of the wall, but there was nothing there, even the door’s accompanying camera had gone missing.",25,87
1pzffns,,"Robert had told me that the door changed locations on a whim, but up until that point I believed it had been a turn of phrase, a joke not meant to be taken literally.",34,88
1pzffns,,"But sure enough, though I knew with absolute certainty where every camera in the building was located, I was standing in front of a naked wall.",26,89
1pzffns,,The door had vanished or had maybe moved just like Robert had said.,13,90
1pzffns,,"Knowing better than to search for the missing door, I returned to the surveillance room, intent on continuing my shift as if nothing had happened.",25,91
1pzffns,,"But upon arrival, I was met with a full set of functioning cameras, even number six had magically switched itself back on, again showing the door that had vanished, unchanged but for the fact that it had changed to an entirely different wall.",43,92
1pzffns,,"Confirming that the door still existed, I decided to check the warehouse again, not yet ready to believe the event my own eyes were witnessing.",25,93
1pzffns,,I rushed back into the warehouse and started my search.,10,94
1pzffns,,"I began with the empty southern wall where the door had originally existed, then the western, naked apart from the main exit, and then the northern wall, which had inexplicably created a new, wooden door in its build.",38,95
1pzffns,,"It was really there, the door didn’t match the rest of the interior, looking akin to a fragile, wooden door taken out of a fifties residential home.",27,96
1pzffns,,It had a handle and a simple lock absent its accompanying key.,12,97
1pzffns,,"For the first time, I was tempted to open it, but the earnest warnings of Robert Baily remained clear in my memory.",22,98
1pzffns,,"I wasn’t ready to lose my job just yet. Leaving it at that, I continued my shift as normal until my colleagues came to relieve me.",26,99
1pzffns,,"As fate would have it, Robert was the next one in line, giving me the chance to broach the subject with him, but before I was allowed to mention the moving door, he noticed that something was off.",38,100
1pzffns,,"“It happened, didn’t it?” he asked, but it was a question he didn’t need answered. “So, it’s true,” was all I could think to respond. “I can’t judge your skepticism.",30,101
1pzffns,,"I didn’t think it would take this long before the door moved,” he said, “though, I have to hand it to you, I’m impressed you didn’t go inside.”

“I was tempted to.”

“We call that discipline.",36,102
1pzffns,,"You didn’t give in to the temptation, and if you value your life, it’s absolutely essential that you never do.”

“You really don’t have any idea what’s inside?”

“No, nor do I want to know.",35,103
1pzffns,,"As I said, I’ve already lost people to whatever lays beyond the threshold of that door.",16,104
1pzffns,,"As you might have noticed by now, it doesn’t exactly abide by the laws of physics we know and love.”

“I’m not going to go inside.",26,105
1pzffns,,"I promise,” I said, completely believing my own statement, at least for the moment.",14,106
1pzffns,,"“Atta boy,” Robert responded as he patted me on my shoulder, letting me go home for a well-earned rest.",19,107
1pzffns,,"\*\*\*

Work continued in an undefinable haze of monotony for another year, in which the door changed locations two more times—first to the eastern wall, then back to the southern wall, placing itself directly on top of the moldy stain, covering up its unwelcome slimy presence.",46,108
1pzffns,,"I stayed on task, keeping an eye on the packages, never coming around to find out what secrets they kept, nor did I intend to.",25,109
1pzffns,,"The pay was, as Robert had stated: too good to risk foolish endeavors. Everything was going splendidly, until one day it wasn’t.",22,110
1pzffns,,Not much had changed as I arrived for the night shift that evening. The door had changed positions and was noted by Robert before I took over.,27,111
1pzffns,,He’d kept some leftover pizza saved for me from the dayshift and explained that he’d be relieving me in the morning again because one of our colleagues had called in sick.,31,112
1pzffns,,"I gave monitor number six a glance, and sure enough, the door had relocated to the western wall. Apart from the known anomaly, nothing was amiss.",26,113
1pzffns,,“I’ve only seen it on the western wall a couple of times.,12,114
1pzffns,,"It’s odd, but don’t let it worry you.”

He left me with the pizza and went home for the night, leaving me to watch my next series while the night slowly passed by.",33,115
1pzffns,,"Midnight came and went without incident, and my series had reached its mid-season climax, I wasn’t going to be falling asleep anytime soon.",23,116
1pzffns,,"I opened the window for a smoke, noting how quickly the box had emptied, promising myself I would reduce my cigarette intake in the coming year.",26,117
1pzffns,,"Then, as it had on a few occasions, monitor number six went dark. Thinking the door would change locations again, I paid it little attention.",25,118
1pzffns,,"Minutes would pass, but when the monitor came back to life, something had changed, something that immediately sent a surge of adrenaline rushing through my veins.",26,119
1pzffns,,"“It can’t be,” I mumbled to myself as I stared intently at the monitor, now displaying the door on the western wall, open.",23,120
1pzffns,,"After almost two years on the job, I had seen the door change locations only a handful on times, always closed.",21,121
1pzffns,,"During the same time, nothing of note happened during my shifts. Seeing it open for the first time was a shock on its own.",24,122
1pzffns,,"And though I remained intent on following the strict orders given by Robert, I had to investigate at least a little bit more closely.",24,123
1pzffns,,"Leaving my post in the surveillance room I entered the warehouse, immediately heading for the west wall.",17,124
1pzffns,,"There, in the south-western corner was the door with its accompanying camera hanging above, a red dot blinking, signifying that it was actively recording.",24,125
1pzffns,,"The door itself stood wide open, revealing a narrow hallway that stretched as far as the eye could see, even beyond the boundaries of the warehouse.",26,126
1pzffns,,"It was an impossible construction, yet there I stood, witnessing it with my own eyes. It was an unprecedented situation.",20,127
1pzffns,,"I wasn’t sure whether to ignore the phenomenon and return to my office, or to close the door and maybe attempt to barricade it.",24,128
1pzffns,,"Two, maybe three scenarios loomed in my mind.",8,129
1pzffns,,"One: maybe someone had broken in and entered the room, leaving them in unknown, but immediate danger; two: some unknown entity had broken out, now roaming within the warehouse, putting me in danger; and three: it had just opened because that’s what the door felt like that day.",48,130
1pzffns,,Just another variation of the strange phenomena.,7,131
1pzffns,,"As I stood there contemplating my next move, something called from the depths of the hallway, faint at first, barely enough to overcome the buzzing of the fluorescent lamps lining the warehouse ceiling.",33,132
1pzffns,,"But then it called out again, a voice, begging for help.",11,133
1pzffns,,"“Can anybody hear me?” the voice, that of a man, called out from the hallway, far away, obscured by the dark.",21,134
1pzffns,,"“Hello?” I called back, “I can hear you!”

No response was heard.",12,135
1pzffns,,"I took a few steps closer to the open door, getting a better look at the hallway beyond its threshold.",20,136
1pzffns,,"The ground was lined with hardwood flooring, and the walls were covered in crisscross patterned, yellow wallpaper, partially torn and cracked from years of neglect.",25,137
1pzffns,,"Warm lamps hung from the ceiling, dimly lighting up only a few sections of the hallway until it was left in complete darkness at its end.",26,138
1pzffns,,"For a moment I wondered if I’d hallucinated the calls for help, or if the door itself was purposefully messing with my mind, but after a short break, the voice called out again.",33,139
1pzffns,,"It was getting closer. “Please, I’m begging you. I need help!” he called in desperation.",15,140
1pzffns,,"“Hey, I’m here, can you hear me?” I called into the hallway, again left without a response. “I can’t move. Please, it hurts,” the man cried.",26,141
1pzffns,,"“I need to know where you are. Come on, just answer me.",12,142
1pzffns,,"Tell me you can hear me!” I begged, but the man would not reply to anything I said, he would just keep screaming in agony and begging for a rescue.",30,143
1pzffns,,"“I don’t want to die,” he went on.",8,144
1pzffns,,"I pulled out my phone to call the police, only to be met with a useless piece of equipment not able to garner a single bar of signal.",28,145
1pzffns,,"So, I rushed back into the surveillance room to use the dust-covered landline to call the police, but upon picking it up there wasn’t a dial tone or any indication that it had been active for the past decade.",39,146
1pzffns,,There was nothing I could do to call for help.,10,147
1pzffns,,"I either entered and risked my own safety not to mention losing my job, or I followed the instructions given and ignored the man pleading for help.",27,148
1pzffns,,The decision was quickly made.,5,149
1pzffns,,"Though I appreciate the job, and though I remained fairly certain that the hallway beyond the door held unknown horrors, I wasn’t ready to cower in my office and let an innocent man die.",34,150
1pzffns,,"I quickly jotted down a note, grabbed a heavy flashlight from the utility closet, and went to start my rescue efforts.",21,151
1pzffns,,"“Hello, can you hear me?” I asked, “do you know where you are?”

I had taken one step through the door, my hand still lingering on the door frame as I wasn’t yet entirely ready to proceed without confirmation that the man could actually hear me.",46,152
1pzffns,,"“Hello,” he responded, “can you hear me?”

It would have to suffice, and with that, I proceed to walk down the hallway.",22,153
1pzffns,,No sooner had I taken my first steps inside than I felt a remarkable increase in temperature caused by an uncomfortably heavy atmosphere.,23,154
1pzffns,,"My ears popped from the pressure, causing me to wince from discomfort.",12,155
1pzffns,,"I decided to call out again, hoping that he could finally hear me once I’d stepped deep enough inside. “Where are you?” I asked.",24,156
1pzffns,,"I paused, a sudden sense of dread washing over me.",10,157
1pzffns,,"I turned back, considering whether or not I should leave him be, but the door I had entered through had already closed shut.",23,158
1pzffns,,"I was about to run over and kick the door down, but then the man called out again.",18,159
1pzffns,,"“Where are you?” the voice asked, the desperation turned to almost apathetic exhaustion. “I’m here!” I responded, again getting nothing immediately in return.",23,160
1pzffns,,"Feeling I had made a terrible mistake, I returned to the entrance in an attempt at getting help for the rescue effort, but the door that had closed on me would no longer budge.",34,161
1pzffns,,"It wouldn’t even rattle, as if the door had fused with its surroundings as nothing more than a decorative piece of wood to break the monotony of the wallpaper.",29,162
1pzffns,,"I was sealed inside. I started moving down the hallway, walking straight ahead as I listened intently for the man trying to communicate with me.",25,163
1pzffns,,"Minutes passed, but apart from the lights above starting to dim ever so slightly there was no change in the hallway’s layout.",22,164
1pzffns,,"Step by step, I moved, darkness looming above to the point where I was forced to use my flashlight to see even a few feet ahead.",26,165
1pzffns,,"Then, as I cast the light ahead, the flash was broken by a new set of walls that ended in a T-junction going left and right.",26,166
1pzffns,,"I approached, met with two dimly lit hallways both bending around corners. It wasn’t until I heard another call before I knew where to go.",25,167
1pzffns,,"“I’m here,” the voice called out from hallway stretching in the left direction. “I’m coming!” I responded. I followed, not sure what would meet me at the end.",28,168
1pzffns,,"Then, around the corner, I was met with another set of branching paths. The voice repeated its call and I diligently followed.",22,169
1pzffns,,I was moving around within a seemingly endless maze that was stretching impossibly far beyond the facility grounds.,18,170
1pzffns,,"So, to mark a path leading to the exit, I started to tear pieces of wallpaper off at each junction, revealing a stone wall beneath with a faint red discoloration that felt wet to the touch.",36,171
1pzffns,,"“I’m coming,” the voice said, it’s emotion fading with each call. Something was wrong, something more than the hallway existing under impossible conditions.",23,172
1pzffns,,"Whatever it was that was calling out for me, I wasn’t sure it was human.",15,173
1pzffns,,But as I contemplated my next move I came upon the first open area of the maze—a room lined with the same floor and wallpaper.,25,174
1pzffns,,"It wasn’t particularly large, nothing more than a small room, but definitely a change in the maze’s monotony, shrouded in darkness in the absence of any light source.",28,175
1pzffns,,I swung my flashlight around to get a better bearing of my surroundings when I stumbled upon something hanging from the wall.,22,176
1pzffns,,"It was an odd mass covered in a smooth, drape-like structure plastered to the wall. I took a few steps closer, it was moving, expanding then retracting as if breathing.",30,177
1pzffns,,"Only then did I realize the vaguely humanoid shape it held, hidden behind a pale, pink cover of what could only be flayed and stretched out, human skin, kept alive and fresh by unknown means.",35,178
1pzffns,,"There were arms, legs, even a head with non-distinct facial features in the form of empty eye sockets and a mouth with overgrown skin, moving as if desperately trying to scream, but unable to produce a single audible sound.",39,179
1pzffns,,"I gasped from shock, but the person trapped appeared to be unaware of my presence.",15,180
1pzffns,,"I should have been afraid, and though most of the emotions I felt could be categorized in the same realm as terror, the being fused to the wall elicited no such emotions, but rather an overwhelming sense of pity, as if instinctually knew that what hung before me was the victim and not the monster.",55,181
1pzffns,,"“What happened to you?” I asked, but they didn’t respond.",10,182
1pzffns,,"I then tried to reach them with a slew of questions, asking about their name, how they got here, and if they could hear me, but no response came.",29,183
1pzffns,,"In their condition, I doubted they even knew I was there.",11,184
1pzffns,,"With what I suspected to be the victim’s own skin plastered to the wall, keeping their insides trapped against the wall, there was nothing I could do to free them without killing them, though I briefly wondered if that might be the kinder course of action.",46,185
1pzffns,,"In the end, having no tools but my phone and flashlight, I just reached out and put my hand on them, hoping to bring them a brief sense of comfort.",30,186
1pzffns,,"“I’m so sorry,” I whispered.",5,187
1pzffns,,"But as I stood there in disbelief, I recalled that a voice had called out for help, and if it wasn’t whoever was trapped on the wall, someone, or something else had lured me in there.",36,188
1pzffns,,"Then, the voice called out again.",6,189
1pzffns,,"“What happened to you?” the voice called out, now completely rid of any human emotion, letting its mask slip as it again repeated my own words back to me.",29,190
1pzffns,,"I turned to run, only to realize that the path I’d come through no longer existed.",16,191
1pzffns,,"The hallway had collapsed into itself in a twisted amalgamation of wood, stone, revealing raw flesh hidden beneath the thin, stone façade as the maze broke itself apart.",28,192
1pzffns,,"“I’m so sorry,” the voice called, now with a loud, guttural cry that reverberated through the room.",17,193
1pzffns,,"With the floor twisting around, I swiftly lost my footing and fell on my back, dropping my flashlight in the process.",21,194
1pzffns,,"As I lay there, I could only witness as the room started to contract, tearing itself apart in an effort to swallow me.",23,195
1pzffns,,"In the process, the lump of human fused to the wall was consumed, crushing the person trapped within, their bones shattering, their organs ripped to shreds.",26,196
1pzffns,,"I tried to crawl backwards, leaving the room into another hallway that led deeper into the maze.",17,197
1pzffns,,"Once on semi-solid ground, I shot to my feet and ran blindly down the hallway, praying I could find a path that looped around, leading me back towards the exit.",30,198
1pzffns,,"But instead of finding any diverging path, I was once again led into another room, this one far larger than the one before.",23,199
1pzffns,,"No sooner had I entered the room than the hallway behind me closed shut. Wherever I now found myself, I was trapped there.",23,200
1pzffns,,"But, as dire as the situation was, the room appeared intact, not actively trying to eat me.",17,201
1pzffns,,"Without my flashlight, I pulled out my phone to light the way, only to realize that it had shattered during the escape—without it, I was left with little more than a lighter to light up the path ahead.",38,202
1pzffns,,"The fire of the lighter was weak, not able to hit any of the room’s four walls nor the ceiling above.",21,203
1pzffns,,"I stretched my arm up as high as it would reach, but above loomed nothing but a black void, stretching for a seemingly infinite distance up into nothingness.",28,204
1pzffns,,"With no other options left, I started walking forwards into the darkness, praying for a miraculous escape—instead, I found something that sent shivers down my spine, an abomination that couldn’t have been conjured by my own wildest nightmares.",38,205
1pzffns,,"Before me hung a mass of flesh, similar to the one I’d found before, with pale skin stretched across it, but far larger, and with no human features that could be discerned.",32,206
1pzffns,,"A large hole was revealed in its center mass, a mouth with rotten teeth of different sizes. I froze, unable to move, not even able to form a coherent thought.",30,207
1pzffns,,"The monstrosity before me remained inactive, but its mere presence had rendered me paralyzed.",14,208
1pzffns,,"“What is your name?” the thing asked in a loud, broken voice that echoed throughout the large room. I didn’t respond at first, still awestruck by the sight.",28,209
1pzffns,,"A thought had begun to form in the back of my mind as I finally began to understand, but it was too vague.",23,210
1pzffns,,"The monster needed something from me, that was the only reason I was still alive. “Who are you?” the monster repeated.",21,211
1pzffns,,"“My name is Anthony River,” I said, “what do you want from me?”

The room fell silent for a moment, as if the mass of flesh analyzed my question.",29,212
1pzffns,,"“What do you want from me?” it repeated back to me. “What the hell are you?” I let out in almost a scream, a mixture of anger and fear.",29,213
1pzffns,,"“I am…” it began before trailing off. “I am the memory of all of mankind. I am what remains.”

“What do you want?”

It didn’t respond.",26,214
1pzffns,,"Again, the temperature increased, but the creature didn’t attack. It waited for me to speak. “What happened to the people that came in here?” I asked.",26,215
1pzffns,,"“We are the same,” it responded. “What does that mean?” I asked. “We are the same,” it said again, “you will join us.”

“No,” I meekly responded.",27,216
1pzffns,,"With that, the ground started to move again beneath my feet, pulling and shifting in an attempt at making me fall.",21,217
1pzffns,,"With the entrance closed, I started to move towards one of the other walls, still out of sight in the darkness.",21,218
1pzffns,,"But with one misstep in the moving structure, I was sent pummeling to the ground, almost knocked unconscious in the process.",21,219
1pzffns,,"I could feel myself sinking into the shifting floor, the wood and stone giving way to flesh as it began to wrap around my body.",25,220
1pzffns,,"A sharp pain shot through my chest as the floor constricted, as if something hard and small was pushing against it.",21,221
1pzffns,,"I reached for my jacket to find the hip flask that had belonged to my predecessor, still filled with alcohol.",20,222
1pzffns,,"Unable to claw myself out, I went for the only strategy I could think of to avoid becoming one with the collective flesh.",23,223
1pzffns,,"I poured the alcohol out around me, grabbed the lighter, and lit it on fire.",15,224
1pzffns,,"Within a split second, a bright light formed on the flesh riddled floor as the alcohol combusted, spreading the flame across the dried, hardwood floor, quickly reaching the wallpaper which immediately followed suit.",33,225
1pzffns,,"The flesh retracted, letting out a horrific screech as its muscles and nerves burned, producing thick, black smoke in the progress.",21,226
1pzffns,,"The walls retracted as best they could, revealing an exit. I shot to my feet, the floor to preoccupied by the fire to consume me.",25,227
1pzffns,,"I started running, blind from the smoke, unable to breathe.",10,228
1pzffns,,"Yet, even as the oxygen was pulled into the flames, the screeching continued, letting out a thousand agonized screams in different languages as each and every one of the victims of the flesh burned.",34,229
1pzffns,,"Using the marks in the wallpaper as a guide, I tried to make my way back to the entrance, but with the fire spreading and the smoke thickening, I couldn’t see, much less breathe.",34,230
1pzffns,,"My vision began to turn blurry, and my muscles weakened.",10,231
1pzffns,,"I felt my legs give in under me, and with a clouded mind, I fell to the floor, passing out before I could make an escape.",26,232
1pzffns,,"There I lay, the smoke above me, barely a thin layer of oxygen to keep me just on the brink of consciousness.",22,233
1pzffns,,"My thoughts lingered on the fleshy amalgamation in the maze. I wondered how many had succumbed to its trap, and where it had come from.",25,234
1pzffns,,"I wondered if the fire would kill it, or just slow it down as I died, giving it a much-needed respite before luring in its next victim.",27,235
1pzffns,,"I wanted to stand up, but my body was too weak, too wounded. Then I felt something grab onto me, and I was too weak to fight back.",28,236
1pzffns,,"But rather than feeling myself getting pulled down into the ground, something lifted me up, and the grip wasn’t rough and hard like the maze had been, but soft and comforting.",31,237
1pzffns,,"I looked up, seeing a familiar face glaring down at me. “Stay with me!” Robert yelled as he pulled me away. “How did you…” I began before finally losing consciousness.",30,238
1pzffns,,"\*\*\*

I woke up on the floor of the warehouse, Robert standing above me, and the sound of sirens blaring loudly outside.",22,239
1pzffns,,"The door I entered through no longer lingered, having erased itself from the wall alongside any evidence of the fire.",20,240
1pzffns,,"“You’re going to be alright,” Robert promised, “it’s over.”

Robert looked equally pissed off and afraid, and though I didn’t quite understand how he’d found me within the maze, I’d never been happier to see a fellow human being.",39,241
1pzffns,,“Do you realize stupid that was?” he asked. I could only respond with a weak nod.,16,242
1pzffns,,"“We could have died, both of us.”

“I’m sorry,” I managed to get out, barely a whisper.",17,243
1pzffns,,"A squad of the fire brigade entered the warehouse, donning fire-resistant uniforms, gas masks and oxygen tanks.",17,244
1pzffns,,"And though the hairs on my body had been zinged away, and my face was covered in soot, the danger had already passed, leaving the rescue team confused and annoyed.",30,245
1pzffns,,"Nevertheless, with low oxygen saturation and second-degree burns covering my body, I was brought to the hospital where I was held over the course of two weeks while I recovered.",30,246
1pzffns,,"No one came to visit during the first week, not even Robert. I tried to call into work using the hospital phone, but no one answered.",26,247
1pzffns,,"It wasn’t until the second week before one of the company supervisors visited to inform me that following a thorough investigation that I had been fired, and that I was no longer welcome on company properties.",36,248
1pzffns,,"No questions were asked about my experiences during that night, nor would they give me the chance to explain myself.",20,249
1pzffns,,"I asked to speak to Robert, needing at least one person to understand what had happened, and why I had chosen to walk into the maze.",26,250
1pzffns,,"Again, my request was denied, though they did inform me that Robert was put on administrative leave pending investigation, and without any current contact information, I’ve been unable to get ahold of him.",33,251
1pzffns,,"To this day, he hasn’t made any attempts to contact me, but I keep waiting for the phone to ring.",20,252
1pzffns,,"I just need to talk about this with someone that understands, and above all, I need to thank him for saving [my life.](",23,253

1pzd82d,,"Believe me, the urge to flee was there - but it was overpowered, not for seconds but for long minutes. Too long.",22,2
1pzd82d,,Enough for whatever was down there to enjoy a cup of tea before popping up for a quick meal.,19,3
1pzd82d,,"The creature was said to be no larger than a man, smaller even. And, importantly, dormant.",16,4
1pzd82d,,"The awakening was not to occur for centuries, when what was left of me was ravaged by maggots.",18,5
1pzd82d,,"But then there was the dreadful, muffled sounds of tapping, rapping, ticking; the raspy, laboured breathing which escaped the basement as though there was no foundation of wood and concrete between us.",32,6
1pzd82d,,"The rebirthing had begun. A small voice of courage asserted itself, and I reclaimed control of my body.",18,7
1pzd82d,,"I went first to the rifle, recalling the tales of the beast’s power.",13,8
1pzd82d,,"Very little had remained of the last fellow, scattered about the basement floor, and he was better armed than me. The ammunition shrunk in my hands.",26,9
1pzd82d,,My resolution the day prior that I would have no such end seemed laughable now. I knew that the creature’s awakening could be neither stalled nor stifled.,27,10

1pzd82d,,"The creature’s dissonant, almost musical wheezing threatened to stopper my heart before its infamous stalagmite claws had the chance.",19,12
1pzd82d,,"I steadily poured out the contents of the first tankard, then the second, then the third.",16,13
1pzd82d,,They disappeared beneath the door and hopefully down the steps into the darkness in which the creature writhed away centuries of sleep.,22,14
1pzd82d,,"In its harsh effusions, I detected pain, even breathlessness, and a hope sprouted in me.",15,15
1pzd82d,,Perhaps something had gone wrong with the awakening - one of the ritual pieces was out of place - and the creature had been birthed only to die from some technical failure.,32,16
1pzd82d,,"But hope was dangerous, so I discarded it. The last of the petroleum dripped from the third tankard, and I allowed myself a sigh of relief.",26,17
1pzd82d,,"I threw some clothing and prewrapped victuals out the window to land safely on the soft, cold grass - enough to make the slow passage to the next town.",29,18
1pzd82d,,"I winced violently at an agonised shriek from the creature which startled the horse outside to a panicked whinny, and almost froze me once more. ‘Stay, Suzy,’ I said.",29,19

1pzd82d,,"The giant flame flickered in Suzy’s fearful eyes, and again I ran my hands across her neck, quieting her frightened blowing.",21,28
1pzd82d,,"By then, the creature below the house must have been burning. It mattered not what it was made from, for flame was the Lord’s equalizer.",25,29
1pzd82d,,"It’s true we’re commanded to use it sparingly, but this was such an occasion that called for it, I thought. To stay an unholy demon not of His creation.",29,30
1pzd82d,,"I released a long, deep sigh I had held captive since waking. I closed my eyes and focused on slowing the resurging drumming of my heart.",26,31

1pzd82d,,"I steadied myself and pulled the rifle from my back. The creature, as though healing from its injuries, drew itself to a less staggering gait, and approached with greater speed.",30,35
1pzd82d,,It unleashed another blood curdling shriek that filled every space of the night air. It rejoiced in finding its prey.,20,36
1pzd82d,,"The horse beside me cantered on the spot, pulling at her reins, urging flight. She let out another panicked whinny.",20,37

There were two bullets, and two of us.",27,38

1pzcsta,,"""There's one thing they don't tell you. Ever since then, every time someone really interferes with the mechanism... something happens. A sudden illness, an accident, a loss.",27,23
1pzcsta,,"Nothing that can be proven, of course. Nothing that appears in a report. “Are you trying to scare me before I even start?” I tried to joke. He didn't laugh.",30,24
1pzcsta,,"""I just want you to know that people here don't take this clock lightly. Nor the legends. He left me the keys and left.",24,25
1pzcsta,,"That first night, I went up alone. The noise of the square faded with each step.",16,26
1pzcsta,,"When I closed the wooden door behind me, the sound of the city died away. All that remained was a metallic, deep, constant beat. It wasn't a ticking.",28,27
1pzcsta,,"It was slower, deeper. It sounded like restrained breathing. I turned on my flashlight. The interior of the tower was a huge skeleton of iron and wood.",27,28
1pzcsta,,"Blackened gears, wheels like rusty ribs, axles embedded in stone. Above, motionless figures seemed to watch from small secret windows.",20,29
1pzcsta,,"The air smelled of old oil, dust, and something I had only noticed in churches that had been closed for too long: a mixture of dampness, dead incense, and wilted flowers.",31,30
1pzcsta,,"The clock had been malfunctioning: running fast, stopping briefly, “skipping” seconds.",11,31
1pzcsta,,I had read the technical records at the hotel; the official explanation spoke of wear and tear and possible errors in previous adjustments. It seemed reasonable.,26,32
1pzcsta,,"I believed in that: in metal, in precision. Not in curses.",11,33
1pzcsta,,"And yet, as I climbed toward the heart of the mechanism, the story of the blinded master came back to my mind.",22,34
1pzcsta,,"I imagined him climbing the same stairs, proud, convinced that his work would make him immortal.",16,35
1pzcsta,,"And then coming down without sight, guided by other people's hands, blindfolded or with empty eyes. The back of my neck went cold. I shook my head, annoyed with myself.",30,36
1pzcsta,,"As I climbed the steps of the tower, the atmosphere became oppressive. The smell was unbearable: old oil, dust... and something sweet and rotten that shouldn't have been there.",29,37
1pzcsta,,"For the first time, I felt something I hate to admit: the premonition that what awaited me up there did not entirely belong to the world I thought I knew.",30,38
1pzcsta,,"Damn it! I tripped over a step I shouldn't have seen, although I could have sworn it wasn't there. I finally reached the center of the machinery. I was alone.",30,39
1pzcsta,,"Or so I thought. That's when I heard the first voice. “Don't touch anything.”

I stood still. The voice came from very close behind me.",25,40
1pzcsta,,"I turned so quickly that I almost tripped over a cogwheel. There was no one there. Only the immense mechanism, breathing in its own way.",25,41
1pzcsta,,"I swallowed hard, aware of the absurdity: I was tired from the trip, influenced by the stories and by an official who was too prone to drama.",27,42
1pzcsta,,"The brain creates echoes, I told myself. I felt ridiculously scared for someone who had only come to check the gears. I forced myself to work.",26,43
1pzcsta,,"The first few hours were almost reassuring. I found what I expected to find: a worn axle, a loose part, a small crack in one of the main wheels.",29,44
1pzcsta,,Nothing that a modern workshop couldn't fix. Nothing that justified such hysteria. Until I saw the engravings.,17,45
1pzcsta,,"They were on a piece of metal that, in theory, no one should look at closely except during a major repair. Names. Dozens of names.",25,46
1pzcsta,,"Each one accompanied by a date. Some were centuries old, written in ancient script. Others were recent, from decades that I could still remember in color.",26,47
1pzcsta,,One of them caught my attention because I recognized the surname; I had seen it in a restoration report from the early nineties.,23,48
1pzcsta,,"The technician responsible died the following year in an absurd accident, I vaguely remembered from a side note. I continued reading names. Dates. Names. The last one was incomplete.",29,49
1pzcsta,,Just a first name and an initial; someone had been interrupted before finishing. It was at that moment that the clock stopped. It wasn't a malfunction.,26,50
1pzcsta,,"When a machine really breaks down, you notice it: it groans, it brakes badly, it makes a dirty noise. That wasn't the case here. It was a clean pause. Absolute.",30,51
1pzcsta,,Silence fell over the tower like a coffin lid. The figures stopped vibrating. The bells fell silent.,17,52
1pzcsta,,"And I felt—in a physical, almost painful way—how the city held its breath on the other side of the stone. I heard the second voice.",25,53
1pzcsta,,"“One is missing.”

This time it wasn't a whisper. It sounded clear, sharp, right behind me. I turned around. And I saw her.",23,54
1pzcsta,,"Tall, excessively thin, wrapped in a dark cloak that seemed to absorb what little light there was.",17,55
1pzcsta,,"She had no face, or I couldn't see it; it was like looking at an absence, a hole in reality with a human form.",24,56
1pzcsta,,"It wasn't a shadow, it wasn't smoke. But it wasn't a body as we understand it either.",17,57
1pzcsta,,"It was something earlier, inevitable, like the moment just before a machine starts up. I didn't move. I don't even know if I could.",24,58
1pzcsta,,"“This clock doesn't measure time,” she said without opening her cloak, without a mouth to articulate words. “It holds it.",20,59
1pzcsta,,"It keeps it tied to this city so that everything continues.”

Her voice didn't sound in my ears, but inside my skull.",22,60
1pzcsta,,"“Every century, every decade, every cycle,” she continued, “demands balance.",10,61
1pzcsta,,"Nothing moves forward for free.”

I felt the absurd temptation to look at the engraved names, but I forced myself not to. I understood.",24,62
1pzcsta,,"“I just repair mechanisms.”

“No,” he replied. “You repair the cage of the world.”

The metal groaned. It was a long, deep, almost animalistic sound. The wheels shook without moving.",30,63
1pzcsta,,"I felt my hand resting on the side of something enormous that was enduring an impossible effort. “It stops when an offering is missing,” he said.",26,64
1pzcsta,,"I heard myself ask, in a voice that didn't seem to be mine:

“What kind of offering?”

""Life. Memory. Sight. Blood. Something it can devour to keep turning. Before, kings.",30,65
1pzcsta,,"After, craftsmen. Now... whoever touches it. I thought of the legend of the master clockmaker.",15,66
1pzcsta,,Of his eyes being gouged out so that he could never create anything like it again. I had always heard it as a warning against human envy.,27,67
1pzcsta,,"There, in front of that presence, I understood another interpretation: they did not blind him to punish him, but to pay him. So that the clock could continue.",28,68
1pzcsta,,I looked at the list of names. I understood. Every major repair had come at a price.,17,69
1pzcsta,,"Every time someone meddled too much with that mechanism, the clock took its toll. And now it was looking at me. “I'm not going to do it,” I said.",29,70
1pzcsta,,"I wanted it to sound firm. It didn't sound firm. “Then it won't move,” it replied. And the night stopped moving forward. I felt it before I saw it.",29,71
1pzcsta,,"A weight, a new density in the air. The temperature dropped, but not like when you open a window.",19,72
1pzcsta,,"It was a cold that came from time itself, from the idea of time. I looked through a small crack toward the square. The streetlights were still on.",28,73
1pzcsta,,People were moving. But something was wrong. Their steps seemed too slow. The lights from their cell phones left trails that took a long time to fade.,27,74
1pzcsta,,"Cigarette smoke hung in the air, twisting with grotesque slowness. The figure spoke again. “If you don't pay, time will stop here. First minutes. Then hours. Then years.",28,75
1pzcsta,,"This city will be trapped. It will rot standing up.”

I thought of Jiri. Of the tourists. Of the people sleeping, unaware.",22,76
1pzcsta,,"Of all those who, the next day, would look at their watches as if they were a charming spectacle of mechanical dolls. “What do you want?” I asked.",28,77
1pzcsta,,I knew the answer before he moved. The figure pointed at my eyes. I felt a sharp sting in my eye sockets. I remembered the master watchmaker.,27,78
1pzcsta,,"I remembered all the versions of the legend. Blind, mad, dead. I took a deep breath.",16,79
1pzcsta,,"I've never suffered from panic attacks, but at that moment I discovered what it was like not to be able to fill my lungs. I closed my eyelids. I accepted.",30,80
1pzcsta,,"There were no knives. There were no hands. Just a brutal pull inward. A white burn, then black, then nothing. I lost my balance and grabbed onto a cold shaft.",30,81
1pzcsta,,"I heard my own scream, far away, as if it were coming from another floor of the tower. Then the clock started ticking again.",24,82
1pzcsta,,"The sound of the mechanism filled the space with a new, voracious force. The wheels loosened, light, grateful. Above, I heard the figures moving.",24,83
1pzcsta,,"The bells rang out in the night, louder than ever. And the city went on. I don't know how much time passed after that.",24,84
1pzcsta,,"When I opened my eyes, I saw nothing. No shadows, no light. Just a compact, uniform darkness. I heard voices. Hurried footsteps. Hands touching my shoulder.",26,85
1pzcsta,,"They asked me if I was okay. Someone said my name, with an accent, Michael, Michael. Another voice, perhaps Jiri's, ordered them to call an ambulance. I smiled.",28,86
1pzcsta,,"It's funny: at that moment, I didn't feel afraid. I felt relief. At the hospital, they talked about an inexplicable condition, a possible neuropathy, additional tests.",26,87
1pzcsta,,"They ran tests on me, bombarded me with lights I couldn't see. They wrapped my head in buzzing machines. They said long words that I won't repeat.",27,88
1pzcsta,,"In the end, they translated it into something understandable:

“We don't know why it happened,” they told me, “but the injury is irreversible.”

They didn't insist on the causes.",29,89
1pzcsta,,"Neither did I. Days later, Jiri came to see me. He sat down next to the bed. He smelled of stale tobacco and rain.",24,90
1pzcsta,,"He didn't say anything for a while. He just breathed. I listened to the monitor, the slow drip of an IV, the footsteps in the hallway.",26,91
1pzcsta,,"“The clock is working perfectly,” he finally said. “It hadn't worked like that in years.”

I noticed a nauseating mixture of pride and resentment in the way he spoke.",29,92
1pzcsta,,"“They've been checking the machinery,” he added. “One of the technicians found something curious.”

Pause. “There's a new name engraved on the metal. Very recent.",25,93
1pzcsta,,"Dated this week.”

My throat closed up. He didn't need to say it, but he did. “Michael Turner,” he whispered. “And the year.”

I didn't want to know any more.",30,94
1pzcsta,,"They offered to keep my open return ticket, but I insisted on going back.",14,95
1pzcsta,,"Before I left, I asked for one thing: that no one talk to me about the clock.",17,96
1pzcsta,,"That they not describe how it had been left, or what the press was saying, or if people had noticed anything strange those days. I told them I wasn't interested.",30,97
1pzcsta,,"I lied. I'm interested in every detail. But I know that if I hear it, I won't be able to keep pretending that this was just an accident.",28,98
1pzcsta,,"Now I'm back home. Learning to move in the dark. I hear clocks I used to ignore. The ones in the kitchen, the living room, the hallway.",27,99
1pzcsta,,"They all seem louder since then. Then I know it's him. The clock. I can't see it, but I can feel it. It beats. It breathes. It waits.",28,100
1pzcsta,,"Because for it to turn, someone always has to pay. And the legends, believe me, have never lied completely. Today I'm still alive, yes.",24,101
1pzcsta,,But I live in a darkness that doesn't belong to this world.,12,102
1pzcsta,,"And when, in the middle of the night, I hear that metallic heartbeat that doesn't come from any wall, but from some remote place that may not even be on Earth, I know it's still there.",36,103
1pzcsta,,Watching me. Reminding me. Because I didn't repair a clock. I served something that serves itself.,16,104
1pzcsta,,"And if you ever travel to Prague and the clock stops, don't pray for it to start moving again. Don't invoke its mercy. It has none.",26,105
1pzcsta,,"That artifact does not belong to man. And every time it turns, it does so with blood.",17,106
1pzcsta,,Just remember this: what continues to beat up there is not at our service. It is we who continue to be at its service.,24,107
1pzbyjb,New to the Neighborhood,"Mount Harmon is where I have lived my whole life, where I tell this tale from my childhood.",18,0
1pzbyjb,,"Its one of these small towns in New England where everybody knows each other, the kind of place that looks like it hasn’t changed in fifty years.",27,1
1pzbyjb,,"The biggest attraction is the gas station, where most people buy their groceries as well as gossip about the residents. You get the idea, there’s not much going on here.",30,2
1pzbyjb,,"Anyways, it was really weird when a new neighbor showed up. Not a person mind you, an entire house. It just showed up out of nowhere.",26,3
1pzbyjb,,"Mrs.Danforth was the first one to notice, naturally, as it was suddenly right next door to her.",17,4
1pzbyjb,,"She called Sheriff Franklin, and once people saw the sheriff heading over towards her road, everybody knew something was going on up there.",23,5
1pzbyjb,,"Vinny, my older brother was the one who told me about it.",12,6
1pzbyjb,,"“Ricky, Franklin just rolled up the Danforth road, you want to come check it out?”

I did, it beat whatever mind numbing thing I had been doing.",27,7
1pzbyjb,,"We grabbed our bikes and made our way up the hill. My brother and I figured one of the Danforths had died, they were quite old.",26,8
1pzbyjb,,"“Hey, where did that come from?” I nearly crashed into Vinny as he braked abruptly, seeing the house that had never been there before.",24,9
1pzbyjb,,We both sat with our mouth’s hanging open.,8,10
1pzbyjb,,"The sheriff’s cruiser was parked on the other side of the road, the Danforths stood talking with him on their porch, all three peering at the new house in fear.",30,11
1pzbyjb,,"It was large, three stories, with a long curved driveway that lead to a barn beside it.",17,12
1pzbyjb,,"Despite being a new structure, the house itself looked like it had been sitting there for about two-hundred years.",19,13
1pzbyjb,,"The paint was deteriorating, the porch sagged and the upstairs windows looked like they were cracked.",16,14
1pzbyjb,,"We watched the sheriff go timidly up to the end of the driveway, ducking low and trying to look through the windows.",22,15
1pzbyjb,,"By now more people had joined us, at what seemed like a safe distance from it. Other kids from the middle school gathered around us where we had parked.",29,16
1pzbyjb,,A few speculated on what the house could be.,9,17
1pzbyjb,,"“Its a ghost house, no doubt,” Donny Maron said, his confidence selling his theory to a few other onlookers who nodded in agreement.",23,18
1pzbyjb,,"“Nah, it can’t be a ghost house, its solid, plain to see as you and I!” Tim Desmond pitched his opinion in.",22,19
1pzbyjb,,"“Yeah, well, then how did it get here?” Donny asked, folding his arms and wrinkling his nose at Tim. They glared at each other.",24,20
1pzbyjb,,"“Maybe it was invisible!” Tim finally retaliated, folding his arms as well. “That’s stupid, then somebody would have crashed into it!”

Their debate got rather heated.",26,21
1pzbyjb,,It seemed that no one really knew what to do about it. Franklin had Deputy Reevis bring down caution tape and road blocks.,23,22
1pzbyjb,,"It wasn’t reassuring to see the way they kept a close watch on the house the whole time, neither daring to put the tape on the structure.",27,23
1pzbyjb,,"They closed down the entire road instead, keeping everyone from getting near it. Not that anyone dared to. A town meeting was scheduled to decide how to proceed.",28,24
1pzbyjb,,"For the first time in my life I wished I was allowed to attend, opting to listen crouched down by the windows instead.",23,25
1pzbyjb,,"We weren’t the only kids who had made their way to hear the outcome, Donny and Tim were there, along with about half of our middle school.",27,26
1pzbyjb,,"The meeting was long, involved a lot of shouting, caused tension between families, and in the process gave all us middle schoolers reason to pick on each other for where our families aligned themselves.",34,27
1pzbyjb,,"It was a thrilling thing to be spying on, in other words.",12,28
1pzbyjb,,"They ended up forming two sides, one that thought the house should be demolished, while the other half said it should be left alone.",24,29
1pzbyjb,,"There were various reasonings for either side. I was curious how our parents would vote, not hearing their voices arguing along with the rest.",24,30
1pzbyjb,,"As people started to make their way to the doors we all fled, trying to act like we had all been playing pick up ball.",25,31
1pzbyjb,,Grim faced parents called on us to go home.,9,32
1pzbyjb,,"“So, how are you going to vote, Pop?” Vinny couldn’t wait any longer when we crossed the front threshold, badgering my father before he had slipped his shoes off.",29,33
1pzbyjb,,He looked at Vinny and I and simply pointed upstairs. This was his way of letting us know he would be talking to our mother in private.,27,34
1pzbyjb,,"We ran up the steps, both shoving each other for the best spot at the top of the stairs to hear down into the living room.",26,35
1pzbyjb,,"As usual, Vinny won and cupped his ear. I found myself holding my breath, eager to hear what my father had to say.",23,36
1pzbyjb,,“It would probably be safer to leave it be…” my mother decided to start the conversation after a long spell of silence.,22,37
1pzbyjb,,"“How do we know it isn’t dangerous keeping it up?”

The discussion was less exciting than we had hoped, but it ended with my father saying he thought it should be demolished, and if it came to it, he would help take it down.",44,38
1pzbyjb,,"My mother said she wished he wouldn’t. We had a quiet dinner that evening, our parents sent us to bed earlier than usual after.",24,39
1pzbyjb,,"I tapped on Vinny’s door when I heard snoring coming from the master bedroom. He let me in, shutting the door quickly.",22,40
1pzbyjb,,"I could already tell he was eager to discuss something. “We should go look at it, right now!” he whispered excitedly.",21,41
1pzbyjb,,"I wasn’t entirely surprised to hear him say this, but my stomach was already filling with butterflies at the prospect.",20,42
1pzbyjb,,"“Vin, what if we get caught?” I was trying to reason, the argument was shaky though. We were seasoned veterans at leaving our house at night.",26,43
1pzbyjb,,"Vinny scoffed, pulling his sweatshirt over his head. He started tying his laces. It seemed I had little chance of persuading him not to go.",25,44
1pzbyjb,,"“Don’t tell me you’re going to wuss out?” he looked at my nervous posture. I bit my lip, I knew it was a bad idea.",25,45
1pzbyjb,,"I didn’t want him to go by himself though. “No, I’ll get ready,” I said, regretting it immediately.",18,46
1pzbyjb,,"I went back to my room and got dressed, then met Vinny by the backdoor. We grabbed our bikes out of the yard and pedaled up the hill.",28,47
1pzbyjb,,"Vinny was really eager to get there, going extra fast. I, on the other hand, felt like each pedal was putting me closer to certain death.",26,48
1pzbyjb,,"Once we got to the roadblock Vinny parked his bike next to it and left me behind, making his way up to the driveway. I glanced up at the house.",30,49
1pzbyjb,,"In the dark it looked all the more menacing, hostile even. I shuddered, hoping that we wouldn’t be staying long.",20,50
1pzbyjb,,"Vinny had his toes at the bottom of the driveway, staring up at the house with a longing look. “This is as close as anybody has gotten…” he said softly.",30,51
1pzbyjb,,"He was right, not even our sheriff had been where he was. I couldn’t bring myself to stand next to him. Something primal told me not to.",27,52
1pzbyjb,,"He stared at the house for a long time, inching his toes a bit further into the driveway every now and then.",22,53
1pzbyjb,,"Once his heels were completely across, I got nervous. “Vinny, let’s go, its late. This isn’t a good idea.",19,54
1pzbyjb,,"We have school tomorrow!”

He finally turned away from the house, addressing me with disdain. “Fine. But we’re going to come back.",22,55
1pzbyjb,,"This is important stuff man, it’s like we’re exploring the moon!”

The next day the school was abuzz, the only topic was the house.",24,56
1pzbyjb,,Even the teachers got into our debates. The votes were to be tallied the next day to see what to do with the house itself.,25,57
1pzbyjb,,"After last bell, I made my way over to the bike rack to meet Vinny, unsurprised to find him bragging about our midnight excursion to Donny and a few other eighth graders.",32,58
1pzbyjb,,"“Is he full of shit or what?” Donny asked when he saw me coming up. I shook my head. “No, we really went to see it,” I replied.",28,59
1pzbyjb,,Donny spit on the ground and addressed Vinny. “I call bullshit. There’s no way you went into the drive.,19,60
1pzbyjb,,"Let’s see you do it again.”

Vinny rose to the challenge, eager to prove to Donny he wasn’t afraid. “Okay, Donny, meet me tonight, I’ll show you.",27,61
1pzbyjb,,"Be there at midnight,” he told him. That night I waited for Vinny to signal to me that it was time.",21,62
1pzbyjb,,When he came to get me I tried to convince him to bail. He wasn’t having it.,17,63
1pzbyjb,,"“No way, and have Donny tell everyone I was too afraid to meet him? Uh-uh!",15,64
1pzbyjb,,"Plus, what if they bulldoze it down, don’t you want to be able to say that you were brave enough to go up to it?”

It really didn’t matter to me, I was only feeling dread at the prospect of returning.",41,65
1pzbyjb,,"Again, I found myself being dragged along, not wanting Vinny to be there alone in case Donny didn’t show.",19,66
1pzbyjb,,As we got to the roadblock I could see Donny’s silhouette and somebody else parked beside him. As we got closer I realized it was Tim.,26,67
1pzbyjb,,"“I told him we were going, he wanted to come too,” Donny gestured to Tim. I was kind of glad to have more people around this time.",27,68
1pzbyjb,,I hadn’t liked the way Vinny was looking at the house last time. He made me think I might have to drag him away from it.,26,69
1pzbyjb,,"“The more the merrier, eh? Alright Donny, watch and learn,” Vinny strode toward the driveway nonchalantly as we watched from the road.",22,70
1pzbyjb,,I held my breath as Vinny went even further than he had the night before.,15,71
1pzbyjb,,"He went up the drive about twelve paces, then turned around, facing us with a huge grin on his face.",20,72
1pzbyjb,,"Tim clapped sarcastically, Vinny took a bow and ran back over to us.",13,73
1pzbyjb,,"“Alright, so I guess you’re not so full of shit,” Donny relented, “But, I can do better than that.”

He marched up to the driveway, taking a nervous glance at the house before he ran up just ahead of where Vinny had stopped.",43,74
1pzbyjb,,"Tim clapped again, Donny flipped us off before he came back over. My stomach was churning, feeling that we were really pushing our luck.",24,75
1pzbyjb,,"Vinny was pissed that Donny had outdone him, saying he would do better than that.",15,76
1pzbyjb,,"I begged him not to, making myself look like a wimp, but I was finally able to pry him away.",20,77
1pzbyjb,,"“Hey, Vinny, maybe leave the baby at home next time!” Donny said, climbing on his bike and taking off down the hill with Tim.",24,78
1pzbyjb,,"Vinny gave me a lot of shit the whole way back, saying that I had cost him a victory. I didn’t care, their new rivalry made me feel nauseous.",29,79
1pzbyjb,,"I knew nothing good could come of it. The next day we had the outcome of the vote at noon, which ended in dramatic fashion.",25,80
1pzbyjb,,"Mrs.Danforth had begged the town to leave the structure up, saying she thought demolishing it would only release whatever was held within onto the world.",25,81
1pzbyjb,,"She shocked everybody by saying that they were moving out, going a county over and leaving their house for the last fifty years, and the town they had lived in their whole lives.",33,82
1pzbyjb,,"About twenty people pitched in to help them load up, then they were gone, Mrs.Danforth weeping as they rode away.",20,83
1pzbyjb,,"The only thing this meant to Vinny was that he could now venture to the mysterious house whenever he felt like it, without anybody around to see him.",28,84
1pzbyjb,,He and Donny upped the ante when we all met up to play the game again.,16,85
1pzbyjb,,They had a wooden chip that was painted blue on one side and red on the other.,17,86
1pzbyjb,,"After they argued over who got to pick the color first, Donny ended up with red and Vinny with blue.",20,87
1pzbyjb,,"They would place the chip at their feet, leaving their color right side up until the other person came to pick it up and walk it further.",27,88
1pzbyjb,,The first day we used the chip Vinny made it halfway to the barn.,14,89
1pzbyjb,,"Donny claimed he had something to do when it was his turn, opting to call it quits at that point.",20,90
1pzbyjb,,"Every time we went he would go a little further, able to beat Donny by a few feet. Tim and I were there only to be witnesses, it seemed.",29,91
1pzbyjb,,"Some word circulated about the game they were playing, but even though Vinny was prone to bragging, he realized if he confirmed it, somebody would put a stop to it.",30,92
1pzbyjb,,"Donny was just as tight lipped, surprisingly. The game continued, Vinny now only a few steps away from the barn.",20,93
1pzbyjb,,"Every piece of me told me to stop him, to prevent him from going any further, but some morbid curiosity would overcome me, wondering if my brother may just prove to us the house was ordinary after all.",38,94
1pzbyjb,,As he smugly placed the chip down and strode back to us Donny was scowling. He looked like he was ready to prove something.,24,95
1pzbyjb,,"“Alright, Vin, get your notebook out for this one!” he taunted.",11,96
1pzbyjb,,"He jogged to where the chip was resting, but unlike they had done up to that point, he tossed it up towards the front porch.",25,97
1pzbyjb,,It landed with the blue side up just below the steps. Tim and I exchanged looks. Vinny’s expression didn’t change.,20,98
1pzbyjb,,"Donny chuckled as he walked back, bumping into Vinny on purpose. “I changed the rules, whoever’s side it lands on has to walk to that spot now,” he said.",29,99
1pzbyjb,,"Vinny looked like he was going into war as he made his way toward the chip. I put myself in front of him. “Vinny, please, don’t,” I begged.",28,100
1pzbyjb,,"He shoved me aside. His eyes were focused on the porch, barely registering me. “You know I have to,” was all he said, continuing on his way.",27,101
1pzbyjb,,"It was nerve-wracking to watch him go, each step he got closer we grew more tense. Even Donny began to second guess himself.",23,102
1pzbyjb,,"“Hey, Vinny, let’s just get another thing to mark with, I think this might be a bad call…” he shouted, to no avail.",23,103
1pzbyjb,,"Vinny had let this thrill become an obsession, there was no stopping him. Finally, he was bending down to pick up the chip.",23,104
1pzbyjb,,"He held it high for us to see before he placed it on the top step, blue side up. We left after that, silently processing the last round.",28,105
1pzbyjb,,Vinny had purposefully called on himself to go up the steps.,11,106
1pzbyjb,,"It seemed he no longer had anything to prove to Donny or anybody else, he was caught up in the rush he got from it.",25,107
1pzbyjb,,"He came to me that night with an idea. “I’m going in next time,” he said. It didn’t surprise me, but I found tears running down my cheeks.",28,108
1pzbyjb,,I knew nothing I said would make a difference. I nodded my head.,13,109
1pzbyjb,,"“I’m going to tie a rope to my waist, if anything goes wrong you guys can just pull me back out,” he continued.",23,110
1pzbyjb,,"I fell asleep crying that night, not knowing how to stop what I feared would happen tomorrow.",17,111
1pzbyjb,,"Tim and Donny were waiting for us the next day, gravely silent, waiting for Vinny to address them.",18,112
1pzbyjb,,"He tied the rope and explained what he wanted them to do, asking me to be at the front of the line.",22,113
1pzbyjb,,"“Vinny… I love you,” I whispered, trying not to cry. To my surprise Donny and Tim were also misty-eyed, clapping Vinny on the back and wishing him good luck.",29,114
1pzbyjb,,"Vinny looked at us fondly, giving me a hug before turning away. I watched the rope uncoil by my feet until there was nearly nothing left.",26,115
1pzbyjb,,"Vinny was on the top step. He looked back at us, then reached for the door.",16,116
1pzbyjb,,"I wanted to scream at him to stop, to turn back and take me home, beg him to read me stories out of his favorite books, to ruffle my hair, to flash me his wicked smile.",36,117
1pzbyjb,,"But I couldn’t. Some part of me had to know, just like he did, what this house was.",18,118
1pzbyjb,,"I tightened my grip on the rope as he pushed the battered door open, revealing the dark entryway. He was there for a few seconds, then he disappeared from view.",30,119
1pzbyjb,,The rope nearly escaped from me. Something had yanked all three of us forward into the driveway.,17,120
1pzbyjb,,"I kept my feet dug into the dirt but it was no use, whatever had a hold of Vinny was taking us all with him.",25,121
1pzbyjb,,"My hands were being ripped apart, Tim and Donny were screaming behind me, all of us still keeping the rope in our grasp despite the agony.",26,122
1pzbyjb,,"I was wailing, barely able to breathe from the exertion and terror. We were heading at the front steps with alarming speed.",22,123
1pzbyjb,,"My heels left the ground and I tried bracing myself against the steps, pushing back with everything I had.",19,124
1pzbyjb,,"By then Tim had let go, screaming at Donny and I to do the same.",15,125
1pzbyjb,,"I flew upwards, smashing my knees and shins into the splintered wooden steps, being dragged to the doorway. I let out a cry of despair, fear, rage.",27,126
1pzbyjb,,"I let go just before I was pulled through the dark entryway, falling to the porch and rolling to my feet, desperate to catch a glimpse of what was happening inside.",31,127
1pzbyjb,,"I would never get one. The loop that had been tied around Vinny’s waist was tossed out at me, the door slamming shut immediately after.",25,128
1pzbyjb,,"In my shock, I laid down, unable to comprehend what had happened.",12,129
1pzbyjb,,"Donny ran up the steps and pulled me to my feet, taking me down the steps and away from whatever was in that house. The rest is a blur.",29,130
1pzbyjb,,"I made it home. Tim and Donny had to retell what had happened up there, I was too shocked to speak.",21,131
1pzbyjb,,"I moved into the old Danforth house when I got older. I didn’t buy it, it wasn’t for sale, but nobody was going to stop me from living there.",29,132
1pzbyjb,,"I spend my nights on the porch, looking into the upstairs window, my brother staring back, surrounded by darkness, not a day older than the last time I saw him.",30,133

The hum of the fluorescent lights behind me receded as Mara guided me through the twisted maze of cages.",37,0
1pz96ek,,"Each step hammered into me the brutal reminder of what would happen to me if I failed, and the weight of what I needed to do settled firmly across my shoulders.",31,1
1pz96ek,,"Passing them, the air changed, smelling of rot and despair, thick enough to taste. The women didn’t flinch.",18,2
1pz96ek,,"They were shadows of themselves, hollow shells whose eyes begged for help, but whose mouths could not.",17,3
1pz96ek,,"I felt rage coil inside me, tighter than the marks that still burned my wrists. It became fuel for me. I would not be them.",25,4
1pz96ek,,I would not let him name me. I would not end up in a cage.,15,5
1pz96ek,,"Mara led me toward a stairwell at the end of the corridor, past all of the cages. It was narrow and unstable, with peeling paint and wood warped by age.",30,6
1pz96ek,,"She stepped up on the first step, stopping for me to follow. Before I could climb up, she reached for my wrists, fumbling with something in her pockets.",28,7
1pz96ek,,"“Hold still.” She murmured, pulling the handcuff key out of her apron. She wrapped her fingers around my wrist and slipped the key into the hole.",26,8
1pz96ek,,"A click echoed faintly in the hallway as the burdensome metal restraints dropped away from my skin, leaving deep red impressions behind. I stared at her, stunned.",27,9
1pz96ek,,"I hadn’t expected mercy. I had given up on it. She met my eyes, her expression remaining blank.",18,10
1pz96ek,,"“You’ll need your hands free for this.”

I opened my mouth, unsure what to say, but she spoke again, her voice low and fierce. “Listen to me, Emily.",28,11
1pz96ek,,"Whatever he tells you or does to you… Whatever he makes you feel… it isn’t real unless you let it be, understand?",22,12
1pz96ek,,"He only wins if you break.”

She paused, searching my face. “Don’t break, Emily.”

She took a step back, tightening her jaw as the emotions welled up inside her.",29,13
1pz96ek,,"“This goes up,” she whispered, almost reverent. “He doesn’t expect anyone to reach it. The others never try.”

I hesitated. “Up there…” I swallowed hard.",25,14
1pz96ek,,"“You mean to him?”

Her gaze dropped, haunted and unreadable. “Yes.",11,15
1pz96ek,,"But don’t expect me to help you beyond this.” She hesitated, just long enough for me to see her stoic expression fracture. “I can’t. Not anymore.",26,16
1pz96ek,,"He has hollowed me out, carving pieces away until there was nothing left. I can walk this place freely, but I can’t change anything.",24,17
1pz96ek,,"I’m like a ghost, bound to this place. You’ll have to do this on your own.”

Her words sent a stinging chill up my spine.",25,18
1pz96ek,,I could feel her pain as if it were my own.,11,19
1pz96ek,,"I clenched my fists, tasting the metallic tang of fear on my tongue, coupled with fire, burning hot within me.",20,20
1pz96ek,,"I followed her up the stairs, the steps groaning under our weight. Each creak rang out loudly, exploding through the silence, but we remained undetected.",25,21
1pz96ek,,"When we reached the top of the stairs, Mara grabbed my shoulder and slid a finger over her lips. We had come too far to get caught now.",28,22
1pz96ek,,"We had to remain silent. The upper floor hallway was completely different from everything else. It was sterile and pristine, a new addition by the looks of it.",28,23
1pz96ek,,The air reeked with a sick cocktail of antiseptic and decay. Ahead of us sat a single door at the far end of the hall.,25,24
1pz96ek,,"As we approached it, I felt him. The weight of his dark, malicious presence.",14,25
1pz96ek,,"A cold, familiar certainty that had haunted me since the first time I heard him say my name. Mara stopped at the threshold.",23,26
1pz96ek,,"Her hand hovered over the handle as if touching it would burn her. “This is it,” she said softly. “Once you go in… there’s no turning back.”

I nodded.",29,27
1pz96ek,,"I didn’t need her permission. I’d waited too long and suffered too much. She stepped back, her face slipping back into neutrality.",22,28
1pz96ek,,"“Finish this, Emily.” She said, as she pulled the door shut, disappearing back into the hell that awaited her downstairs. I slipped further inside.",24,29
1pz96ek,,"The room was enormous, lit only by the faint glow of moonlight through a tall window. Shadows stretched across the wooden floor like long, crooked fingers.",26,30
1pz96ek,,"At first, everything was quiet. Almost too quiet. My own breathing sounded like a powered vacuum in my ears compared to the silence.",23,31
1pz96ek,,"My footsteps echoed in the giant room, even though I was stepping carefully, trying to remain quiet.",17,32
1pz96ek,,"I made my way across the room, turning a corner to reveal the entire upper level.",16,33
1pz96ek,,"Hallways and rooms stretched in each direction, some doors hanging crooked on their hinges, others closed tight as if hiding something behind them.",23,34
1pz96ek,,"Dust floated in the thin slivers of moonlight, twisting like tiny ghosts along the draft.",15,35
1pz96ek,,"The air was thick and stale, carrying the musty smell of sweat and decay through the halls. The place looked abandoned.",21,36
1pz96ek,,It was clear nothing here had been cleaned or touched by human hands in months or years.,17,37
1pz96ek,,"I continued to move cautiously, senses straining, every shadow appearing as a possible threat. I peeked into a room on the left. It was a bedroom, but just barely.",29,38
1pz96ek,,"The mattress lay directly on the floor, stained dark, sheets clinging to it like decaying skin that had begun sloughing away.",21,39
1pz96ek,,"Crumpled clothing and greasy remnants of takeout containers littered the corners, mold crawling over everything it could reach.",18,40
1pz96ek,,"There was a mirror opposite the bed smeared with fingerprints and small, frantic scratches as if someone had been clawing at it, desperately trying to escape their reflection.",28,41
1pz96ek,,"I stumbled back, bile bubbling up in my throat, but I forced myself to continue. Down the hall, I found what must have been his living space.",27,42
1pz96ek,,"A dilapidated couch sagged in the center of the room, stuffing spilling out like entrails. A flickering TV hummed in static, dragging back memories of my first days here.",29,43
1pz96ek,,"Tables were stacked with notebooks, pages scrawled in frantic handwriting, listing dozens of women’s names. My stomach churned at the sight, but I forced my legs forward.",27,44
1pz96ek,,"At the far end of the hall, a door stood slightly ajar, a faint light spilling from it. I paused, taking a deep, steady breath, and pushed it open.",29,45
1pz96ek,,"And there he was. He sat behind a desk, casual, almost paternal in his posture, as if the basement levels and the horrors they held never existed.",27,46
1pz96ek,,"His hair clung to his scalp in oily mats, his skin still ghostly white, glistening with sweat. His fingernails were cracked, coated in black grime.",25,47
1pz96ek,,Every crease of him seemed steeped in filth.,8,48
1pz96ek,,"His stench hit me, even from across the room, a nauseating mix of rot and something sour, nearly knocking me off my feet.",23,49
1pz96ek,,"My blood ran cold as he looked up from his notebook, a smile spreading across his face that promised pain without hesitation. “Emily,” he said softly, almost delighted.",28,50
1pz96ek,,"“I wondered how long it would take you.”

I felt Mara’s presence behind me, her shadow stretching along the wall.",20,51
1pz96ek,,"She didn’t move forward right away, remaining loyal in ways I still couldn’t understand. My hands trembled.",17,52
1pz96ek,,"Panic clawed at my mind, threatening to tear everything apart, but then I felt the floorboards creak beneath me.",19,53
1pz96ek,,"Mara had snuck up right behind me, using my silhouette in the doorway to hide her movement from his view.",20,54
1pz96ek,,"I felt her push something hard and cold onto my palm. An urgent whisper slid into my ear, cutting through the tension and snapping me back to reality.",28,55
1pz96ek,,"“Finish it.”

I looked down to see a jagged kitchen knife gleaming faintly in the moonlight. I swallowed hard, gripping it until my knuckles turned white.",26,56
1pz96ek,,"Fear still rattled in my chest, but my focus sharpened. I couldn’t back out now. I had prepared myself for this moment.",22,57
1pz96ek,,"He rose, gliding toward me with that same calm, unnatural grace. “You still think you’re someone, huh?” He asked, chuckling lightly.",21,58
1pz96ek,,"“I am,” I whispered, voice trembling but firm as I raised the knife.",13,59
1pz96ek,,"“And I am going to kill you.”

He laughed even louder, making the hair on my neck stand on end. “Bold. I like that. But you’re all alone.",28,60
1pz96ek,,"You can’t…”

I lunged without hesitation, cutting him off mid-sentence. The knife plunged into his side before he could react fully.",21,61
1pz96ek,,"His eyes widened, and for the first time, I saw shock and pain flicker through them. It made me almost dizzy with its unfamiliarity.",24,62
1pz96ek,,"He stumbled back, clutching the wound, deep red blood spreading across his filth-covered shirt, soaking into every inch.",18,63
1pz96ek,,"Rage twisted his features, warping him into something different now that he was stripped of his false civility. He lunged for me, unnaturally fast despite the wound.",27,64
1pz96ek,,"Adrenaline shot through me as the knife’s cold weight settled back into my hand. Mara’s words echoed in my ears, faint but clear.",23,65
1pz96ek,,"“Finish it.”

My grip tightened around the handle, the blood-slick steel grounding me. I drew a quick breath, letting the fear sharpen my senses, ready for whatever he brought next.",30,66
1pz96ek,,"He came across the table, swiping at me wildly and snarling in pain.",13,67
1pz96ek,,"His blood-soaked shirt dragged on the edge of the table, yanking him back, his fingers barely scraping past my arms as I sidestepped him.",24,68
1pz96ek,,"I lunged back at him, swinging blindly. The jagged blade tore into his side, sinking deep between his ribs.",19,69
1pz96ek,,"His voice exploded into a deep, guttural scream that ripped across the room. Blood poured from the wound, spraying across the table and my arms.",25,70
1pz96ek,,"I could feel the putrid, sticky substance clinging to my skin, a violent, wet reminder of how easy life can be taken.",22,71
1pz96ek,,"He pressed his hands to his wounds, blood seeping through his fingers as he steadied himself on his feet. His eyes locked on me, feral and full of hate.",29,72
1pz96ek,,"He screamed, then lunged at me again. I jerked aside, driving the knife into his shoulder as his momentum took him past me.",23,73
1pz96ek,,"Pain, shock, and disbelief flickered across his face, emotions I never thought I’d see in him.",16,74
1pz96ek,,"He stumbled, crashing into a wooden chair, sending notebooks and papers flying into the air, smeared in dark red.",19,75
1pz96ek,,"He rolled over amid the debris to face me, coughing as he tried to haul himself upright.",17,76
1pz96ek,,"“You think you can stop this?” he hissed, voice wet, choking down the blood in his throat. “You’ve done nothing.",20,77
1pz96ek,,"They’re already broken beyond repair.”

I stared at him, the fire in my chest coiling, sharp and merciless. Words were no longer necessary. I’d seen and heard enough.",28,78
1pz96ek,,"I wouldn’t let him steal another breath, another piece from me.",11,79
1pz96ek,,"I slashed again and again, each strike fueled by months of fear, by the hollowed eyes of the women in cages, by every tear Mara and Lilith shed on the cold floor.",32,80
1pz96ek,,"He collapsed to the floor, thrashing violently, gurgling curses that ended in wet, rattling gasps.",15,81
1pz96ek,,"His body rebelled against him, limbs jerking uselessly as each labored breath refused to come cleanly.",16,82
1pz96ek,,"The cold, untouchable certainty in his eyes cracked and crumbled away, revealing raw, unbridled fear in its place.",18,83
1pz96ek,,"He had become more animal than man, the source of fear and torment for so many, now a writhing, bloody mass on the wooden floor.",25,84
1pz96ek,,"Blood bubbled at the corner of his mouth as he tried to speak, barely dragging in air, yet no words came.",21,85
1pz96ek,,"Whatever he meant to say was never fully formed, wheezing and garbled words masking it. His fingers twitched weakly at my feet, as if I might save him.",28,86
1pz96ek,,"I stepped back. I didn’t want to hear any more. I heard Mara move behind me, almost undetectable, like a ghost.",21,87
1pz96ek,,"She paused, sweeping her eyes over him, taking in the carnage at her feet.",14,88
1pz96ek,,"The man who had tormented her body and mind for so many years lay there wheezing his final breaths. Her gaze lingered, unflinching.",23,89
1pz96ek,,"I could see the weight she carried in the set of her shoulders, the painful echo of years spent in chains and fear, forced to a life of twisted servitude.",30,90
1pz96ek,,"She didn’t speak immediately. When she did, her voice was rough and strained, as if she hadn’t spoken in months. “Years…” she murmured. “Years I’ve been here… too long.",29,91
1pz96ek,,"I’ve felt him in every breath, every second of every day. He changed me… hurt me. But… but I’m still here.”

Her eyes flicked up to me.",27,92
1pz96ek,,"“We’re still here.”

She moved toward the desk, cold determination filling every step.",13,93
1pz96ek,,"Her fingers shook as she grabbed the keyring off his desk, keys that had locked countless women away to be used and forgotten.",23,94
1pz96ek,,"She held them for a moment, almost reverently, then shoved them into my hand. “Go,” she said, sternly. “Free them.”

I didn’t hesitate.",23,95
1pz96ek,,"I tore through the corridors until the basement door was finally in sight. The stairwell yawned before me, the darkness below threatening.",22,96
1pz96ek,,"The screams flooded me the moment I turned the handle on the basement door, a tidal wave of sound, raw and overwhelming.",22,97
1pz96ek,,"Women stumbled forward, some frozen, some crawling, some screaming their names at me, as if saying them aloud could pull them back into their old life before the cages, before he got to them.",34,98
1pz96ek,,"The keys rattled in my trembling hands as I flew from cage to cage. The locks clattered on the concrete, some fused to flesh, some rusted and half-hanging on.",29,99
1pz96ek,,"Tears fell freely as chains fell from thin, bruised wrists and ankles. I ripped their restraints free, forcing their bodies upright.",21,100
1pz96ek,,"Some fell under their own weight, while others scratched and screamed for salvation.",13,101
1pz96ek,,"I gathered as many as I could, those who would let me help them, to guide them out of that horrid place.",22,102
1pz96ek,,"The basement itself seemed alive, shaking in anger at our defiance and lust for freedom. We moved slowly, each step a battle, each breath harder than the last.",28,103
1pz96ek,,"The passages and corridors seemed alien to some, but for others, it seemed as though they had mapped the entire place in their minds, almost leading ahead of me.",29,104
1pz96ek,,"Mara had descended the stairs back to the basement. She lingered at the back of the corridor, her pale, tear-streaked face framed by the shadows and flickering light.",28,105
1pz96ek,,"She watched us as we pushed our way out, silent, unmoving, her hands still trembling from the years of torment, but her eyes fixed on the freedom spilling through the halls.",31,106
1pz96ek,,"She didn’t follow. This place had taken too much from her to let her survive the light above. I gave her a last, desperate glance, pleading with her to follow.",30,107
1pz96ek,,"All she gave me was a smile. She didn’t owe me anything. She had handed me the keys, and that was enough. That was all that mattered now.",28,108
1pz96ek,,"I guided them upward, moving through the chaos of stumbling bodies, pulling and urging them to keep moving. I held hands, lifted bodies, cut through cords, whispered encouragement.",28,109
1pz96ek,,"The weight of years underground, of hunger, filth, and fear, fell away in bursts of pain and laughter as we finally reached the entrance door.",25,110
1pz96ek,,"With a few shoves, the latch came free, opening into the cold night, air sharp in our lungs, stars burning bright overhead.",22,111
1pz96ek,,"Some of them clung to me, sobbing and shaking. Others screamed in shock at the sensation of fresh air on their skin, light in their eyes.",26,112
1pz96ek,,"Several women screamed the moment they crossed the threshold, collapsing to the ground as if the air in their lungs was too much to handle.",25,113
1pz96ek,,"A few shielded their eyes, whimpering, as if the darkness above might cave in on them the way it always had before. Grass crunched beneath their bare feet.",28,114
1pz96ek,,"Some of them dropped to their knees, clawing at it with shaking hands, fingers digging into soil, making sure it was all real.",23,115
1pz96ek,,"One woman pressed her face into the ground and laughed hysterically, the sound breaking apart, quickly transforming into violent sobs. “I can feel it,” she whispered over and over.",29,116
1pz96ek,,"“I can feel the ground.”

None of us knew where we were. But we knew that we were no longer in cages. That’s what mattered.",25,117
1pz96ek,,"The house loomed behind us, its massive, dilapidated frame standing out against the night sky like a monument of rot and despair.",22,118
1pz96ek,,"The windows stared blankly into the dark, following us like cold, dead eyes as we fled.",16,119
1pz96ek,,"We ran across the yard, expecting lights… streetlamps, a road, anything, but there was nothing there. There were no neighboring houses, nor a road leading away. There were only trees.",30,120
1pz96ek,,"Endless trees swallowed the edges of the property, their twisted branches creaking softly in the night wind as they closed in around us.",23,121
1pz96ek,,"Even now, knowing that we were free, the feeling of pure isolation struck hard. Panic rippled through the group as the reality of it set in.",26,122
1pz96ek,,"“Where are we?” one woman cried. “Is this still part of it?” another whispered, terror seeping back into her voice.",20,123
1pz96ek,,"“I can’t go back,” one woman screamed suddenly, scrambling to her feet and spinning wildly in circles. “I won’t go back…I… I won’t.",23,124
1pz96ek,,"I won’t.”

“Hey,” I said sharply, grabbing her shoulders before she could run. She flinched violently at my touch, eyes wild, pupils blown wide.",24,125
1pz96ek,,"I loosened my grip immediately once I saw the pure terror sink back into her face. “Hey, listen to me. You’re outside. You’re free.",24,126
1pz96ek,,"He can’t hurt you anymore.”

She didn’t seem to hear me as she just stared at my mouth, watching the words come out as if she had lost all understanding of them.",32,127
1pz96ek,,That’s when I began to realize just how deep the damage truly went. Some of them no longer knew how to exist without commands or abuse.,26,128
1pz96ek,,"They had been told when to sleep, when to eat, and even when to suffer. Freedom wasn’t relief. It was confusion. It became the same terror, but without cage walls.",30,129
1pz96ek,,"“Stay together,” I said, louder now. “Please. Everyone, stay together.”

Keeping twenty-seven tortured women in one group together was much easier said than done.",24,130
1pz96ek,,One woman tried to run toward the trees before collapsing from exhaustion.,12,131
1pz96ek,,"Another had backtracked and curled herself into a ball near the porch steps, rocking back and forth, whispering a name I doubted anyone had heard in years.",27,132
1pz96ek,,"A few clung to each other desperately, arms locked so tightly their knuckles turned white.",15,133
1pz96ek,,"I knew I needed to do something soon, or this would have all been for nothing.",16,134
1pz96ek,,"We were out of our cages, now surrounded by nothing but dark, cold forest, which I knew could be just as cruel as the cages had been.",27,135

1pz96ek,,"We had no phone. No watch. No idea what time it was… or even what year, for that matter. We were free… but completely lost.",25,137
1pz96ek,,"The house stood on a massive stretch of land, deliberately isolated.",11,138
1pz96ek,,He had planned it this way… for all of our screams to go unheard and for no one to stumble across this place by accident.,25,139
1pz96ek,,"We could scream until our throats bled, and no one would come. Suddenly, through the trees, I saw movement. It was brief, but unmistakable. It was a pair of headlights.",30,140

“It’s not him,” I said quickly, though my heart pounded violently in my chest.",17,143
1pz96ek,,"“He can’t…he’s not.”

The headlights cut through the trees, blades of light slicing through the darkness.",16,144

1pz96ek,,"He froze. “Oh my god,” he breathed. I stumbled forward, hands raised instinctively, afraid sudden movement might send them running. “Please,” I pleaded, voice breaking. “We need help.",28,153

1pz96ek,,"For others, time had fractured, the harsh reality of years having passed them by, leaving an indelible mark on them. This new reality was fragile.",25,163

1pz96ek,,I focused my gaze on the pattern of the carpet and tried to steady my ragged breathing. I couldn’t afford to listen.,22,183
1pz96ek,,Allowing myself to hear his name felt like I’d be giving him an invitation into my mind once again.,19,184

1pz8m1x,I know there are seven other people out there who got the same package as me. Please come forward.,"From a Drinking Fellow (not many down; enough to forget the words in Webster's):

I don't know any other way to say what I have to say except to just say it: I know there are seven other people out there who got home late one day and found something crammed into their mailbox, right next to the evening newspaper and that month's batch of bills.",66,0
1pz8m1x,,"A bag, a brown paper bag, something one would use to pack up a lunch, that you found was wrapped over again numerous times in duct tape, found to be a paper bag only when you opened it, stared into its interior, and took in its inner walling and the thing sitting at the bottom of the bag.",58,1
1pz8m1x,,"If you were me, you did this and didn't even know there was a pigeon's head on the bottom of the bag, wrapped over in the duct tape, its outline clearly birdlike yet indistinguishable from that of any other fowl.",40,2
1pz8m1x,,"Did the package smell for anyone? Not for me, even though the thing inside was rotted and decomposed more than a month-old middle-of-the-median roadkill.",24,3
1pz8m1x,,The finger at the bottom of the bag didn't smell. It didn't reek.,13,4
1pz8m1x,,"It had no odor, except maybe for some nasal reminders of the odorless yet powerful aroma of saliva. It was like that, if the taste of saliva had a smell.",30,5
1pz8m1x,,"It goes well, I suppose, with the fact that the finger didn't have a fingernail: it had a tooth right where that's supposed to be.",25,6
1pz8m1x,,"Do you guys still think that's crazy? A fingernail that's a tooth? For me, the tooth looked like a human's.",20,7
1pz8m1x,,"It looked natural, though, natural in its placement, as if it was roused at the root and grew in. It looked natural that way, otherwise entirely unnatural. Irrational. I dunno.",30,8
1pz8m1x,,I can't think of many adjectives right now.,8,9
1pz8m1x,,"I suppose if I wasn't in the right mind at the moment I opened the package, I wouldn't have thought it was a finger.",24,10
1pz8m1x,,"I would have thought it was the world's most compact stick of dynamite, only if it were capped and not fused.",21,11
1pz8m1x,,"That doesn't exist, though, so I guess I'm spewing bullshit. I mean to say that the finger was gray, its texture rough.",22,12
1pz8m1x,,"This was the skin beneath the skin that had already aged off. I don't know what color the outer skin (the veneer?) was, or what it was.",27,13
1pz8m1x,,"Does skin blacken as it decomposes? If not, I guess the outer layer was African American.",16,14
1pz8m1x,,It went with the liquid stuff leaking from the flattened end where the finger was cleanly cut away from the knuckle. The color of that stuff was reddish.,28,15
1pz8m1x,,"Darkest maroon beneath the moon (dos that rhyme?)

I don't know about you seven, but I touched the finger immediately.",20,16
1pz8m1x,,"You may have thought it was a joint from your good Buddy Walt, if you shoot up often, but I thought it was what I said it looked like to me in the moment, a little stick of dynamite, and I wanted to get rid of it.",47,17
1pz8m1x,,"If it were dynamite, I guess the person who made it had the firmest press of his finger if he had printed on a full fingerprint.",26,18
1pz8m1x,,The fingerprint that was pressed into the second inner layer of skin.,12,19
1pz8m1x,,I saw the layers of shed black skin laying around the bottom of the bag when I shifted it around and adjusted into the light above my counter.,28,20
1pz8m1x,,"Some bits had their leftovers of a fingerprint, too.",9,21
1pz8m1x,,"Now, I admit it's possible I'm the only person who knows there are seven other people out there with the same package. Did you all get the letter, too?",29,22

1pz8m1x,,"I cut out the pigeon's head from the duct tape and saw: tightly rolled into a little hole in its face, where its beak should be, was a piece of paper.",31,24

""Tommy Tony has eight fingers, Tall Tony has eight fingers, Tommy Tony has eight toes, Tall Tony has eight toes, But they don't have feet, And they're like an ogre, And Daddy Randy gave the fingers, Like gold, to some to the needy.",61,26

Tell me if any of you got the note as well. Is it the same? Does it make more sense?",26,27
1pz8m1x,,And do any of you still have your finger? Mine is barely any longer. It's been peeling and peeling away like an orange.,23,28

1pz89su,I Think I Saw Someone Who Wasn’t Human on the Way to the Store,"It all started simply enough. I was walking to the corner store for small things maybe a soda or a tea, a bag of chips for a snack.",28,0
1pz89su,,"The kind of errand that exists purely to kill time. The day itself was entirely boring. Normal, offensively uneventful.",19,1
1pz89su,,"I had just looked up from my phone and back into the large, tireless crowd when I noticed it.",19,2
1pz89su,,"The man in front of me glanced back for all of a second, and his eyes did something weird. Something wrong.",21,3
1pz89su,,"His pupils shifted into a diamond shape, snapped back to round, then flooded completely black. I stopped walking. The man turned forward again and kept going like nothing had happened.",30,4
1pz89su,,Like his eyeballs hadn’t just violated several laws of biology and decency. People bumped into me from behind. A woman and her kid clipped my side.,26,5
1pz89su,,"My stomach dropped straight into my ass, and my throat suddenly felt like someone had shoved a rock down it and forgotten about it. I got shaky.",27,6
1pz89su,,"Sweat broke out down my back, the gross cold kind that clings to your shirt. I started walking backward, heart hammering, and turned around.",24,7
1pz89su,,I turned and began walking the opposite direction trying to get back to my apartment. Only to realize the same man had turned too. He was now walking beside me.,30,8
1pz89su,,"Great. I picked up my pace, deciding the store and its delicious little munchies could wait. They would still exist tomorrow. I hoped I would too.",26,9
1pz89su,,"My legs wobbled as I walked, like they were trying to decide if today was leg day or a medical emergency. There’s no way he noticed me. Right?",28,10
1pz89su,,"He didn’t know. Right? I couldn’t tell if I’d been found out, and my sweating, stomach flips, and general internal screaming were not helping.",24,11
1pz89su,,"I wanted to cry and run all the way home, but another thought slid in, cold and logical in the worst way possible. I didn’t want this man thing ...",30,12
1pz89su,,pretending to be a man to follow me to the one place I felt safe. I glanced sideways again. Yes. He was still there. Still keeping pace.,27,13
1pz89su,,"I started walking faster, bumping into people now, nearly breaking into what could generously be called a jog. Then the man did something horrible. He yelled, “Aye.”

I looked back.",30,14
1pz89su,,"Big mistake, huge, rookie horror-movie mistake. I don’t know why I did that. Reflex, I guess.",16,15
1pz89su,,Like when you hear your name yelled in public and your body betrays you before your brain can object. Acknowledging him made everything worse.,24,16
1pz89su,,The urge to ugly cry came back and my throat felt burdened. I wanted to teleport directly into my bed and pretend humans were still the apex species.,28,17
1pz89su,,"I looked around. I needed a crowd. A store. Somewhere public. I sped-walked into the nearest place available, which turned out to be a dumpling restaurant.",26,18
1pz89su,,"The smell of steamed dough, oil, and soy sauce hit me immediately warm, comforting, beautifully normal. I rushed to the front where a cashier was seating a family of four.",30,19
1pz89su,,I looked around. No man.,5,20
1pz89su,,"I finally let out a breath I didn’t realize I’d been holding and collapsed into a waiting chair, sweating and shaking like an erupting volcano with anxiety issues.",28,21
1pz89su,,"I jammed the heels of my palms into my eyes, wiping away panic tears before they could embarrass me in public.",21,22
1pz89su,,When I pulled my hands away and the blurry edges of my vision returned to normal. The man walked in through the front door. Cool. Fantastic. Love that for me.,30,23
1pz89su,,"I scrambled up and bolted through the closest door, hearing a woman behind me ask if I wanted a seat. No. I wanted to live.",25,24
1pz89su,,"I ran as fast as my Doc Martens would allow, rocks kicking up behind me.",15,25
1pz89su,,"I felt like a bulldozer with anxiety, mowing down a line of unsuspecting worker ants sorry, everyone, this is a supernatural emergency and death and life we're on the line.",30,26
1pz89su,,"There was no time to breathe. No time to cry. If I stopped for even one real breath, he’d be there. One second of oxygen wasn’t worth that.",28,27
1pz89su,,I ran like that dog named princess from my childhood who liked to bite all of the kids on the block.,21,28
1pz89su,,I ran like my uncle Fernando who got too excited when told that the booze was on the way.,19,29
1pz89su,,I ran as fast as I could still thinking of all of the weird little stories from my past that made me feel like I could keep going at this pace.,31,30
1pz89su,,Powered by memories that were deeply unhelpful but emotionally motivating. Though the stories weren't enough and neither were the memories.,20,31
1pz89su,,Uncle Fernandos drinking habit and princess the evil dog wasn't going to be enough to make me feel like my lungs weren't playing hop scotch with my blood vessels in hell.,31,32
1pz89su,,"Unfortunately, nostalgia is not a replacement for lungs. I had to stop, I had to or I would die on the spot.",22,33
1pz89su,,"Ahead of me loomed an abandoned building decrepit, half-collapsed, smelling faintly of rust and wet concrete. I couldn’t linger. I just needed inside. Then I could rest for a minute.",30,34
1pz89su,,"I flung myself toward the first window. Definitely abandoned. I ran to the door, grabbed the knob. Locked. Of course it was, what was I expecting.",26,35
1pz89su,,No way it would be that easy. I'd rate this day so far five stars on the crappy list of days I'd had recently.,24,36
1pz89su,,"I felt a sharp cramp stab into my side, because my body loves adding commentary, especially in the middle of panic.",21,37
1pz89su,,"I rounded the building and was immediately blessed by the universe for once. Right there might as well have lied an angel, or a horribly handsome man.",27,38
1pz89su,,In reality it was just A gap in a barbed-wire fence. My savior.,13,39
1pz89su,,"I skidded over and tried to gently pull myself through, the wire tugged at my hair and probably ripped out a few strands.",23,40
1pz89su,,"I Didn’t care, I didn't have time to.",8,41
1pz89su,,"Just then behind me, came heavy footsteps pounding on the ground in a run somewhere in the general direction I had came from.",23,42
1pz89su,,I ran further inwards and there was a small broken window leading into the basement of what I could only assume was a giant old factory probably for processed meats or something.,32,43
1pz89su,,"The air smelled moldy and damp, like regret. I hooked my hands on the frame and lowered myself in, dropping down with a thud. Pain shot through my ankles.",29,44
1pz89su,,"I let it sizzle for half a second, forcing my legs to absorb it. Outside, the fence rattled. Nope. Time to go.",22,45
1pz89su,,"I crept into the basement, scrambling over broken roofing and drywall. My legs screaming in protest they had never taken this much of a beating before.",26,46
1pz89su,,I stopped finally to catch my breath after I found a hidey-hole under the ground.,15,47
1pz89su,,"I slid a slab of roofing over the opening and dropped down, covering my mouth as I sat in total darkness. Everything hurt. Everything shook.",25,48
1pz89su,,Tears streamed down my face silently. I sat down and covered my mouth in the darkness.,16,49
1pz89su,,"Feeling all of the panic, fear, and tears that strained on my body I looked to the side feeling slightly dizzy all of a sudden. Then I heard him.",29,50
1pz89su,,"“You know you can’t hide, right, girl?”

His voice was calm, strong, wrong like two people speaking at once. “I will find you and end this. Don’t worry.",28,51
1pz89su,,I’ll only wipe your mind.,5,52
1pz89su,,"We don’t need humans telling stories about us.”

My adrenaline roared so loud I was convinced he could hear it, hell I'm convinced the world could hear it.",28,53
1pz89su,,"Though I'm pretty sure that was just me freaking out. I don’t know how long I stayed there. Hours, days.",20,54
1pz89su,,"Time stopped mattering I wasn’t panicked anymore just paranoid and mostly listening, waiting.",13,55
1pz89su,,I didn't hear a single sound since the talking which felt like it had happened so long ago now.,19,56
1pz89su,,The tears had kept coming but I wouldn't allow myself to make any noises I just sat there quietly crying.,20,57
1pz89su,,After I had woken up from what I could only assume was an anxiety induced passed out state. I finally gave myself the ok to start moving again.,28,58
1pz89su,,"Everything was incredibly quiet outside of the hidey hole. I moved slowly, stretching stiff muscles, pushing the roofing aside.",19,59
1pz89su,,I pushed it farther and peeked out seeing the floor and other dirty broken objects sitting around.,17,60
1pz89su,,"I had been so hyper focused I had barley noticed the smell of wet mold, rot, something sour. Honestly? Not ideal. Well.",22,61
1pz89su,,"Let’s hope I didn’t catch an undiscovered disease from being down there so long. I climbed out, inch by inch, with a struggle I got myself on the surface.",29,62
1pz89su,,Then I took the gentlest of steps each time heading towards where the window was I had came in through.,20,63
1pz89su,,Moving like I was in a SWAT raid with no weapon and zero training. each corner was looked over.,19,64
1pz89su,,"Too bad I didn't have a weapon to back it up, that would've helped my paranoia.",16,65
1pz89su,,My insides felt tight with worry as I brought myself closer and closer to what I perceived as freedom.,19,66
1pz89su,,I stopped at the room with the window entrance before going in looking around each other corner of the doors frame. Seeing nothing I crept in.,26,67
1pz89su,,And felt the biggest of reliefs there wasn't anyone in there. The window came into view. Relief flooded me so hard my knees almost gave out.,26,68
1pz89su,,I walked over to the window grabbed the frame and lifted myself up struggling again.,15,69
1pz89su,,I gripped the wall with my feet arched like I was walking down a steep mountain and pushed my weight at the top of my arms upwards wobbeling on my sweaty hands.,32,70
1pz89su,,I pushed my leg up and felt it push me upwards with that momentum I pushed my other leg up and suddenly I felt like a spider monkey.,28,71
1pz89su,,As I pushed my other leg out beside my wobbeling stressed out hands. Then came the easy part I pushed my last leg out.,24,72
1pz89su,,Then flatteneed against the ground for a second like a deflated balloon and brought my head up to look around.,20,73
1pz89su,,"I saw no one in sight, not morphing creatures or birds. I crawled all the way up into a sitting position.",21,74
1pz89su,,Then I dusted the dirt and rocks off of my palms and got up.,14,75
1pz89su,,I burst into a run heading towards the broken fence after that I ran to the nearest bus station.,19,76
1pz89su,,"I felt my mind drifting had any of that been real, just now? Maybe all of this was just a deluded scene conjured up by a very tired mind.",29,77
1pz89su,,Maybe my brain finally snapped. Writing it down would help. That’s what my therapist said.,15,78
1pz89su,,"I hadn't been sleeping well for a few days now, taking too many late nights at the antique store I worked at and feeding those puppies at the pound had made me a full time energy house.",37,79
1pz89su,,Maybe if I wrote this all down the crazy I was writing wouldn't make a lick of sense and that would help kickstart my tired mind into reality.,28,80
1pz89su,,I'd feel better and forget about the imagined creepy things I had seen.,13,81
1pz89su,,Maybe that man was coming after me because I dropped something and not because of some weird unsightly supernatural obstruction to reality.,22,82
1pz89su,,Though that wouldn't make up for the words he'd said to me in that abandoned building.,16,83
1pz89su,,"He said he'd wipe my mind, because ""we don't need humans telling stories about us.""

 I felt the visible confusion on my face and in my solar plexius.",28,84
1pz89su,,I looked up as a woman walked past bumping into me as the bus had in fact arrived and I was standing in the way of the door.,28,85
1pz89su,,Oops that's my bad really. I walked in slotting my debit card into the pay stand at the front and walked in after it spit out my day ticket.,29,86
1pz89su,,I showed the bus lady who nodded at me uncaringly. I walked further in and paused noticing something weird. Three peoples eyes weren't doing normal things.,26,87
1pz89su,,The woman that had knocked into me was staring up out the window as her eyes morphed into black pools of nothingness and then back into human shaped pupils.,29,88
1pz89su,,The panic returned instantly. The guy reading a coupon beside her out loud. Holding it up as if checking if it were real cash his eyes had morphed too.,29,89
1pz89su,,I stared in shock if my mouth weren't on the floor I don't know where it was. Maybe I had lost it.,22,90
1pz89su,,"The kid beside the man was drinking the sippy cup and looking around at everyone but his eyes too, morphed into black inky voids.",24,91
1pz89su,,I felt that ass dropping panic again and I swooshed to the side almost falling face first into a holding pole besides me when the bus had started moving.,29,92
1pz89su,,Luckily instead of eating pole my neck hugged it and the rest of me followed holding the pole around me like a sloth.,23,93
1pz89su,,I didn't care how stupid or weird I probably looked not right now because there were three of those things in the bus with me.,25,94
1pz89su,,I heard the man reading out loud laugh but there was something wrong with his voice for a split second. It sounded like he had two voices.,27,95
1pz89su,,I looked over at him and he peered up at me after a bit. I looked away instantly and waited for my stop.,23,96
1pz89su,,I pulled the call button for requested stops at the top of the bus and waited.,16,97
1pz89su,,I got off in front of my apartment and felt the mans eyes on the back of my skull as I walked out.,23,98
1pz89su,,"I ran into my apartment heading into the comfort of my room where I promptly fell apart. Crying, screaming, thrashing and throwing things.",23,99
1pz89su,,I wasn't sure why but a part of my life for the last few hours had felt out of my control.,21,100
1pz89su,,And that pissed me off but it also terrified me. I'm going crazy. My therapist said that writing down information always helps. So that's exactly what this is.,28,101
1pz89su,,I'm not sure if it worked. Let's hope I don't see any more of whatever those things are pretending to be human.,22,102

1pz7cqt,,It’s a good and effective salve for heartbreak. The first couple weeks were great.,14,1
1pz7cqt,,I saw different muscle striations and all that pop up in my mirror and was quite pleased with myself.,19,2

1pz7cqt,,"I’d watched every workout regimen on YouTube, followed every content creator, subscribed to a monthly protein powder delivery service but the results were frustratingly, incrementally tiny.",26,6
1pz7cqt,,"It was to the point that all this work felt pointless, and the weights simply refused to go up even a few digits.",23,7
1pz7cqt,,"Eventually, out of frustration, I gave up for a few weeks as I felt like I was simply destined to be a non-responder to any kind of progressive overload.",29,8
1pz7cqt,,What changed my mind and forced me to back into that room full of soulless motivation was scrolling through Instagram and finding my crush fawning over this musclebound dude at some party.,32,9

1pz7cqt,,He could make it happen in less than 2 months! I saw him near the squat racks where he usually resided grunting in ways that would make anyone around blush.,30,15
1pz7cqt,,"Ignoring the obnoxious display of strength, I walked up to him and waited for him to finish his set.",19,16
1pz7cqt,,I told him I was ready for the supposed back-alley super soldier serum he had mentioned a year into him watching me frequent the gym.,25,17

1pz7cqt,,"I’d have to accept all aspects of it wholeheartedly, side-effects and everything.",12,19
1pz7cqt,,"At that point, I had researched this field enough that I felt like I knew everything I needed to know about PEDs.",22,20
1pz7cqt,,"I was willing to accept the risks and a blood pressure, the magnitude of a firehose. Est quod id est and I told him to bring it on.",28,21

1pz7cqt,,Come 11 p.m. Thursday and I was at this address he had given me. I rang the doorbell and Muscle Dude’s friend showed up to usher me in.,28,23
1pz7cqt,,"He once again asked me if I was sure about this, as the side effects that he refused to elaborate on, to protect the experimental nature of their operation, could get quite demanding of my body.",36,24
1pz7cqt,,"I had already made up my mind at that point and agreed to their terms and conditions, verbally of course.",20,25
1pz7cqt,,They also asked me about my sexual exploits which I thought was odd but I wasn’t going to make it seem like I was a loser who didn’t get none.,30,26
1pz7cqt,,"The dose was a one-time thing which struck me as odd, but like you can probably already tell at this point, I’m as water headed as the stereotypes about bodybuilders might suggest.",32,27
1pz7cqt,,They stuck me with the needle and sent me home. Their only instructions were to take it easy and do what I had been doing up to that point.,29,28

1pz7cqt,,My hamster LeBron James had escaped his cage but that was nothing out of the ordinary. I’d find him eventually under the couch munching on a seed. Probably.,28,31
1pz7cqt,,I assigned my strange experience to the drug and went on with my day. After work I drove to the gym to find my buddy wasn’t anywhere to be seen.,30,32

1pz7cqt,,"My tris and pecs also seemed to be leaps and bounds bigger than they usually are, and I was glad to see that the drug was working.",27,34
1pz7cqt,,I went out to a nightclub later that week with a few of my friends and found that I actually had women eyeing me.,24,35
1pz7cqt,,That had never happened before and I wasn’t complaining!,9,36
1pz7cqt,,My new-found confidence had me chatting up a few women and before long I had found someone who wanted to do the horizontal tango with me. Pardon my phrasing.,29,37

1pz7cqt,,"My new friend was sympathetic and after doing the deed, partially, we promptly fell asleep.",15,39
1pz7cqt,,I woke up to the other half of the bed being empty and the same breathlessness I had experienced the other day.,22,40

1pz7cqt,,"Ignoring the obvious red flags that this drug and my buddy had presented, I went about my week, till eventually I found myself at the same nightclub picking up another girl.",31,43
1pz7cqt,,The same thing happened again. Whatever. I still couldn't find LeBron and I was starting to worry I had a tiny little casket I needed to buy.,27,44
1pz7cqt,,I shoved the thoughts out of my head as I got up to admire myself in the mirror and how sculpted I was starting to look.,26,45
1pz7cqt,,"Just 45 minutes today though. Have a tight schedule to stick to, you know.",14,46
1pz7cqt,,I installed a camera that gave me a good view of my studio in case LeBron decided to show up.,20,47
1pz7cqt,,Fast-forward a week and I was bringing home a girl for the third week in a row. This was unprecedented but I wasn’t about to question my luck.,28,48
1pz7cqt,,"Guess all it really did take was a sculpted body. I thought to myself, “Tonight’s the night.",17,49
1pz7cqt,,"It’s going to happen again.” Seems like I self-actualized into an ED patient, but I had a pill that was going to help with that.",25,50
1pz7cqt,,"Finally, having the done the deed in full, we promptly fell asleep. I woke up next to the no one. The breathlessness now ever-present.",24,51
1pz7cqt,,This was starting to take a toll on my mental health and I started to ponder whether drunken hookups were really my thing.,23,52
1pz7cqt,,I was curious how I did not notice her leaving and how my door was locked from the inside.,19,53
1pz7cqt,,Couldn’t picture her jumping out the window unless she could fit a parachute in the handbag she had.,18,54
1pz7cqt,,My mental acumen decided to surprise me and reminded me that I had a camera that overlooked my small studio and that it wasn’t pervy to have footage of a dalliance with a stranger if I wasn’t going to upload it for a quick buck.,45,55
1pz7cqt,,"Anyway, I played the footage from last night and what I saw was hard to describe. Around 3 a.m. I turned into an amorphous blob.",25,56
1pz7cqt,,My bones reached the consistency of jelly.,7,57
1pz7cqt,,"My facial features stretched across a now featureless face and I spread over this woman whose name I did not remember and with a sickening crunch of what I can only assume was her bones, started to engulf and consume her.",41,58
1pz7cqt,,"I could see the outline of her face pushing against my skin, trying to escape.",15,59
1pz7cqt,,All of this was horrifying to watch but I put myself though it with a macabre sense of curiosity.,19,60
1pz7cqt,,"If this was what it took to become just another generic Instagram model, then this was not what I signed up for.",22,61
1pz7cqt,,"Regardless of what you say happened earlier in this story. Now guilty of manslaughter, I drove to the address Mr.",20,62
1pz7cqt,,"Clean had given me, and I found that no one came to the door. Day after day, week after week, I found that no one occupied the property.",28,63
1pz7cqt,,"I did not know what to do and in a bid to vindicate myself, decided to scrape it under the rug and forget it ever happened.",26,64
1pz7cqt,,That was it for my sex-life I suppose. No more organic matter in my bedroom was my solution for a while.,21,65
1pz7cqt,,I guess I could just wait for the drug to wear off. I swear I’m not a psychopath. I just feel very little in terms of emotion and guilt.,29,66
1pz7cqt,,"As the weeks went by, my face started to look gaunter and hollower.",13,67
1pz7cqt,,People brought up my appearance and recommended I rest up as I looked like a live action Cruella. I took their advice and started to rest a lot more.,29,68
1pz7cqt,,The gym which started all of this was now the least of my concerns.,14,69
1pz7cqt,,"I was worried I’d be a part of someone’s investigations but fortunately, I did not seem to have to answer for my crimes. Not that I intended to anyway.",29,70
1pz7cqt,,"Id erased the footage of my midnight snacking, so I doubt I had anything to worry about.",17,71
1pz7cqt,,"A few weeks of taking time off from work and bed-rotting, I saw that I had started to lose the shape I had worked my ass off for.",28,72
1pz7cqt,,"Thinking to myself, I decided I was ready to pay the price of what it took to maintain this figure.",20,73
1pz7cqt,,"My apartment did not allow pets so I couldn’t exactly buy up the hamster section of a PetSmart to do this, so it would have to be another woman.",29,74
1pz7cqt,,"Eh, I’d sleep on it and think about going at it tomorrow. The Sun rose, and I tried to get out of bed.",23,75
1pz7cqt,,I say try because I couldn’t sit up. I had no bones. I was a shapeless blob draped over my bed like a bedsheet.,24,76
1pz7cqt,,I smelled putrid and had ooze oozing out of me. Was this going to be my fate now?,18,77
1pz7cqt,,"Voice to text on my phone has helped me tell you about what has happened but as I type this, I hear clicking noises coming from my lock.",28,78
1pz7cqt,,"My door's cracked open and I see my guy poke his hulking head through the door. . . . Heyy buddy, anyone coming around to look for you?",28,79
1pz7cqt,,Thought you said you’d have someone in that bed like every week. Did you work out what was happening?,19,80
1pz7cqt,,"Ah well, if noones going to miss you, I sure hope you don’t mind if I take a quick nap on you, do you?",24,81
1pz73d9,I installed the wrong language learning app,"Like most people, I was unsatisfied with how few languages I knew.",12,0
1pz73d9,,"Actually, the plural in “languages” there was just for show, I’d only known one language my entire life and that was English.",22,1
1pz73d9,,"I wasn’t even particularly good at English, just passable.",9,2
1pz73d9,,"But things changed when my group of friends decided that we should each encourage each other to do something new and exciting, so I chose to learn a new language – German.",32,3
1pz73d9,,"I had picked out a couple apps and tried. There was Deutschwelle, Babel and of course, Duolingo.",17,4
1pz73d9,,"Each had their pros and cons, but none grew on me and so I gave up on all of them.",20,5
1pz73d9,,"The furthest I went was a one-month streak with Duolingo, and that was with using some streak-keeping functions on the app.",21,6
1pz73d9,,I aired my grievance to my group of friends one Friday evening.,12,7
1pz73d9,,Josh thought it was because I wasn’t dedicated enough and needed a system of informing my friends about my progress.,20,8
1pz73d9,,"Nathan, on the other hand, thought that maybe I tried too many things too quickly and just lost steam. Nguyen was the one who recommended a better learning app.",29,9
1pz73d9,,"Deutschdevil looked just like any other language app, save for the fact that the mascot and also the icon for the app was the face of a demon – two red horns, long tongue and red eyes with white irises.",40,10
1pz73d9,,It had the initials D E on his forehead. I didn’t even remember how I installed it.,17,11
1pz73d9,,I remembered having to run through hoops and Nguyen having to sit with me for nearly the rest of that evening.,21,12
1pz73d9,,"“Man, this is really a hassle,” I told him when I had to visit a weird website to install the app. “I know, but it was really effective for me.",30,13
1pz73d9,,It even threatens you when you break your streak. So German. Try it.,13,14
1pz73d9,,"I guarantee you’ll love it.”

I let out a sigh and finished jumping through all the necessary steps. On the registration screen, the app didn’t even ask for my name.",30,15
1pz73d9,,It just gave me one of the terms and condition screen. I scrolled past it as usual and it prompted me to re-read.,23,16
1pz73d9,,“You can’t terminate this contract once it’s signed. Read carefully” the screen said. I scrolled past it again. It was the fourth app I installed. I knew the drill.,29,17
1pz73d9,,"As soon as I hit accept, pain instantly shot up my index finger and I dropped my phone.",18,18
1pz73d9,,"I looked at my finger and there was a drop of blood on it. “What the..”

“It did that to me too. Exciting huh?” Nguyen said.",26,19
1pz73d9,,"“Uh, apps can’t prick your finger, dude. It’s a coincidence that it happened to you too,” I told him. He gave me this self-assured just-believe-me-dude look.",26,20
1pz73d9,,"I picked up my phone and put it in my pocket, planning to start my lesson that evening.",18,21
1pz73d9,,"When I got home, I fed my dog Red, showered, and then took out my phone.",16,22
1pz73d9,,"Deutschdevil showed a notification, asking me to select how many minutes I would spend learning in a day. There were two options. 666 and 13.",25,23
1pz73d9,,"I thought that was very thematic. I preferred even numbers, so I picked 666 and it led me to a screen that explained the rules.",25,24
1pz73d9,,"I would need to learn 6 new words every day, 6 days a week for 6 months. I thought that was simple enough.",23,25
1pz73d9,,The app asked me if I was sure. I agreed and it took me to the first lesson.,18,26
1pz73d9,,The layout was very similar to Duolingo and I immediately got to learning. I made very quick progress. My previous grammar knowledge from other apps helped.,26,27
1pz73d9,,"After 30 minutes of German, I got tired and just turned off my phone and slept. That Saturday I had a blind date.",23,28
1pz73d9,,"I spent practically the entire day preparing for the date, working out, picking the right outfit and watching my favorite influencers talking about how to score on a date.",29,29
1pz73d9,,"I forgot about Deutschdevil. That evening, I was having a lot of fun with my date Samantha. She was sweet, funny and gorgeous and seemed really into me.",28,30
1pz73d9,,"I thought to myself there was no way I would fumble this. In the middle of our conversation, my phone dinged and showed a notification.",25,31
1pz73d9,,"It was Deutschdevil, reminding me that I needed to complete my streak. I ignored the app and continued with my evening. The evening grew steamy.",25,32
1pz73d9,,"Samantha was in the bathroom freshening up and I was sitting on the bed. My phone rang again, Deutschdevil sent out another warning about keeping my streak.",27,33
1pz73d9,,I ignored it once again. I was about to finally get laid after months and I wasn’t about to learn German before it.,23,34
1pz73d9,,We did what couples did when they are naked together and we fell asleep soon after. My phone sent out another notification.,22,35
1pz73d9,,"This time though, the background of my phone turned red. Thinking it was some sort of error, I sat up and looked at it.",24,36
1pz73d9,,"The background wasn’t just red, it showed arms jutting out from the earth with rend flesh and exposed, bloody bones.",20,37
1pz73d9,,I clicked on the notification and it took me to the Deutschdevil app.,13,38
1pz73d9,,"Before I could do anything, a text in black background and crimson letters told me that I broke my streak and the punishment would be one cut on my hand.",30,39
1pz73d9,,"It also warned me that the next time I broke my streak, one of my bones would break. I had to admit, reading that really made my heart jump.",29,40
1pz73d9,,"But I didn’t think much of it, it was probably just a psychological trick made by the developers to make sure that I stayed on the app and learned.",29,41
1pz73d9,,"I scoffed, put down the phone and went back to bed. Mere seconds later, I felt a sharp pain on my right hand.",23,42
1pz73d9,,"I looked at it, there was a deep cut, as if a knife had sliced my hand. Blood poured out and Samantha had to bandage me.",26,43
1pz73d9,,I thought that I must have hit my hand on something and soon fell asleep. The following days passed by in a blur.,23,44
1pz73d9,,"I would get up, go to work, go home, learn some German on Deutschdevil and fall asleep. It was business as usual until Friday.",24,45
1pz73d9,,On that day I went to a party with my group of friends.,13,46
1pz73d9,,"Josh was learning to be a mixologist, so naturally I tried out many of his drinks and got so drunk I couldn’t feel my hand.",25,47
1pz73d9,,"I only remembered drinking way too much before passing out on the couch. I woke in the middle of the night from a dull, throbbing pain.",26,48
1pz73d9,,"I took my right hand to wipe my eyes and the moment I tried to move my left arm, pain shot up like thousands of needles poking me in the arm.",31,49
1pz73d9,,I looked at my left arm and it was bent at a weird angle. I immediately groaned and woke up my friends. Josh woke up first.,26,50
1pz73d9,,He mixed the drinks and so didn’t drink much. He saw my arms and immediately rushed to find a splint. We settled on a piece of cut out cardboard.,29,51
1pz73d9,,Nathan drove me to the hospital and Josh got in the car as well. “What the hell did you do?,20,52
1pz73d9,,How did you even break your arm like that?” Josh asked. “I don’t know man.,15,53
1pz73d9,,"Last thing I remembered was having a White Russian that you made and passing out on the couch,”

“Maybe someone laid or stepped on it while you were asleep.",29,54
1pz73d9,,"People get drunk at a party and often bump into stuff” Nathan added. “Yeah, but so hard it breaks his bone? Just doesn’t make sense man.” Josh said.",28,55
1pz73d9,,The hospital visit was uneventful. The doctor smelled alcohol on my breath and assumed I had a fight with someone and was too embarrassed to tell him why.,28,56
1pz73d9,,"We did an X-ray scan and then he cleaned my arms before putting it in a cast. By the time I got home again, it was afternoon.",27,57
1pz73d9,,I took out my phone and once again saw the red background with arms jutting out. It was Deutschdevil. Suddenly something inside me clicked and I recalled the app’s warning.,30,58
1pz73d9,,I clicked on the notification and it took me to Deutschdevil’s screen.,12,59
1pz73d9,,"It told me that I broke my streak and the punishment was one broken bone and warned me that the next time, the one whom I held close would die.",30,60
1pz73d9,,I was freaked out at reading this. A cut on the hand was one thing but a broken bone? Something was definitely up with this app.,26,61
1pz73d9,,I tried to delete it but the delete button didn’t show up. The only options were to select either 666 or 13.,22,62
1pz73d9,,"Alarmed, I texted Nguyen to ask him about this app. He didn’t reply. I called him and still no answer. Defeated, I opened Deutschdevil and learned German.",27,63
1pz73d9,,I asked my boss to take the next week off due to health issues and he agreed. You could make plenty of excuses with a broken arm.,27,64
1pz73d9,,"Samantha came by and took care of me in the evening. Alone at home, I caught up with learning German using Deutschdevil. I was getting better, or so I thought.",30,65
1pz73d9,,"When Samantha told me she spent 6 months in Germany, I was surprised.",13,66
1pz73d9,,"We tried having a conversation in German and my “die”, “der” and “das” articles were all over the place. I gave up after 5 minutes.",25,67
1pz73d9,,"Obviously, she was much better than I was. I started regretting even installing Deutschdevil. The week went by quickly and soon Friday evening came again.",25,68
1pz73d9,,I was watching a movie with Samantha when I received a call from Josh.,14,69
1pz73d9,,"“Nguyen is dead”

“What?” I asked him before realizing that I completely forgot about the text message I sent to Nguyen. “He just died this evening.",26,70
1pz73d9,,"They guessed that it was a brain aneurysm. He just dropped dead. The funeral’s on Sunday”

The news hit me like a truck.",23,71
1pz73d9,,"Nguyen was one of the healthiest among my friend group. He ate vegan, attended frequent marathons and was fit and strong.",21,72
1pz73d9,,His passing was so sudden I was shocked more than sad. It was a rainy Sunday during Nguyen’s funeral.,19,73
1pz73d9,,His mom bawled her eyes out when his coffin was lowered into the ground.,14,74
1pz73d9,,"When she saw me, she muttered something under her breath but I couldn’t hear it before she cried again.",19,75
1pz73d9,,"The wind and rain sheets only accentuated the drab grey of the cemetery. After the funeral was over, Nguyen’s mom walked over to where we were standing.",27,76
1pz73d9,,I was chatting with Nathan and Josh about how Nguyen’s death didn’t make sense. It was our own way of making sense of what happened and process grief.,28,77
1pz73d9,,"“Thank you for coming to his funeral. He would have wanted you all to be here.”

“It’s no problem, ma’am. We want to be here, for him,” I told her.",30,78
1pz73d9,,"“I know it’s not right to ask, but did you notice anything strange before his passing?” Josh asked. “Don’t ask that question. She’s still grieving.",25,79
1pz73d9,,Brain aneurysm is always unpredictable” Nathan said. “I just… it just didn’t make sense to me” Josh said. “It’s okay.,20,80
1pz73d9,,"There wasn’t anything strange with Nguyen up until the very end. After his phone broke, he just kept muttering something about keeping the streak or something. He would get obsessed.",30,81

1pz73d9,,How many days ago was that?” I asked her. “I couldn’t remember clearly. Maybe 3 or 4 days.,18,83
1pz73d9,,"I wanted to ask you something, did he talk to you about his symptoms or something? Why did he mention you?",21,84
1pz73d9,,"Do you two have the same condition?” Nguyen’s mom asked me. Deutschdevil immediately came to my mind, but I couldn’t tell her that an app probably killed her son.",29,85
1pz73d9,,I ended up just telling her that I didn’t know either and he was probably just hallucinating.,17,86
1pz73d9,,She looked like she didn’t believe me for a second but went away eventually. I went home and Red greeted me at the door.,24,87
1pz73d9,,I petted him on the head and felt somewhat lighter. I sat down immediately tried to find ways to delete the app.,22,88
1pz73d9,,Once again there was no delete button when I held on it. So I tried to factory reset my phone. The screen went black and a progress bar showed up.,30,89
1pz73d9,,"When it was done restarting, I looked around and to my horror, Deutschdevil was the only non-essential app on my phone.",21,90
1pz73d9,,"The devilish face was still there, as if mocking me. I clicked on the app and searched around for the developer’s information but there wasn’t any.",26,91
1pz73d9,,"I plugged my phone to my laptop and did some digging for meta information on the app. There was no developer, no publisher, no official website, nothing.",27,92
1pz73d9,,I retraced the websites that Nguyen sent me and found an unofficial forum for past users of the app.,19,93
1pz73d9,,It took me to a website with the same demon theme with a dark background and crimson letters. I scrolled through and read a few threads.,26,94
1pz73d9,,There were only a handful of users. The top post was about someone completing 6 months of Deutschdevil. He said he “survived the gauntlet”.,24,95
1pz73d9,,The comments were people cheering him up. The next post was about someone looking for the information of the developer.,20,96
1pz73d9,,"One of the users left a cryptid comment: “The dev is the beloved fallen son, you need look no further.”

I closed the laptop and rubbed my eyes.",28,97
1pz73d9,,I was in way over my head with this app. But I guessed that I could manage 6 new words a day for 6 months.,25,98
1pz73d9,,The following week passed by quickly. I made learning German one of the first thing to do after I got out of bed so that I wouldn’t forget it.,29,99
1pz73d9,,"I was getting slightly better at German day after day, but still couldn’t hold a full conversation in German with my girlfriend.",22,100
1pz73d9,,"Friday came and Samantha dropped by my house again. We talked, watched a movie, ate dinner and slept together.",19,101
1pz73d9,,"She was having an episode of insomnia and wanted to talk through the night. I was dead tired and so fell asleep. “Hey, my phone’s battery is dead.",28,102
1pz73d9,,"Can I use yours?” she asked before I closed my eyes. “Sure, go ahead,” I answered before falling asleep.",19,103
1pz73d9,,"That morning, I woke up and learned 6 new words like always. Samantha made me breakfast before leaving for her own home.",22,104
1pz73d9,,I spent the entire day watching movies and took Red out for a jog in the afternoon. The cold air jolted my lungs awake.,24,105
1pz73d9,,Samantha told me that she would be back that evening to make dinner together. Me and Samantha watched a Thai horror movie while finishing our dinner.,26,106
1pz73d9,,Red whimpered at the scene which revealed that the ghost was sitting on top of the main character the whole time.,21,107
1pz73d9,,"After cleaning up, we got to bed and fell asleep. I woke up that night to ringing. I opened my eyes and looked at my watch. It was 3 A.M.",30,108
1pz73d9,,"I looked at my phone. Once again, the familiar crimson background with decaying arms was there. “No no no” I screamed and woke up Samantha. “What’s going on?",28,109
1pz73d9,,"Why aren’t you in bed?” she asked. “My phone…I lost my streak again. That’s impossible!”

“What? You’re not making a lot of sense.",23,110
1pz73d9,,"What are you talking about?”

“The German learning app. I broke my streak” I told her, my voice shaking and cracking up. “Oh that? Sorry.",25,111
1pz73d9,,Yesterday I looked around your phone and saw only that app so I played around with it.,17,112
1pz73d9,,"Pretty cool language app, a little bloody and demon-themed for me.”

“Yes, but that wasn’t supposed to happen. I already learned 6 words this morning.”

“Oh that?",27,113
1pz73d9,,"I played around with it yesterday and found a setting which said 13 so I clicked on it.”

“You did what?” I couldn’t believe in my ears.",27,114
1pz73d9,,"“Yeah, I thought since you wanted to improve your German so bad, 13 words a day will do you good. It’s not that hard”

She didn’t understand the consequences.",29,115
1pz73d9,,I immediately clicked on the phone and it took me to a warning screen.,14,116
1pz73d9,,It told me that I broke my streak and the one I held dear would be dead. It also warned me about the next time I break my streak.,29,117
1pz73d9,,It then showed a countdown to 10. I looked at Samantha and hugged her tightly. “I’m sorry. I’m so fucking sorry Samantha.,22,118
1pz73d9,,"I love you a lot and it’s killing you”

“You’re scaring me,” she told me with a shaky voice. I didn’t say anything.",23,119
1pz73d9,,"I hugged her and looked at my phone. The countdown slowly reached zero. When it did, I felt Samantha’s body went limp. “I’m sorry Samantha.",25,120
1pz73d9,,"I love you” I told her. “Yes, I love you too, but..” she answered. My head felt like it was torn open and light was streaming in.",27,121
1pz73d9,,She was still alive. I nearly cried from being so happy. “I think something’s wrong with your dog” she told me.,21,122
1pz73d9,,I looked behind me and my dog Red was taking staggered steps. He walked around for a while before collapsing on the floor. I rushed towards him.,27,123
1pz73d9,,"He was looking at me with those beady eyes and moments later, his chest stopped heaving and he was gone.",20,124
1pz73d9,,"That was when I realized how much I loved my dog. He was with me through thick and thin, always cheering me on.",23,125
1pz73d9,,"Every time I got home, he would be there, wagging his tails and licking my arms.",16,126
1pz73d9,,The memories with him came flooding back and I realized that I was never going to feel that again. Tears streamed from my eyes and I couldn’t control them.,29,127
1pz73d9,,"Samantha sat next to me and she put a hand on my shoulder, but the pain only magnified. I held a small funeral for my dog.",26,128
1pz73d9,,I took his remains to be cremated and scattered his ashes on a hill nearby. Samantha couldn’t understand why I did what I did.,24,129
1pz73d9,,"She told me that I should delete the scary app. On the way home, I bumped into a homeless guy. In my anger I scolded the man harshly.",28,130
1pz73d9,,"He gave me a weird stare before rushing away. When I got back home, I reached inside my pocket. Only, my phone wasn’t there.",24,131
1pz73d9,,"I felt my face hot and blood drained from my arms. I searched around like a mad man, asked Samantha to call my phone number but couldn’t find it anywhere.",30,132
1pz73d9,,"Then I remembered the homeless man. So I’m writing this to tell you what happened to me. If you are that homeless guy, please return my phone.",27,133

1pz4c3v,,"“I’m here,” I said, grabbing the receiver. “What’s wrong, Logan?”

“Oliver’s not responding…” Logan muttered. “Can you check on him? You’re the closest.”

I didn’t want to answer.",28,8
1pz4c3v,,"I had finally settled into my little hideout for the night, and Oliver… Well, Oliver wasn’t exactly great company anymore.",20,9
1pz4c3v,,"Something broke inside him years ago, down here in the dark.",11,10
1pz4c3v,,"He was stationed at the front gate, the place where the creatures would come through if they ever broke in.",20,11
1pz4c3v,,My dad always said there was no coming back from that post.,12,12
1pz4c3v,,"I’ve lived in these tunnels for twenty years, and I’ll admit it: I’ve never seen any of the “horrors” myself.",20,13
1pz4c3v,,"But my father was convinced, knew it in his bones, that if we didn’t keep the system under control… hell itself would break through. “Chuck?",25,14
1pz4c3v,,"You checking on Oliver or what?” Logan snapped. “Stop drifting off!”

“Yeah… yeah. I’m going.” I fumbled with the radio. “I’ll go take a look.”

“Copy that.",27,15
1pz4c3v,,"And Chuck… stay sharp. Don’t zone out.”

“Got it, Logan.” I rolled my eyes, even though he couldn’t see it. “Copy. Over and out.”

The radio went quiet again.",29,16
1pz4c3v,,"I let out a long breath. Oliver was at least a two-hour walk from here. And today? I really, really didn’t feel like going anywhere near him.",27,17
1pz4c3v,,My father trained me well for this sewer life. I knew exactly how to get to Oliver without wading through waist-deep filth.,22,18
1pz4c3v,,And there was one rule he drilled into me more than anything else: never go anywhere unarmed. He had this old shotgun he carried everywhere.,25,19
1pz4c3v,,"When he died, it became mine. Same cracked leather strap, same weight on my shoulder, same lingering smell of oil and mold. He died young, only fifty-three.",27,20
1pz4c3v,,"The sewers don’t treat people kindly. The stench… yeah, that part never gets easier. It’s the kind of smell that curls your stomach and sticks to your clothes for days.",30,21
1pz4c3v,,But I got used to it. Patrolling was the boring part.,11,22
1pz4c3v,,"I knew every turn by heart: which bulbs were burned out, where the concrete got slippery, where you had no choice but to step into knee-deep muck.",27,23
1pz4c3v,,That was when the mind wandered. I always found myself thinking about the things my father feared so much. Wondering if they were real.,24,24
1pz4c3v,,"Wondering what my life would look like up there—in the so-called “real world.” Where you go grocery shopping, come home, watch TV, complain about your boss. I couldn’t imagine it.",30,25
1pz4c3v,,"Then something splashed. Hard. A deep, heavy SPLASH that echoed through the tunnels. I froze. Brought the shotgun up, switched on my flashlight.",23,26
1pz4c3v,,"The surface of the water rippled for long seconds, as if something huge had just moved below it… but the beam showed nothing. I couldn’t stay there.",27,27

Nothing.",24,29

1pz4c3v,,And Oliver… he felt too at home down here. More than anyone should. I never liked him. But that didn’t matter now. I was only a few minutes away.,29,32
1pz4c3v,,"I knew exactly where his hideout was: straight down the long dark corridor, past the runoff pipe, then right… all the way to the heavy steel gate.",27,33
1pz4c3v,,That was the first defense post. That was where Oliver was supposed to be. I just hoped I’d find him alive. I stood in front of the big steel door.,30,34
1pz4c3v,,"But there was no sign of Oliver. The door was locked, and I couldn’t even budge it. “Oliver? You in there?” I knocked hard. “Hello?”

Nothing.",26,35

1pz4c3v,,To my left… was only darkness. The part of the system no one ever went into. The place danger came from.,21,38
1pz4c3v,,"As I stared into that black stretch of tunnel, something moved. Slowly. Heavily. Like a massively overweight man struggling to put one foot in front of the other. “Hey!",29,39
1pz4c3v,,Who’s there?!” I raised the shotgun and aimed my flashlight into the dark. I didn’t get a chance to see. Something grabbed me from behind.,25,40
1pz4c3v,,"A strong arm clamped over my mouth. Cold metal pressed against the side of my neck. “Shut up,” a man hissed. “Unless you want them to hear you.”

I froze.",30,41
1pz4c3v,,"The voice was familiar. I managed a tiny nod. A metallic click sounded, and the heavy steel door swung open.",20,42
1pz4c3v,,"The man didn’t release me, he dragged me inside, pulling me backward as the darkness behind us swallowed the corridor.",20,43
1pz4c3v,,"Right before the door shut, I glanced over my shoulder one last time. That huge, lumbering shape was still standing there in the dark. Silent. Waiting.",26,44
1pz4c3v,,But I wasn’t thinking about what it was anymore. I was finally starting to understand why everyone hated Oliver so damn much. Oliver’s bunker was like stepping into another world.,30,45
1pz4c3v,,"Past the steel door, it didn’t even feel like the sewer anymore, it felt like his territory.",17,46
1pz4c3v,,He dragged me all the way to the center of the room before finally letting go.,16,47
1pz4c3v,,"There he stood, half-naked, his oily skin gleaming under the weak light, grinning that gap-toothed, unsettling grin of his, like he was waiting for me to compliment him.",28,48
1pz4c3v,,His bald head shone with sweat. And the smell coming off him… it wasn’t sweat. It was more like machine grease.,21,49
1pz4c3v,,"His smile managed to look friendly and terrifying at the same time. “Well, what’s up, Chucky boy?” he asked once he realized I couldn’t even get a word out.",29,50
1pz4c3v,,"“Your senses wearing down already? Or did that asshole never teach you properly?”

“Don’t talk about my dad like that.” I frowned. “And by the way, Logan’s been calling.",29,51
1pz4c3v,,"Why aren’t you answering him?”

“Ah!” Oliver waved a hand dismissively, rummaging through a pile of tangled cables. “Logan’s just a self-important prick.”

“Oliver…” I sighed.",26,52
1pz4c3v,,"“He’s at the sluice gates. If you don’t check in, he’s going to trigger a lockdown. We’ll both be sealed in this tunnel.”

Oliver looked at me. Not confused.",29,53
1pz4c3v,,"Not surprised. He knew exactly what a lockdown meant. He just didn’t give a shit. He tossed the cables away and darted over to an old, sputtering metal stove.",29,54
1pz4c3v,,"With the kind of recklessness only he had, he grabbed the hot lid with his bare hands and flipped it open.",21,55
1pz4c3v,,He dug around inside with a pair of long tongs and pulled out something charred and shriveled. A rat.,19,56
1pz4c3v,,"“Why the hell are you eating rats, Oliver?” I asked, disgust twisting my stomach as he bit into it. “Gotta eat something,” he said through a mouthful, chewing loudly.",29,57
1pz4c3v,,"“And down here, this is prime protein.”

“That’s disgusting,” I muttered, turning away. “Logan can send supplies whenever, we’re not stuck eating that.”

Oliver didn’t respond.",26,58
1pz4c3v,,"He just kept chewing that burnt thing as if it were a gourmet meal. I shook my head, waiting for him to finish. But he never got the chance.",29,59
1pz4c3v,,"A heavy pounding slammed against the steel door. The sound was sharp, like a fist hitting metal. Hard. Angry. I spun around. Oliver froze mid-chew.",25,60
1pz4c3v,,The smacking and chomping stopped instantly. The entire bunker fell silent. And then: KNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK. Harder this time. Oliver went pale.,22,61
1pz4c3v,,"A cold, ghost-white kind of pale I’d never seen on him before. I saw it clearly, the fear in his eyes. Real fear. The kind you don’t question.",28,62
1pz4c3v,,"“They… they found us,” he whispered, voice trembling. “Get back!” Oliver snapped, jumping to his feet.",16,63
1pz4c3v,,"“Move it, Chuck, this is not the time to drift off!”

My heart was hammering in my throat.",18,64
1pz4c3v,,"I shot up, gripping the shotgun tight, staring at the steel door as it shook harder and harder. “Go!” Oliver barked, yanking me backward. “Run!”

“Okay!” I didn’t think.",29,65
1pz4c3v,,"I just turned and sprinted down the rear corridor. I knew this wasn’t a drill. My whole life, my dad trained me for this exact moment.",26,66
1pz4c3v,,"And still, I was running. Then I heard it: Oliver’s footsteps behind me, followed by his shout:

“Run!",18,67
1pz4c3v,,"MOVE!”

I bolted through the damp tunnel, pipes rattling along the walls, light flickering overhead. A half-lit storage room flashed by, and then—

BAM!",24,68
1pz4c3v,,"I slammed into another heavy steel door, almost knocking myself flat. Oliver was a few yards behind me, his headlamp wobbling wildly as he ran. “Oliver!",26,69
1pz4c3v,,"How the hell does this open?!” I yelled, yanking at the handle. It didn’t budge. “Move, kid!” he shouted, shoving me aside.",22,70
1pz4c3v,,"He started pounding on a tiny switch next to the frame, slapping it over and over like he was trying to wake up a stubborn doorbell.",26,71
1pz4c3v,,"The door didn’t even twitch. He kept hitting it, glancing back every other second. I finally turned too, shotgun tight against my shoulder.",23,72
1pz4c3v,,"Down the corridor, between the pipes, something was coming toward us. Tall. Lanky. Human-shaped… sort of. Water poured off of it.",21,73
1pz4c3v,,"Its skin glistened like wet clay, and long strands of dark green muck hung off its arms and shoulders—like lake weed. My heartbeat stuttered. “Come on!” Oliver roared. “It’s opening!",30,74
1pz4c3v,,"MOVE!”

The door groaned. Clicked. Then slowly, painfully, started to open. Oliver squeezed through and thrust his arm out toward me. I didn’t hesitate for even a second.",28,75
1pz4c3v,,"I grabbed his hand, and he yanked me inside with all his strength. “On your feet! Move!",17,76
1pz4c3v,,"Line up, all of you!”

A voice I didn’t recognize barked the orders at us the moment we stumbled inside.",20,77
1pz4c3v,,"By the time I registered what was happening, we were standing in a massive, dried-out water reservoir. The concrete beneath my boots was cold and slick with moisture.",28,78
1pz4c3v,,"Oliver jumped up immediately and rushed toward one of the men, already talking fast. There were at least twenty guys in the chamber.",23,79
1pz4c3v,,"All of them built like tanks, scarred, filthy, hardened by years down here. Wearing torn gear, carrying rifles, pipes, makeshift flamethrowers. They looked like me… just tougher. More experienced.",29,80
1pz4c3v,,More broken in. I never imagined there were still this many of us guarding the sewers.,16,81
1pz4c3v,,"“They’ve never made it down here, Oliver… You sure they’re coming?” a big, bearded man asked. “Of course they’re coming!” Oliver shouted back.",23,82
1pz4c3v,,"“They’re on our damn heels!”

The bearded man squinted at him, clearly unconvinced, at least until the heavy steel door behind us shook so violently it sounded like a car had slammed into it.",34,83
1pz4c3v,,The whole wall rattled. My lungs forgot how to breathe. Every weapon in the room snapped toward the door at once. “Prep positions!” the bearded man roared. “Everyone! Move!,29,84
1pz4c3v,,"Flamethrowers up front!”

The group scattered instantly, each person finding their designated spot. Metal clanged, rifles clicked, boots scraped. These men knew exactly what they were doing.",27,85
1pz4c3v,,"And they were preparing to die if needed. The bearded man stepped toward me. “You Chuck?”

I nodded.",18,86
1pz4c3v,,"My heart was pounding so hard it felt like it was stuck in my throat. I suddenly felt small, out of place, surrounded by all these hardened fighters.",28,87
1pz4c3v,,"“Good,” he said. He leaned closer. “I knew your father. Hell of a protector.” His expression shifted, hard, serious. “Now it’s your turn.",23,88
1pz4c3v,,"Time to prove what you can do.”

We all stood there, tense and silent. Every weapon in the room was aimed at the steel door.",25,89
1pz4c3v,,"It had stopped shaking, but we knew something was behind it. The smell wasn’t the usual sewer stench, it was worse. Much worse.",23,90
1pz4c3v,,The kind of smell people only describe one way: the smell of death. It didn’t start with a bang. Not even with a heavy impact. It started… with a leak.,30,91
1pz4c3v,,"A brownish-gray sludge began oozing through the hinges of the door. Thick, muddy goo seeping out through every tiny gap—like the door itself was melting.",25,92
1pz4c3v,,"Or like something alive was pressing through it. “Flamethrowers! Do it, NOW!” the bearded man shouted. Two of the sewer guards immediately fired up their makeshift flamethrowers.",27,93
1pz4c3v,,"I heard the gas tanks scream, the pipes rattle as they heated up…and then a torrent of fire blasted out. The flames washed across the steel door.",27,94
1pz4c3v,,"The metal hissed under the heat, and from the other side…Something started to scream. A thin, stretched, high-pitched wail that drilled straight into your skull. Piercing. Inhuman.",27,95
1pz4c3v,,"Then the door exploded off its hinges. It flew forward like a bus had rammed it, slamming into the concrete and sending cracks spiderwebbing across the floor.",27,96
1pz4c3v,,"And behind it… Was the real nightmare. A mass of brownish-gray sludge. Not a creature, not a shape—just a colossal, pulsing mound of living mud that filled the entire hallway.",30,97
1pz4c3v,,"And then, slowly… inevitably… it began to pour into the chamber. The flamethrowers shrieked as they pushed out more heat. Everybody pulled their trigger.",24,98
1pz4c3v,,"Two dozen of us opened fire at once. Gunfire filled the entire chamber. The noise was deafening, so loud it felt like the concrete itself was screaming alongside us.",29,99
1pz4c3v,,"The flamethrowers spat fire toward the mass. I fired too, as fast as I could reload.",16,100
1pz4c3v,,"The shotgun slammed into my shoulder with every blast, but I didn’t care, everyone else’s desperate fighting lit something inside me.",21,101
1pz4c3v,,"For the first time in my life, I felt like a real sewer guard. The mass kept pouring out of the hallway. I watched bullets hit it… and disappear.",29,102
1pz4c3v,,"Just swallowed whole. No effect. Only the fire held it back, every time the flames touched it, the thing recoiled, almost like it was afraid.",25,103
1pz4c3v,,"Then one stream of sludge suddenly stiffened. And slowly… it rose. Its shape pulled together, dripping, reshaping itself into a brownish-gray humanoid figure. A living, slimy mockery of a person.",30,104
1pz4c3v,,"One of the guards ran up and shot it point-blank in the head. The mass-head exploded, splattering the wall behind it with disgusting chunks. He stepped back, triumphant.",28,105
1pz4c3v,,"He never saw the second one forming right behind him. I did. The thing lunged. Hard, like a tidal wave hitting a rock. “HELP! SHOOT ME!",26,106
1pz4c3v,,"PLEASE, JUST SHOOT ME!” the man screamed. Oliver was the one who granted his wish. One fast shot. One final scream. Then silence. After that, everything turned to chaos.",29,107
1pz4c3v,,"More and more mass-creatures formed, rising out of the sludge. No matter how many we blasted apart, they reformed, pulling themselves together like living mud.",25,108
1pz4c3v,,"Two more men were dragged down, swallowed whole, swept away like pebbles in a rushing stream. Nothing stopped these things.",20,109
1pz4c3v,,"“WE HAVE TO RUN!” a young guy in a baseball cap yelled. “You stay right here!” the bearded man roared, grabbing him by the coat. “Oliver!",26,110
1pz4c3v,,"The cans!”

I don’t know how Oliver heard him through all the screaming and gunfire, but he looked up, and nodded.",21,111
1pz4c3v,,"I was right beside him, stomach in knots, hands shaking, but still loading and firing. My pockets were running out of shells fast, and panic was taking over.",28,112
1pz4c3v,,I felt just like that kid in the baseball cap. Like this was the end. Three more men were swallowed by the mass-creatures.,23,113
1pz4c3v,,"They weren’t fast, they weren’t even especially strong… but they were impossible to kill. Every time we tore a piece off them, the sludge pulled itself back together in seconds.",30,114
1pz4c3v,,That’s when something happened I never expected: Oliver kicked open a small metal panel in the wall. It didn’t hide pipes. It didn’t hide reinforcement bars. It hid cans.,29,115
1pz4c3v,,At least twenty of them. Each one rigged with a pull-pin.,11,116
1pz4c3v,,"Oliver grabbed one, ripped out the pin, and hurled it into the mass with the strength of a damn Olympic hammer thrower. The greenish can hit the ground… and exploded.",30,117
1pz4c3v,,"A blinding column of fire shot upward. Even from behind cover, the heatwave scorched my face, burning the air in my lungs.",22,118
1pz4c3v,,"The entire chamber lit up with flame, screams, and shrapnel. And the fight kept going.",15,119
1pz4c3v,,"“Come on, help with the cans!” Oliver screamed at me when he saw the shells spill out of my shaking hands. I just stared at him, frozen.",27,120
1pz4c3v,,Oliver was firing his rifle one-handed while digging for another can with the other. I had to pull myself together.,20,121
1pz4c3v,,"I grabbed my dad’s shotgun, swallowed my fear, and sprinted over to him. From the wall recess, I yanked out one of the cans.",24,122
1pz4c3v,,"The smell of gasoline hit me instantly, it was a heavy, nearly full five-gallon can. “Pull the pin and THROW IT!” Oliver shouted when he saw me fumbling.",28,123
1pz4c3v,,"The pin finally gave way. I spun, hurled the can with everything I had, and it flew straight into the chaos. It exploded almost the moment it hit the floor.",30,124
1pz4c3v,,"A column of fire tore upward, swallowing everything around it. For one heartbeat, I froze, It felt like time stopped. Everything was burning.",23,125
1pz4c3v,,One of our guys caught fire; he screamed and staggered before collapsing. Another was fighting for his life as mass-creatures climbed onto him one after another.,26,126
1pz4c3v,,"A third was already half-consumed, his body sinking into the sludge. The stench of burning flesh mixed with the sizzling stink of the creatures filled the chamber.",27,127
1pz4c3v,,"That’s when it hit me how few of us were left, And how real the chance was that this chamber would become our grave. “Chuck! Wake up!",27,128
1pz4c3v,,"MOVE!” Oliver yanked me back into reality. He tossed another can toward me. “Throw them! GO!”

On autopilot, I pulled another pin, spun, and sent the next can flying.",29,129
1pz4c3v,,"Another explosion. More flames. The heat tore at my skin, but the mass-creatures just kept pouring out of the hall. Every chunk we blasted off them only melted back together.",30,130
1pz4c3v,,"“God DAMN IT!” Oliver shouted. I finally saw why. Two mass-creatures had reached him. One wrapped around his ankle, the other coiled up his arm.",25,131
1pz4c3v,,"Their bodies were swallowing him whole. “Oliver! Give me your hand!” I screamed, grabbing at him, trying to pull him free.",21,132
1pz4c3v,,"“Get outta here, kid!” he roared, shoving me away with his free arm. “RUN!",14,133
1pz4c3v,,"ALL OF YOU!”

Then, with the last strength he had left, he dragged himself toward the remaining cans. I knew exactly what he was about to do.",27,134
1pz4c3v,,"There were still at least ten of them hidden in the wall. “Come on!” the bearded man grabbed my shoulder. “Fall back! EVERYONE OUT!”

Everything blurred after that.",28,135
1pz4c3v,,"We ran through the corridor, water splashing under our boots. From the twenty or so men who’d been with us… barely seven of us were left.",26,136
1pz4c3v,,"I glanced back one last time. And then the explosion hit. The entire chamber lit up in a blinding roar, shaking the tunnel so hard dust fell from the ceiling.",30,137
1pz4c3v,,"Flames shot all the way to the top of the reservoir. Oliver stayed behind. But maybe, just maybe, he stopped the monsters.",22,138
1pz4c3v,,"I sat on the edge of the cold concrete. The wastewater trickled beneath my boots, flowing slowly back toward the chamber, back toward the nightmare we’d barely escaped.",28,139
1pz4c3v,,"“You alright, Chuck?” the bearded man asked, stepping up beside me. “Yeah… I think so,” I muttered.",17,140
1pz4c3v,,"The stench still clung to the inside of my nose: burned flesh, the sour rot of those sludge-creatures, the acidic stink of fire and death.",25,141
1pz4c3v,,"I could still feel the heat on my face, still taste the scorched air in my lungs. “Rest,” he said, patting my shoulder. “You earned it.”

Silence settled over us.",30,142
1pz4c3v,,"“What were those things?” I finally asked. “The filth that comes from above,” he said without hesitation. “Everything people flush away.”

I didn’t respond. What could I have said?",29,143
1pz4c3v,,"For so long I thought we were guarding against invisible threats, that this job was more metaphor than reality. But today… today proved everything. I looked up.",27,144
1pz4c3v,,"Sounds drifted down from above, filtered through an iron manhole cover. Light flickered across the damp concrete, and it sounded like a thousand people were shouting at once. Fireworks.",29,145
1pz4c3v,,"“Happy New Year, kid,” an old man said beside me, forcing a tired smile. He was clutching his hand in pain.",21,146
1pz4c3v,,"The burns were impossible to miss, his skin raw and red, still glowing with heat.",15,147
1pz4c3v,,"“Happy New Year to you too,” I muttered, staring at his hand a second too long before looking away. I tilted my head up again.",25,148
1pz4c3v,,"Through the gaps in the cover, bursts of color flashed, reds, blues, golds, painting the sewer ceiling in brief, beautiful light. Up there, people were cheering. Hugging. Kissing.",28,149
1pz4c3v,,"Making promises they wouldn’t keep. Down here, the wastewater kept flowing. And so did we.",15,150
1pz4c3v,,"I watched the last firework fade and realized something that made my chest tighten:
As long as they were celebrating up there, we would never be done down here.",29,151
1pyyjlw,I Went Urban Exploring Alone. Someone Locked the Exits Behind Me.,I am writing this on my phone with my left hand because my right one is wrapped in gauze and taped to a splint.,24,0
1pyyjlw,,"If you’re going to comment “don’t trespass,” save it. I already learned that part.",14,1
1pyyjlw,,I learned it with blood on a concrete floor and someone close enough behind me that I could smell cigarettes through my own panic. I’m seventeen.,26,2
1pyyjlw,,I live in a town where nothing happens unless it’s the kind of nothing that ruins your week.,18,3
1pyyjlw,,My friends and I watch those urban exploring videos where people wander through dead malls and old factories and it looks quiet. Dusty. Empty. Sad. This was not like that.,30,4
1pyyjlw,,"I went alone because I’m an idiot, and because my friends are all talk.",14,5
1pyyjlw,,"“Yeah bro I’m down,” and then it’s “my mom said no” or “I got work.” I told myself I’d just go in, take a few pictures, and leave before midnight.",30,6
1pyyjlw,,I told myself I’d be smart. I picked the Hollis Distribution Center because everyone in town knows it. Huge gray warehouse off the service road behind the old strip mall.,30,7
1pyyjlw,,"When I was little, trucks were always coming and going.",10,8
1pyyjlw,,"My dad used to point at it and say, “That’s where all your Christmas stuff sits before it gets delivered.”

It shut down last year.",25,9
1pyyjlw,,They chained the gates and put up No Trespassing signs that faded in the sun.,15,10
1pyyjlw,,"People started saying it was empty, then people started saying kids were going in to tag it, then people started saying they heard generators at night.",26,11
1pyyjlw,,That last part should have been my warning.,8,12
1pyyjlw,,"I parked at the back of the strip mall like I was going to the late movie, even though the theater has been closed for years.",26,13
1pyyjlw,,"I took my backpack, my cheap headlamp, a flashlight, and my phone. I wore gloves because of broken glass and I felt stupid the whole time.",26,14
1pyyjlw,,Like I was dressing up as someone brave. The service road was cracked and littered with shredded tire pieces.,19,15
1pyyjlw,,"I could see the warehouse over the weeds, a long wall with loading bay doors like sealed mouths. No lights inside. No movement.",23,16
1pyyjlw,,I found an opening at the far end where the chain link fence had been cut and bent back. Not ripped by a storm.,24,17
1pyyjlw,,"Cut clean, like someone used tools and did it on purpose. My stomach did that quick dip. The part of my brain that still works said go home.",28,18
1pyyjlw,,"Then the other part said it’s just other explorers. I slipped through and walked along the wall, keeping my light off. The air smelled like wet cardboard and old oil.",30,19
1pyyjlw,,"Somewhere, a loose metal sign clinked softly in the wind. There was a side door, steel, with a push bar.",20,20
1pyyjlw,,"It had a fresh scrape near the handle, shiny where paint had been rubbed off. I pushed. It opened without resistance. Inside, my phone didn’t “fade” to no service.",29,21
1pyyjlw,,"It just flipped to SOS and then to nothing, like the building swallowed it. I told myself it was the thick concrete and all the metal. Warehouses are dead zones.",30,22
1pyyjlw,,"I’ve lost signal in my own school stairwell. Still, the timing made my skin prickle. The silence hit right after, big and flat.",23,23
1pyyjlw,,The first room was an office area with glass panes and dusty desks.,13,24
1pyyjlw,,Someone had smashed a window and the glass had been swept into a neat pile in the corner. Not scattered. Not random.,22,25
1pyyjlw,,"A neat pile, like whoever did it didn’t want to step on it. There was a smell in there too. Not mold. Something sharper.",24,26
1pyyjlw,,"Warmed plastic, and a faint tang like exhaust that didn’t belong in a room that was supposed to be cold and dead.",22,27
1pyyjlw,,"I moved deeper, past the office, into the main floor. The warehouse opened up like an airplane hangar. Rows of empty shelving reached into the dark.",26,28
1pyyjlw,,"Conveyor belts ran overhead, frozen in mid-motion, their rollers dull with dust. Yellow safety lines were painted on the concrete, worn from years of forklifts.",25,29
1pyyjlw,,My flashlight caught a sign on a pillar about required PPE and forklift traffic. The kind of sign you don’t even see when you’re working because it’s just there.,29,30
1pyyjlw,,"Then I saw fresh boot prints. Near a side entrance where mud had dried in a streak, there were clear treads. Wide heel.",23,31
1pyyjlw,,"Recent enough that the mud was still darker than the concrete around it. I stopped and listened. Nothing. Then, far off, something clicked.",23,32
1pyyjlw,,"Not the random pop of a settling building. A deliberate click, like a switch.",14,33
1pyyjlw,,"I whispered, “Hello?” which was the dumbest thing I could have done because it told whoever was in there that I was real and I was alone. No answer.",29,34
1pyyjlw,,"I kept walking anyway, slower, trying to find the obvious “people hang out here” spot. That’s what those videos always show. Spray paint cans. A mattress. Beer bottles.",28,35
1pyyjlw,,"I found something worse. Near the center of the building, under one of the conveyor lines, there was a folding chair facing a blank wall.",25,36
1pyyjlw,,"Just one chair, centered like it was placed for a reason.",11,37
1pyyjlw,,"On the floor in front of it were three chalk marks in a little triangle, like someone had been measuring distance.",21,38
1pyyjlw,,"On the chair was a cheap set of ear protection, the kind you’d wear around loud machinery. My throat tightened. I backed up without thinking, my heel scraping concrete.",29,39
1pyyjlw,,"From somewhere in the dark, a sound answered my scrape. A soft shuffle. One step. Then stillness. I killed my flashlight and froze. Total dark.",25,40
1pyyjlw,,I listened so hard my ears hurt. Breathing. My own. Too loud. Then I heard it again. Another step. Closer.,20,41
1pyyjlw,,"I turned my flashlight back on and swung it across the aisles, trying to catch movement. Nothing. But the feeling changed. The warehouse didn’t feel empty anymore. It felt occupied.",30,42
1pyyjlw,,"Like the air had shifted around a body. I started walking back the way I came, fast but trying not to run.",22,43
1pyyjlw,,Running in a warehouse is how you fall into a hole or hit your head and nobody finds you. I passed the office again and aimed for the side door.,30,44
1pyyjlw,,The door was closed. It had been open. I knew it had. I could still picture the push bar.,19,45
1pyyjlw,,"Now it was shut, and the thin gap of light under it was gone. I reached for it, pulled, and the door didn’t budge. Locked.",25,46
1pyyjlw,,My hand went numb around the handle. I tugged harder. Nothing. I put my shoulder into it. Metal rang. Still nothing. That was the moment the fear got simple.,29,47
1pyyjlw,,"Not creepy fear. Survival fear. Someone is in here with me, and they can lock doors. I turned, scanning the office.",21,48
1pyyjlw,,There was a security desk near the hallway that led deeper into the building. On the desk was a clipboard with a paper that said VISITOR LOG at the top.,30,49
1pyyjlw,,"It looked old, but the pen beside it didn’t. The pen was clean, like it had been placed that day. I don’t know why I did it.",27,50
1pyyjlw,,My hands were shaking and I wanted them to do something that wasn’t yanking on a locked door. I wrote my first name on the log.,26,51
1pyyjlw,,"Just “Eli,” and the time. I didn’t even think. I wrote it like a joke, like I could laugh later about signing into a dead building.",26,52
1pyyjlw,,"The ink looked too dark on the page, too fresh. I regretted it immediately. I went down the hallway instead, trying to find another exit.",25,53
1pyyjlw,,At the end of the hall was a stairwell door. I pushed it open. Cold air hit my face. The stairwell smelled like wet cement and rust.,27,54
1pyyjlw,,"Metal stairs went up to a second level, probably a maintenance mezzanine. I stepped inside and pulled the door shut behind me. The latch clicked.",25,55
1pyyjlw,,"Then, behind it, I heard a soft tap. Knuckle on metal. Once. Then again, slow. Tap. Tap. Not banging. Not trying to break in.",24,56
1pyyjlw,,Just letting me know they were there. I backed up a step onto the stairs. Tap. Tap. The tapping stopped. A few seconds of nothing.,25,57
1pyyjlw,,"Then I heard the latch move on the other side. A quiet sliding sound. The door handle turned. It didn’t open. But it turned, like someone was testing it.",29,58
1pyyjlw,,"Then, very softly, a voice said from the other side, “You lost?”

It wasn’t a monster voice. It wasn’t a whispery ghost voice.",23,59
1pyyjlw,,"It was a normal adult voice, calm and almost bored. That terrified me more than anything. I didn’t answer. The voice sighed like I was inconveniencing them.",27,60
1pyyjlw,,"“Wrong place to be,” it said. “Come on. Let’s get you out.”

The words sounded helpful. The tone didn’t. I backed up another step. My shoe scraped metal. Silence.",29,61
1pyyjlw,,"I started up the stairs, faster now. The metal clanged under my feet. I hated every sound I made but I couldn’t stop. Halfway up, the stairwell lights came on.",30,62
1pyyjlw,,"Not full bright. A flicker, then steady industrial glow. The kind you get when power comes to a place that’s supposed to be dead.",24,63
1pyyjlw,,"I froze, staring up at the fixture. Dust drifted through the light like slow snow. Below me, the stairwell door clicked open. I did not look back.",27,64
1pyyjlw,,I ran up the rest of the stairs and pulled myself onto the upper landing. The upper level was a long catwalk running along the inside wall of the warehouse.,30,65
1pyyjlw,,Grated metal floor. Safety rail. From up there I could see almost everything below. Shelving rows. Conveyor belts. The chair. And now I could see the generator.,27,66
1pyyjlw,,A small portable generator sat tucked behind a stack of pallets near the far wall. The little fuel cap glinted in my beam.,23,67
1pyyjlw,,A heavy extension cord ran from it into a junction box. Someone had taped a label on the box with a strip of white tape and black marker.,28,68
1pyyjlw,,"It said “LIGHTS / PA.”

My stomach dropped again. Whoever was here didn’t just sneak in. They set up power on purpose.",22,69
1pyyjlw,,They planned to turn the building on when they wanted. I heard footsteps on the stairs behind me. Slow. Patient.,20,70
1pyyjlw,,"Like the person wasn’t worried about catching me because they already knew where I could and couldn’t go. I moved along the catwalk, flashlight sweeping for a way down.",29,71
1pyyjlw,,"There was a ladder in the distance, and a second stairwell on the far side. I chose the ladder because it was closer. My hands shook as I ran.",29,72
1pyyjlw,,The grate under my shoes made a hollow clatter. The warehouse threw the sound back at me. The footsteps behind me stayed steady. Not sprinting. Just following.,27,73
1pyyjlw,,I reached the ladder and started down. It was bolted to the wall and dropped to the floor near a row of shelving.,23,74
1pyyjlw,,"I was halfway down when something hit the catwalk above me. A heavy thud, like a boot kicked the metal. The ladder vibrated. My hands slipped. I climbed faster.",29,75
1pyyjlw,,My glove caught on a sharp edge and tore. My bare palm scraped metal and pain flared. I dropped the last few feet instead of climbing properly.,27,76
1pyyjlw,,"My feet hit concrete hard. I stumbled forward, catching myself by slamming my shoulder into a shelf upright.",18,77
1pyyjlw,,"Above me, on the catwalk, a figure leaned on the rail and watched. I only saw them for a second in my flashlight beam. Adult. Dark jacket.",27,78
1pyyjlw,,"A headlamp on their forehead, but it was off. Face kept in shadow. They didn’t yell. They didn’t threaten me.",20,79
1pyyjlw,,"They raised one hand, slow, and pointed toward the aisle in front of me like they were directing traffic. I ran.",21,80
1pyyjlw,,"I wove between shelving, trying to use the rows like cover.",11,81
1pyyjlw,,"I kept expecting them to jump down and chase me, but the footsteps stayed above for a bit, tracking, then stopped. I couldn’t tell if that was good or worse.",30,82
1pyyjlw,,I found a side exit door near one of the loading bays. It had a panic bar and a chain looped through the handles from the inside.,27,83
1pyyjlw,,"Not a normal chain. A thick one, like someone brought it from home. The padlock looked new, shiny, almost proud of itself. I yanked the door anyway. The chain held.",30,84
1pyyjlw,,"I turned and looked for another way out, and that’s when the lights cut out. Not gradually. Off. Darkness snapped back in.",22,85
1pyyjlw,,"My flashlight was still on, but the warehouse swallowed the beam. Everything beyond a few yards was black. Then the PA system crackled overhead.",24,86
1pyyjlw,,"A speaker popped and hissed, then a voice came through, slightly distorted. A recording at first. “Hello?”

Pause. Then it said, “Eli.”

My knees went watery.",26,87
1pyyjlw,,"The name came again, clearer. “Eli.”

I felt my stomach turn cold, because I knew exactly how it happened. I could see the clipboard. The pen. My own handwriting.",29,88
1pyyjlw,,"The calm voice returned, live this time. “I told you it’s the wrong place,” it said. “Now you’re making noise.",20,89
1pyyjlw,,"People hear noise.”

I spun in a slow circle, trying to see where the voice came from. It could have been anywhere.",22,90
1pyyjlw,,My flashlight beam caught something hanging from a shelf upright. A strip of reflective tape. Bright orange. Then another on the next upright. And the next. A path.,28,91
1pyyjlw,,"A line of orange markers, spaced just far enough apart to pull your eyes along the aisle. The voice on the PA said, “Follow the tape.",26,92
1pyyjlw,,"You’ll get out.”

It sounded like a test. It sounded like a trap. I did not follow the tape. I turned and ran in the opposite direction.",27,93
1pyyjlw,,"That decision probably saved my life and it also got me hurt. I sprinted down an aisle, cut left, then right, trying to head back toward the office windows.",29,94
1pyyjlw,,"I figured even if the door was locked, I could break glass and crawl out. I didn’t care about trespassing charges anymore. I cared about daylight and people.",28,95
1pyyjlw,,My flashlight beam bounced. Shadows jumped. Shelf columns turned into bodies for a split second and then steel again. Then my foot caught something low across the floor.,28,96
1pyyjlw,,"I didn’t see it until it hit my shin. It wasn’t a wire. It was a strap, like a ratchet strap laid across the aisle at ankle height, pulled tight.",30,97
1pyyjlw,,"My legs went out from under me. I hit the concrete hard, shoulder first, then my face. My teeth clacked together so hard I thought one cracked.",27,98
1pyyjlw,,"My flashlight flew and spun, painting circles across the shelves. Before I could scramble up, something heavy landed on my backpack and pinned it. Not a boot on my spine.",30,99
1pyyjlw,,Not a knee on my neck. Just enough weight to trap me in place.,14,100
1pyyjlw,,"I bucked and twisted, trying to get free, and that’s when my right hand slid across something sharp. Pain ripped through my palm. Real, hot pain. Glass.",27,101
1pyyjlw,,"Someone had scattered broken glass right where you’d catch yourself. I jerked my hand back and saw blood immediately, bright in the flashlight beam. I tried to close my fingers.",30,102
1pyyjlw,,"They didn’t listen right away. Above me, the calm voice spoke, not through the PA this time. Right behind my head.",21,103
1pyyjlw,,"“You really should’ve followed the tape.”

I couldn’t see him. My face was pressed to the floor. The flashlight was angled wrong.",22,104
1pyyjlw,,"I could only see his shadow stretching across the concrete. He didn’t sound excited. He sounded mildly annoyed, like I made his night harder. I kicked backward.",27,105
1pyyjlw,,"My heel hit something, maybe his shin, because the weight on my backpack shifted. That tiny shift was all I needed.",21,106
1pyyjlw,,"I yanked my arm free of the straps, crawled out of my backpack like I was shedding it, grabbed my flashlight, and ran one-handed.",24,107
1pyyjlw,,Blood ran down my wrist into my glove. My hand throbbed in time with my heartbeat.,16,108
1pyyjlw,,"The PA system crackled again, and the live voice said, “Now you’re bleeding in my building.”

Like I owed him an apology.",22,109
1pyyjlw,,"I ran toward the office area, following memory, not tape. I could taste metal in my mouth. My ankle burned from the fall, but I couldn’t slow down.",28,110
1pyyjlw,,I shoved through the office and saw the glass panes. I raised my flashlight like a hammer and swung. The glass spiderwebbed but didn’t fall. Safety glass.,27,111
1pyyjlw,,"Of course it was safety glass. Footsteps hit the office threshold behind me, closer now. I grabbed a chair and swung it into the glass again.",26,112
1pyyjlw,,This time it shattered outward in thick chunks. The noise was insane in the small space. Cold air rushed in.,20,113
1pyyjlw,,I climbed up using my left hand and shoved my injured right through anyway because there was no other option. The broken edge tore my sleeve.,26,114
1pyyjlw,,"I dropped outside, landing wrong. My ankle rolled and pain shot up my leg. I almost went down again. Behind me, the window popped as someone climbed through.",28,115
1pyyjlw,,"I ran anyway. I limped-run toward the bent fence opening, one hand clamped over my palm, leaving wet prints on my forearm.",22,116
1pyyjlw,,"Behind me, the calm voice called out, almost casually, “Eli.”

Not yelling. Not panicking. Calling like you call a dog that slipped its leash.",24,117
1pyyjlw,,"I got through the fence, scraping my back on the chain link. I didn’t care. I hit the service road and stumbled toward the strip mall lights.",27,118
1pyyjlw,,My car was a dark shape at the far end. I fumbled the keys with my left hand and nearly dropped them twice.,23,119
1pyyjlw,,"I got inside and locked the doors so fast my fingers cramped. For a second I just sat there, panting, staring at the warehouse in the distance. Nothing moved.",29,120
1pyyjlw,,No flashlight beam chased me across the road. It was like the building swallowed him again. I drove straight to the hospital. I didn’t stop. I didn’t call my friends.,30,121
1pyyjlw,,I didn’t call my mom until I was sitting under fluorescent lights with a paper wristband on and a nurse telling me not to look.,25,122
1pyyjlw,,The waiting room smelled like coffee and antiseptic. A kid across from me had an ice pack pressed to his forehead and was trying not to cry.,27,123
1pyyjlw,,The TV was on a news channel with the volume down. Every few minutes a triage door opened and that same bright smell of disinfectant rolled out.,27,124
1pyyjlw,,They cleaned my hand.,4,125
1pyyjlw,,The cut was deep enough that they asked me to try to curl my fingers and then looked at each other when my ring finger didn’t move right away.,29,126
1pyyjlw,,"They numbed it and stitched it anyway. The numbing shot burned like fire for two seconds and then my palm felt huge and distant, like it belonged to someone else.",30,127
1pyyjlw,,"They wrapped it tight and put my hand in a splint. They X-rayed my ankle. Not broken, but bad enough that they wrapped it and handed me crutches.",28,128
1pyyjlw,,"While I sat there, still shaking, my phone buzzed. A message request on an app I barely use anymore. No profile picture. No name. Just one line.",27,129
1pyyjlw,,"“You forgot something.”

That was it. No details. No proof. No photo. It should have been nothing. It made me feel sick anyway. The police took a report.",28,130
1pyyjlw,,My mom was furious in the way people get when they’re scared and don’t know what else to do with it. The officer asked if I saw his face.,29,131
1pyyjlw,,"I didn’t. I told them about the generator, the orange tape, the strap, the PA system, the chained doors. I told them I signed the visitor log like an idiot.",30,132
1pyyjlw,,The officer wrote it down and looked at me like he wanted it to fit into a neat box. Trespasser. Squatter. Scrapper. But those words don’t explain the tape path.,30,133
1pyyjlw,,They don’t explain the labeled junction box. They don’t explain the way he spoke to me like this was routine.,20,134
1pyyjlw,,"Two days later my friend drove past the warehouse in daylight, just to see if anything looked different. He sent me pictures. The cut fence had been fixed. Not patched.",30,135
1pyyjlw,,"Replaced. New chain link, new ties, straight as a ruler. The side door I used was painted over, fresh gray paint like someone cared about the place suddenly.",28,136
1pyyjlw,,"The No Trespassing signs were new too, crisp, with a phone number for a property management company.",17,137
1pyyjlw,,"There was also a new camera bubble mounted above the corner of the office wing, like the kind you see outside grocery stores.",23,138
1pyyjlw,,Maybe it was always there and I never noticed. Maybe it wasn’t. My friend called the number out of curiosity. It went to a voicemail box that wasn’t set up.,30,139
1pyyjlw,,Maybe it was just a guy who didn’t want kids in his building. Maybe it was someone running something illegal and I got too close.,25,140
1pyyjlw,,"I can live with that explanation, even if it makes my stomach turn. What I can’t stop thinking about is how fast it all tightened around me.",27,141
1pyyjlw,,I handed over my name because I wanted to pretend I wasn’t scared. And he used it like a leash.,20,142
1pyyjlw,,"So if you’re a kid like me and you see an “abandoned” building and you think it’s just a place to take pictures, listen. If the glass is swept.",29,143
1pyyjlw,,If the doors lock from the inside. If the lights come on when you didn’t touch a thing. Leave.,19,144
1pyyjlw,,"And if someone offers to “help you out” in a voice that’s too calm, do not answer. Get out before they learn anything they can repeat back to you.",29,145
1pyyibi,We Took a Detour and Found a Diner That Shouldn’t Exist,"We called it the trip of the year, a chance to break free from the suffocating grind of college life, an impulsive decision born over too many late-night study sessions and caffeine highs.",33,0
1pyyibi,,"Our destination was supposed to be an adventure, a cabin in the mountains where we could forget about exams and papers, at least for a weekend.",26,1
1pyyibi,,"But what we got was something else entirely. The three of us had always been close, each of us playing a part in our peculiar little trio.",27,2
1pyyibi,,"There was me, Jason, the designated driver and unofficial planner.",10,3
1pyyibi,,"I liked to think of myself as the one who kept us grounded, the one who knew how to read a map or change a tire when things went wrong.",30,4
1pyyibi,,"The others liked to joke that I was born thirty years too late, that my knack for analog solutions and my mistrust of GPS meant I was more suited to road trips of the '80s than the tech-filled caravans of today.",41,5
1pyyibi,,"Then there was Leah. Leah was the spark, the reason this trip existed in the first place.",17,6
1pyyibi,,"She was always the one with the ideas, the kind that started with “Wouldn’t it be crazy if…?” and ended up with us sneaking into the campus library after hours or setting out at midnight for a spontaneous drive to the coast.",42,7
1pyyibi,,"Leah had a wild spirit, the type that made you believe anything could be fun as long as she was around.",21,8
1pyyibi,,"She was impulsive, unpredictable, and exactly the kind of person you wanted next to you when life started feeling too routine. And finally, there was Eric.",26,9
1pyyibi,,"Eric was the quiet one, thoughtful, skeptical, but always game once Leah managed to convince him.",16,10
1pyyibi,,He was the kind of guy who preferred stability over chaos but found himself often choosing chaos simply because Leah and I were his friends.,25,11
1pyyibi,,"He kept a book in his backpack at all times, claiming you never knew when you might get a chance to read.",22,12
1pyyibi,,"Leah teased him about it endlessly, but deep down, we both knew that Eric’s bookish demeanor kept us from wandering too far into dangerous territory, at least most of the time.",31,13
1pyyibi,,"The trip had started out smooth enough. The plan was simple: leave campus Friday afternoon, drive for a few hours, and reach the cabin by nightfall.",26,14
1pyyibi,,"We were armed with snacks, a playlist Leah had curated called “Songs for Escaping Reality,” and Eric’s stack of travel guides and trail maps.",24,15
1pyyibi,,"“I swear, this playlist is going to change your life,” Leah said, grinning as she cranked up the volume.",19,16
1pyyibi,,"The first notes of a classic rock song blared through the speakers, and she started nodding her head to the beat.",21,17
1pyyibi,,"Eric rolled his eyes, but a smile tugged at his lips. “Yeah, yeah, until you play that one weird techno track that you always sneak in.”

“Oh, come on!",29,18
1pyyibi,,"It’s all part of the experience,” Leah shot back, winking at me in the rearview mirror.",16,19
1pyyibi,,"“As long as it keeps us awake,” I said, keeping my eyes on the road.",15,20
1pyyibi,,The sky was blushing with the colors of sunset as we left behind the sprawling cityscape and ventured into the countryside. Everything was perfect until it wasn’t.,27,21
1pyyibi,,"A detour sign appeared on the road where none should have been, and our GPS lost its signal somewhere in the rolling hills. ""Uh, that's weird.",26,22
1pyyibi,,"Was this detour here last time?"" I asked, frowning as I slowed down. Leah leaned forward, squinting at the sign. ""Who cares? It’s an adventure, right?",26,23
1pyyibi,,"Besides, what's the worst that could happen?"" She flashed a grin, her enthusiasm infectious as always. Eric, sitting in the back, sighed. ""I don't know, guys.",26,24
1pyyibi,,"Detours that aren't on maps tend to end up in horror movies,"" he said, but there was a hint of a smile on his face. ""Oh, come on, Eric.",29,25
1pyyibi,,"Don’t be such a buzzkill,"" Leah teased. ""I promise, if we end up in a horror movie, I’ll save you first.""

""That’s reassuring,"" Eric replied, rolling his eyes.",28,26
1pyyibi,,"We weren’t worried, not at first. I had maps, after all, and Leah had a sixth sense for adventure.",19,27
1pyyibi,,"We laughed about it, teasing each other as the sun dipped lower, the horizon melting into a deep, inky blue.",20,28
1pyyibi,,"The mood was light, Leah making jokes about the ""mystery road"" and Eric reluctantly joining in. ""Maybe we'll find buried treasure,"" Leah said, her voice tinged with excitement.",28,29
1pyyibi,,"""Or a cult,"" Eric added, shaking his head.",8,30
1pyyibi,,"""Hopefully not a cult.""

We passed fields and forests, the headlights cutting through an increasingly lonely road, the kind where you started to forget you were even part of the world anymore.",32,31
1pyyibi,,"It was Leah who first pointed it out... the flickering neon sign glowing faintly in the distance. “The Last Stop Café,” it read, in faded letters.",26,32
1pyyibi,,"Leah was thrilled, immediately insisting we pull over.",8,33
1pyyibi,,"She called it a “classic roadside experience,” her enthusiasm spilling over into her voice as she spoke of milkshakes and greasy fries served in places just like this.",28,34
1pyyibi,,"Eric sighed, a small reluctant smile tugging at his lips as he nodded. “Might as well. We’re lost anyway,” he muttered, glancing at me. I hesitated.",26,35
1pyyibi,,"“Come on, Jason, where’s your sense of adventure?” Leah’s voice broke through my thoughts. She leaned in, her eyes sparkling.",20,36
1pyyibi,,"“I bet they have the best milkshakes.”

“Yeah, the kind with extra mystery ingredients,” Eric said drily, but he was already unbuckling his seatbelt.",24,37
1pyyibi,,"The gravel crunched beneath the tires as we pulled into the lot, the diner standing solitary under the night sky, its windows glowing an eerie yellow.",26,38
1pyyibi,,"The place seemed oddly empty. “Anyone else getting a weird vibe from this place?” I asked, trying to keep my tone light. Leah laughed, already halfway out of the car.",30,39
1pyyibi,,"“You always think too much, Jason. It’s just a diner!”

Eric shrugged. “Let’s just grab something to eat. It’s probably fine.” He paused, looking at the darkened road behind us.",30,40
1pyyibi,,"“Though it is kind of… isolated.”

“But that’s what makes it an adventure!” Leah declared, stretching her arms. She turned to me with a grin. “Besides, I’m starving.",28,41
1pyyibi,,"Let’s go!”

I followed them toward the entrance. The door creaked open and we stepped inside.",16,42
1pyyibi,,"The diner was small, with red vinyl booths and a long counter lined with chrome stools. A lone waitress stood behind the counter, giving us a polite smile.",28,43
1pyyibi,,"""Welcome in, folks,"" she said, her voice warm. ""Sit wherever you'd like.""

Leah immediately pointed to a booth near the window. ""That one!",23,44
1pyyibi,,"It’s got the best view,"" she said, practically bouncing over to it. Eric and I followed, settling into the booth.",20,45
1pyyibi,,"I couldn’t help but notice how empty the diner was, just us and a few other patrons who seemed lost in their own world.",24,46
1pyyibi,,"As I looked closer, I noticed the other patrons more carefully. There was a man sitting alone at the counter, staring into a cup of coffee.",26,47
1pyyibi,,"In the corner booth, an elderly couple sat side by side, neither of them speaking.",15,48
1pyyibi,,"The woman was looking out the window, her expression blank, while the man seemed to be fixated on a spot on the table, his lips moving as if he were muttering something under his breath.",35,49
1pyyibi,,"Eric followed my gaze and raised an eyebrow. ""Not exactly the liveliest bunch, huh?""

Leah shrugged. ""Hey, it’s late. People are tired.",22,50
1pyyibi,,"Besides, it’s kind of nice to have the place mostly to ourselves.""

The waitress approached our table.",17,51
1pyyibi,,"She handed us the menus without a word, her demeanor far less welcoming than before, and left without waiting for a response. Leah opened her menu first, her eyes widening.",30,52
1pyyibi,,"""Whoa, guys, check this out. There are actual rules in here. Like... rules for eating at a diner?""

""Rules?"" Eric asked, raising an eyebrow as he flipped open his menu.",30,53
1pyyibi,,"""What kind of rules?""

I glanced at my own menu, noticing a laminated page right at the front titled 'House Rules'. Leah cleared her throat dramatically and began reading aloud.",30,54
1pyyibi,,"""Rule 1: Do not ask the staff about the diner's history,"" she said, pausing for effect. ""Oh no, we can’t talk about the mysterious past of the creepy diner.",29,55
1pyyibi,,"What a shame.""

Eric snorted. ""Yeah, right. Like anyone actually cares about that.""

Leah continued, her voice dripping with playful sarcasm. ""Rule 2: Do not enter the restroom alone.",29,56
1pyyibi,,"Well, I guess I'm on my own if I need to go. Thanks for nothing, guys.""

I chuckled. ""Maybe they’re just really big on safety.",25,57
1pyyibi,,"Or maybe they just don't want anyone wandering off and getting lost in their haunted bathroom.""

""Rule 3: If the neon sign outside flickers, close your eyes until it stops,"" Leah read, her eyebrows shooting up.",36,58
1pyyibi,,"""Close your eyes?",3,59
1pyyibi,,"Are they worried about seizures or something?""

""Rule 4: Avoid the kitchen at all costs, even if you hear someone calling for help,"" I read aloud, raising an eyebrow.",29,60
1pyyibi,,"""Well, that’s oddly specific.""

Leah grinned. ""Maybe they just don't want us to steal their secret recipes.""

""Or maybe it's where they keep the bodies,"" Eric added, his tone deadpan.",30,61
1pyyibi,,"""Rule 5: If someone sits in the booth across from you with a blurry face, do not speak to them,"" I read aloud, glancing at Leah and Eric. ""Blurry face?",30,62
1pyyibi,,"What does that even mean?""

Eric laughed.",7,63
1pyyibi,,"""Maybe they just don’t want us talking to strangers.""

""Rule 6: If the power goes out, stay seated and do not speak until the lights return,"" Leah read, her smile fading slightly.",32,64
1pyyibi,,"""Okay, that one’s just creepy.""

""Probably just a gimmick to make the place seem spooky,"" I said, trying to keep the mood light. Leah nodded, then read the next one.",30,65
1pyyibi,,"""Rule 7: Never turn around if someone taps you on the shoulder.""

""Rule 8: Do not answer if your name is called by someone you don’t recognize,"" Eric read, his voice taking on a mock-serious tone.",36,66
1pyyibi,,"""I guess no new friends for us tonight.""

""No complaints here,"" I said, chuckling. Eric flipped to the next rule.",20,67
1pyyibi,,"""Rule 9: Do not look under the table for any reason.""

""Okay, now they’re just messing with us,"" he said, shaking his head.",23,68
1pyyibi,,I took a deep breath before reading the last rule.,10,69
1pyyibi,,"""And finally, Rule 10: Under no circumstances should you leave the diner before 3:00 a.m."" 

""I guess we’re stuck here for a while,"" I said, attempting to lighten the mood but failing to hide the unease.",36,70
1pyyibi,,"""Hope they really do have good milkshakes.""

Leah waved her hand dismissively, her grin still intact. ""Oh, come on, Jason. It's just a cool marketing gimmick.",26,71
1pyyibi,,"You know, like, come for the creepy rules, stay for the food.""

Eric nodded, though he seemed to notice my tone. ""Yeah, it’s definitely giving off haunted attraction vibes.",29,72
1pyyibi,,They probably get a lot of late-night thrill-seekers in here.,10,73
1pyyibi,,"I just hope the food lives up to the hype.""

We turned our attention back to the menus, scanning through the classic diner options.",24,74
1pyyibi,,"Leah tapped her finger against the table, deciding between a burger and a milkshake. ""I think I'll go for the double cheeseburger and a chocolate shake.",26,75
1pyyibi,,"You can't go wrong with the classics, right?""

""I'm getting the pancakes,"" Eric said. ""Breakfast for dinner never disappoints.""

""I guess I'll go with the burger, too.",27,76
1pyyibi,,"And maybe some fries to share,"" I added. The waitress approached again, her demeanor just as cold as before.",19,77
1pyyibi,,"She pulled out her notepad and asked, ""Ready to order?""

Leah smiled up at her. ""Yeah, I'll take the double cheeseburger with a chocolate milkshake.""

Eric nodded.",27,78
1pyyibi,,"""Pancakes for me, please. And a coffee.""

""Burger and fries, and a coffee for me,"" I said.",17,79
1pyyibi,,"The waitress scribbled down our orders without a word, her eyes barely meeting ours. As she turned to leave, Leah spoke up, her tone playful. ""So, about these rules...",29,80
1pyyibi,,"Are they just for fun, or do you actually have people trying to break them?""

The waitress paused, her back still to us.",23,81
1pyyibi,,"Slowly, she turned, her expression more serious than ever. ""The rules are there for a reason,"" she said, her voice cold and unwavering. ""You should follow them.",27,82
1pyyibi,,"Every one of them.""

Leah laughed, clearly amused. ""Wow, you're really committed to the bit. It definitely keeps the creepy vibe alive.""

Eric nodded in agreement.",26,83
1pyyibi,,"""Yeah, it adds to the atmosphere. Very immersive.""

The waitress didn't respond. She simply turned and walked away, her footsteps echoing again in the empty diner. I couldn't help myself.",30,84
1pyyibi,,"I called after her, a smirk on my face. ""Hey, what about the history of this place? Any ghost stories we should know about?""

The waitress froze mid-step.",28,85
1pyyibi,,"Her body stiffened, and she turned her head slightly, just enough for me to catch a glimpse of her eyes... wide, almost terrified.",23,86
1pyyibi,,"Suddenly, the lights in the diner flickered, dimming until they cast only the faintest glow.",15,87
1pyyibi,,"The air grew heavy, and a cold shiver ran down my spine as I felt it... a presence, a sensation of someone breathing down my neck.",26,88
1pyyibi,,"The laughter from Leah and Eric seemed to fade, and suddenly, I realized the diner was silent, too silent.",19,89
1pyyibi,,"My eyes darted around, and to my growing horror, I saw that Leah and Eric were no longer there.",19,90
1pyyibi,,"The booth across from me was empty, as if they had never been there at all.",16,91
1pyyibi,,"My heart pounded in my ears as I slowly turned my head, feeling the intense pressure of something right behind me. I turned fully.",24,92
1pyyibi,,"Inches away from my face was a figure, a blurry, pale face staring straight at me, its eyes wide and hollow.",21,93
1pyyibi,,"It was there for just a split second, but it was enough to send a jolt of fear through me.",20,94
1pyyibi,,"I gasped and jerked back instinctively, my body colliding with the table.",12,95
1pyyibi,,"I lost my balance, falling hard onto the floor, the sound of the crash echoing in the empty diner.",19,96
1pyyibi,,"Suddenly, the lights flickered back to full brightness, and Leah and Eric's laughter filled the air again, as if nothing had happened. ""Nice one, Jason,"" Leah said, still grinning.",29,97
1pyyibi,,"""Really going all in on the creepy vibe, huh?""

Eric chuckled, shaking his head. ""Bravo! I like how you're getting into character.",22,98
1pyyibi,,"Keeps things interesting.""

I forced a smile, but my eyes darted around the diner. Something had happened, something real.",19,99
1pyyibi,,"I could still feel the lingering coldness, and a sense of wrongness gnawed at me. I leaned forward, lowering my voice. ""Guys, I'm serious. There was something behind me.",29,100
1pyyibi,,"I felt it. The lights, everything just went... off.""

Leah rolled her eyes, still grinning. ""Oh, come on, Jason. Don't try to freak us out now.",26,101
1pyyibi,,"You're just adding to the atmosphere, right?""

Eric shook his head, his smile not quite fading. ""Yeah, man.",18,102
1pyyibi,,"I gotta admit, you're doing a good job keeping the creepy vibe alive. But seriously, relax.""

I opened my mouth to argue, but Leah nudged me playfully.",27,103
1pyyibi,,"""Bravo on the acting, by the way. Really sold it.",10,104
1pyyibi,,"Now let's just enjoy our food when it gets here.""

I tried to shake off the feeling, but the cold dread settled deep in my chest, refusing to leave.",29,105
1pyyibi,,"It felt like something had changed, and I couldn't quite put it out of my mind. A few moments later, the waitress returned, balancing a tray with our orders.",29,106
1pyyibi,,"She set down Leah's cheeseburger and milkshake, Eric's pancakes, and my burger and fries.",14,107
1pyyibi,,"The food looked surprisingly good, steam rising from the plates, and for a moment, I almost forgot the strange encounter. ""Finally!",21,108
1pyyibi,,"I'm starving,"" Leah said, rubbing her hands together before diving into her burger. ""Pancakes look decent,"" Eric added, pouring syrup over them.",22,109
1pyyibi,,"""Not bad for a creepy diner in the middle of nowhere.""

I nodded, though my appetite had waned.",18,110
1pyyibi,,"I took a bite of my burger, the taste barely registering as I kept glancing around, my eyes flicking to the other patrons and the shadows in the corners of the room.",32,111
1pyyibi,,"""What's up, Jason?"" Leah asked through a mouthful of fries. ""You still on edge?""

I hesitated, then spoke. ""I can't shake it, Leah. When the lights went out...",28,112
1pyyibi,,"I swear, there was something behind me. I saw a face. It was inches away.""

Leah and Eric exchanged uneasy glances. Leah's smile faltered for a moment. ""Jason, seriously, enough.",30,113
1pyyibi,,"You're really starting to freak me out now.""

Eric set his coffee down, frowning slightly. ""Yeah, man. If this is a joke, it's not funny anymore. Just...",27,114
1pyyibi,,"stop, okay?""

I forced a smile, trying to brush off their reaction. ""I'm not joking, guys. It felt real.""

Leah shook her head, her expression torn between amusement and discomfort.",30,115
1pyyibi,,"""Okay, well, can we just drop it? Let's try to enjoy the food.""

Eric nodded, his gaze shifting to his pancakes. ""Yeah, let's just move on.",26,116
1pyyibi,,"This place is creepy enough without us making it worse.""

We ate quietly for a while, and surprisingly, the food was actually really good.",24,117
1pyyibi,,"Leah was halfway through her cheeseburger, her earlier unease replaced by her usual enthusiasm.",14,118
1pyyibi,,"""I have to admit, this is one of the best burgers I've had in a long time,"" she said, her voice cheerful again. Eric nodded, his pancakes already half gone.",30,119
1pyyibi,,"""Yeah, pretty solid""

I tried to relax, taking a bite of my burger. It was juicy and flavorful, and the fries were perfectly crispy.",24,120
1pyyibi,,"Leah wiped her hands on a napkin and then got up, glancing towards the back of the diner.",18,121
1pyyibi,,"""Alright, I hate to say it, but I need to break one of those scary rules,"" she said with a chuckle. ""Restroom time.",23,122
1pyyibi,,"Guess I'm going solo.""

Eric gave her a look, half-amused, half-concerned. ""You sure about that, Leah?""

She laughed, waving him off.",21,123
1pyyibi,,"""What, you think I'm going to get sucked into the haunted bathroom? I'll be fine.",15,124
1pyyibi,,"Just keep my milkshake safe.""

I watched as Leah made her way towards the restrooms, her confidence unwavering.",18,125
1pyyibi,,"But something in my gut twisted with unease, and I found myself unable to look away until she disappeared behind the restroom door.",23,126
1pyyibi,,"A few moments passed, and I tried to distract myself, picking at my fries. Eric was scrolling through his phone, oblivious to my anxiety.",24,127
1pyyibi,,"The diner felt quiet, the hum of the fluorescent lights overhead suddenly grating. Then, a scream pierced the air.",19,128
1pyyibi,,"My head snapped up, and I saw Eric's eyes widen as he turned towards the restrooms.",16,129
1pyyibi,,"Without thinking, I jumped up from the booth, my heart pounding as I rushed to the restroom door. I slammed it open, the door crashing against the wall.",28,130
1pyyibi,,"""Leah!"" I called out, my voice echoing in the small, tiled space. Leah was on the floor, her hands covering her face. She was trembling.",25,131
1pyyibi,,"I kneeled down next to her, my hands hovering just above her shoulders. ""Leah, it's okay. I'm here. What happened?""

She shook her head, her voice barely audible. ""There's...",29,132
1pyyibi,,"there's something in the stall. I saw it.""

I glanced towards the stall she was pointing at, my stomach churning.",20,133
1pyyibi,,"Carefully, I stood up and moved towards it, each step feeling heavier than the last. I reached out, hesitating for a moment before pushing the stall door open.",28,134
1pyyibi,,"It swung wide, revealing nothing but an empty stall. I turned back to Leah, her eyes wide with fear as she stared at me, trying to get a glimpse inside.",30,135
1pyyibi,,"""There's nothing here, Leah,"" I said gently, trying to keep my voice calm. ""It's empty.""

She shook her head again. ""No... no, I swear, Jason. There was something.",28,136
1pyyibi,,"It was there.""

I helped her to her feet, her hands still trembling as she clung to my arm. We walked back to the table, Leah leaning heavily against me.",30,137
1pyyibi,,"Eric stood up as we approached, his expression a mix of concern and confusion. ""What happened?"" he asked, his eyes darting between us.",23,138
1pyyibi,,"Leah sank into the booth, her face still pale. ""There was something in the stall, Eric. It... it was crawling towards me.""

Eric frowned, shaking his head. ""Leah, come on.",30,139
1pyyibi,,"Jason already freaked me out earlier. If you're trying to do the same thing...""

""No!"" Leah snapped, her voice trembling. ""This isn't a joke. There's something weird going on here.",30,140
1pyyibi,,"It's not just a marketing scheme.""

I nodded, my eyes meeting Eric's. ""She's right. Something's off about this place.",19,141
1pyyibi,,"We need to take this seriously.""

Eric hesitated, the doubt still evident on his face. ""Alright, fine. But...",18,142
1pyyibi,,"what exactly did you see, Leah?""

Leah took a deep breath, her eyes still wide with fear. ""It had four legs, like... like an animal, but no head or body.",30,143
1pyyibi,,Just legs. And it started moving towards me from the stall.,11,144
1pyyibi,,"I screamed, and then Jason came.""

Eric stared at her for a moment, his expression shifting from confusion to discomfort. He sighed, rubbing his temples. ""Okay, enough.",27,145
1pyyibi,,"This is getting way too weird, guys. I don't know if I believe it, but... it's really starting to freak me out.",22,146
1pyyibi,,"Can we just stop and try to chill for a bit? I need some air. I'm going outside."" Eric pushed himself up from the booth, grabbing his jacket.",28,147
1pyyibi,,"He shook his head, his expression a mix of skepticism and unease. ""I don't care about the rules or whatever is supposed to happen here.",25,148
1pyyibi,,"I just need a cigarette.""

""Eric, wait,"" I said, my voice urgent. ""You can't just go outside. The rules...""

""Forget the rules, Jason,"" Eric snapped, his frustration clear.",28,149
1pyyibi,,"""I'm not staying in here. It's too much."" He turned and headed towards the entrance, not waiting for Leah or me to respond.",23,150
1pyyibi,,"Eric reached the entrance door, pushing it open, but as he stepped halfway through, he froze... literally frozen mid-step, his body rigid between the diner and the outside.",28,151
1pyyibi,,"His hand still held the door, and his whole form seemed almost like a mannequin stuck in motion. ""Eric?"" Leah called out, her voice shaky.",25,152
1pyyibi,,"""What are you doing?""

I stood up, my heart pounding. ""Eric, come on, man. Stop messing around."" But there was no response, he was utterly still.",26,153
1pyyibi,,"Leah and I exchanged a nervous glance, both of us unsure of what to do. ""Is he... okay?"" Leah whispered, her eyes wide with fear.",25,154
1pyyibi,,"I shook my head, slowly stepping away from the booth. ""I... I don't know. He looks like he's stuck."" I moved closer, my eyes darting around the diner.",28,155
1pyyibi,,"The other patrons were no longer lost in their own worlds; instead, they were staring at Eric, their eyes unblinking, their heads fixed. ""Leah...",24,156
1pyyibi,,"they're all staring at him,"" I muttered. She turned her head, her breath catching in her throat as she noticed the other patrons' fixed gazes. I moved cautiously towards Eric.",30,157
1pyyibi,,"Just as I was within arm's reach of Eric, his body jerked violently, as if some unseen force had pushed him back.",22,158
1pyyibi,,"He flew into the diner, crashing onto his back and sliding several feet across the floor. ""Eric!"" I shouted, rushing to his side.",23,159
1pyyibi,,"He was gasping for breath, his face pale and his eyes wide with terror. I grabbed his arm, helping him sit up. ""What happened?",24,160
1pyyibi,,"Are you okay?""

Eric's eyes darted around wildly before locking onto mine. His voice was shaky. ""They're there... outside.",19,161
1pyyibi,,"They're there!""

I glanced towards the open door, but all I could see was darkness beyond.",16,162
1pyyibi,,"I helped Eric to his feet, and together we made our way back to the booth, Leah's face stricken with fear as she watched us approach.",26,163
1pyyibi,,"""What the hell happened?"" Leah asked, her voice trembling. Eric collapsed into the booth, his hands shaking. He took a moment to gather his breath, then began speaking.",28,164
1pyyibi,,"""I stepped outside, okay? I needed air. I moved around the side of the diner and lit a cigarette.""

Leah's eyes widened, and she interrupted. ""Eric, no, you didn't.",29,165
1pyyibi,,"You were just in the doorway. You were frozen there.""

We all exchanged glances, both terrified and confused. Eric shook his head, bewildered. ""No, I swear I stepped outside.",29,166
1pyyibi,,"I was out there. While I was having my cigarette, I started hearing something calling me from just around the diner.",21,167
1pyyibi,,"I went to the corner and peeked around it, but there was nothing.""

He paused, his eyes darting between us as he continued, his voice trembling.",26,168
1pyyibi,,"""I looked closer and started noticing movement in the dark. It was like... a face, detached from anything, just staring at me.",22,169
1pyyibi,,"Then the darkness seemed to get even thicker, like it swallowed everything else.""

Eric's voice dropped to a whisper.",19,170
1pyyibi,,"""I turned back towards the entrance of the diner, but it was dark there too... pitch black, like nothing was there. And then I heard it...",26,171
1pyyibi,,"this shushing noise, closing in on me. I can't explain it, but it was like something was surrounding me.",19,172
1pyyibi,,"I felt this sense of dread, like nothing I've ever felt before.",12,173
1pyyibi,,"Suddenly, I felt a hit to my chest, and the next thing I knew, I was on the diner's floor next to you, Jason.""

I nodded, my stomach churning with dread.",31,174
1pyyibi,,"Whatever was happening, it was real, and we were in the middle of it.",14,175
1pyyibi,,"The carefree vibe from earlier was gone, replaced by a deep, unsettling fear that none of us could shake.",19,176
1pyyibi,,"We sat there in silence for a moment, each of us processing what Eric had just said. I glanced around the diner, my eyes landing on the other patrons.",29,177
1pyyibi,,"The elderly couple in the corner booth had turned their heads slightly, their eyes now focused directly on us, their expressions blank. Leah shifted uncomfortably, her eyes following mine. ""Jason...",30,178
1pyyibi,,"do you see that?"" she whispered. ""They're... they're staring at us.""

I nodded, my pulse quickening. ""Yeah, I see it.""

Eric looked up, his face still pale.",27,179
1pyyibi,,"""What is wrong with these people?"" he muttered, his voice trembling. ""It's like they're not even real.""

The waitress, who had been standing behind the counter, suddenly moved.",28,180
1pyyibi,,"Her head turned towards us with an unnatural jerk, her eyes locking onto ours. Leah gasped, her hand flying to her mouth.",22,181
1pyyibi,,"""Did you see that?""

I nodded, my throat dry. ""Yeah. Something's really wrong here.""

Eric's eyes darted to the clock on the wall. It was just past 1 a.m.",29,182
1pyyibi,,"""We can't leave until 3 a.m. We literally can't leave.""

Leah's face paled as she stared at the clock. ""That's two more hours...",23,183
1pyyibi,,"what are we supposed to do?""

I took a deep breath. ""We stick to the rules. No more trying to test them.",22,184
1pyyibi,,"We just stay here, stay calm, and get through this."" My voice sounded more confident than I felt, but it was the only plan we had.",26,185
1pyyibi,,"Leah nodded, her eyes still wide with fear. ""Okay... okay. But we need to keep an eye on them.",19,186
1pyyibi,,"Something is seriously wrong here.""

Eric looked at the patrons again, his eyes narrowing. ""They’re watching us. All of them.",20,187
1pyyibi,,"And I don’t think it’s just for show.""

Whatever was happening here, we were trapped, and we needed to be careful.",21,188
1pyyibi,,"Feeling the oppressive eeriness of the situation, we all got up for a moment, as if movement might help break the tension.",22,189
1pyyibi,,"I started pacing around our booth, back and forth, my thoughts racing as I tried to make sense of everything.",20,190
1pyyibi,,"Leah and Eric stood close by, their eyes darting anxiously around the diner. As I walked, my back turned to them, I suddenly felt a light tap on my shoulder.",30,191
1pyyibi,,"My first thought was that it was Eric. I spun around, but when I looked towards where they had been standing, I froze.",23,192
1pyyibi,,"Two strangers were standing there, their faces blurry and their eyes locked directly on me.",15,193
1pyyibi,,My stomach dropped as I remembered Rule 7: Never turn around if someone taps you on the shoulder. It was too late now. The strangers stared at me.,28,194
1pyyibi,,"Panic surged through me, my chest tightening as I struggled to understand what was happening.",15,195
1pyyibi,,"Their gaze felt invasive, as if they were looking straight through me, seeing something I couldn’t comprehend. ""Leah?",18,196
1pyyibi,,"Eric?"" I called out again, my voice cracking, but there was no response... just the heavy silence of the diner.",20,197
1pyyibi,,"The strangers took a step closer, their movements jerky, almost puppet-like. My pulse pounded in my ears.",17,198
1pyyibi,,"My eyes darted around the diner, catching sight of the other patrons, all of them were now staring at me, their heads turned in unison, their eyes vacant.",28,199
1pyyibi,,"I freaked out. Panic clawed at my throat, and without thinking, I turned and started running through the diner.",19,200
1pyyibi,,"I reached the other part of the counter, my eyes wild as I scanned the room, not knowing where to run anymore.",22,201
1pyyibi,,"The strangers were closing in, their steps slow but relentless, like they knew I had nowhere to go.",18,202
1pyyibi,,"My back hit the corner of the diner, and I slid down until I was crouched on the floor, my arms wrapped around my knees in some sort of a fetal position.",32,203
1pyyibi,,"My entire body trembled with terror as the lights began to flicker once more. Each flash of light revealed the strangers inching closer, their faces still blurry.",27,204
1pyyibi,,"Suddenly, cold hands wrapped around my forearms, gripping me tightly. I gasped as a sharp, searing pain shot through my skin, like their fingers were burning into me.",28,205
1pyyibi,,"I tried to pull away, but their grip was ironclad, lifting me slightly off the ground.",16,206
1pyyibi,,"My vision blurred, the room spinning as the pain became unbearable, radiating up my arms like fire. The lights flickered again, then returned to full brightness.",26,207
1pyyibi,,"I still felt hands on my forearms, trying to lift me up. Leah's voice broke through the haze of fear. ""Jason! Jason, it's okay. We're here.",26,208
1pyyibi,,"Calm down.""

I looked up, my friends' worried faces coming into focus. But the pain in my forearms was still there, a dull throb.",24,209
1pyyibi,,"I glanced down and saw deep red marks, finger-shaped bruises imprinted on my skin. ""It's okay,"" Leah repeated, her voice softer now. ""You're okay.",24,210
1pyyibi,,"We're here."" 

I took a deep breath. ""They were... they were coming for me,"" I whispered. Leah shook her head slightly, her expression growing more serious.",26,211
1pyyibi,,"""Jason, there was no one there. It was just us. You... you looked like you were in some kind of trance.",21,212
1pyyibi,,"Then you suddenly started running, like you were terrified of something.""

Eric nodded, his eyes meeting mine with concern.",19,213
1pyyibi,,"""We tried to stop you, but you wouldn't listen.""

Leah's grip on my shoulders tightened. ""But you're okay now.",19,214
1pyyibi,,"We're going to stick together, alright?""

We slowly made our way back to the booth, settling in with a shared sense of unease.",23,215
1pyyibi,,"Just as I started to catch my breath, a new sound broke the silence... a muffled noise coming from the kitchen.",21,216
1pyyibi,,"It was faint at first, like someone crying, the sound almost getting lost in the hum of the diner lights. Then it grew louder, more distinct...",26,217
1pyyibi,,"someone was crying for help. Leah tensed beside me. ""Don't listen to it,"" she whispered, her voice trembling. ""It's trying to trick us.",23,218
1pyyibi,,"We stick to the rules.""

Eric nodded, his eyes fixed on the kitchen door, which was barely visible from our booth. ""Yeah, we can't let it get to us.",29,219
1pyyibi,,"It's what it wants.""

The cries grew louder, more desperate, but we held on, refusing to move. The kitchen door remained slightly ajar, and shadows seemed to dance behind it.",30,220
1pyyibi,,"The voice called out again, pleading, but we all sat still, determined not to be fooled. Suddenly, I blinked, and everything changed.",22,221
1pyyibi,,"The booth was empty, Leah and Eric were gone.",9,222
1pyyibi,,"My heart dropped as I looked around, the diner now barely lit, with only a few flickering lights casting shadows across the room.",23,223
1pyyibi,,"The cries for help were still coming from the kitchen, but now the voice was unmistakably Leah's. ""Jason! Please, help me!"" Leah's voice echoed, filled with fear and pain.",29,224
1pyyibi,,"The diner was empty, every booth vacant, the air heavy and cold. The lights flickered again, making it even harder to see. ""Leah?"" I called out, my voice cracking.",29,225
1pyyibi,,"There was no response, only her screams growing louder, more frantic. ""Please, Jason! I'm in here!""

I took a step towards the kitchen, my mind racing.",26,226
1pyyibi,,"The rules said to avoid the kitchen at all costs, even if someone called for help. But Leah's voice was so real, so desperate.",24,227
1pyyibi,,"Each plea tore at me, making it harder to think straight. I approached the kitchen door, the cries now almost deafening.",21,228
1pyyibi,,"The door was slightly open, revealing nothing but pitch darkness beyond. My hand hovered near the door handle. ""It's a trick,"" I whispered to myself.",25,229
1pyyibi,,"""It's trying to trick me."" Leah's screams continued, pleading, sobbing. My entire body was shaking, my instincts screaming at me to do something. But I didn't go inside. I couldn't.",30,230
1pyyibi,,"The rules were clear, and deep down, I knew this wasn't Leah... it couldn't be. I stepped back, forcing myself to look away from the darkness of the kitchen.",29,231
1pyyibi,,"""I'm not falling for it,"" I muttered. The cries suddenly stopped, leaving an eerie silence that filled the diner.",19,232
1pyyibi,,"I turned away from the kitchen and looked around the empty diner, hoping, praying to see Leah and Eric again.",20,233
1pyyibi,,"Suddenly, I heard a faint shuffle coming from the far end of the diner, near the entrance. I turned to look.",21,234
1pyyibi,,"In the dim light, I saw a silhouette standing by the door. Relief washed over me as I recognized Leah's familiar frame.",22,235
1pyyibi,,"""Leah!"" I called out, my voice echoing in the stillness. She didn't respond, but she moved towards me, her steps slow and hesitant.",23,236
1pyyibi,,"As she got closer, I noticed something was off. Her movements were jerky, unnatural, like she was struggling against something. ""Leah, are you okay?"" I asked, my voice trembling.",29,237
1pyyibi,,"She stopped a few feet away from me, her head tilted slightly as if she was listening to something I couldn't hear. ""Jason..."" she finally spoke. ""You...",27,238
1pyyibi,,"you have to come with me.""

My stomach twisted with unease. ""Where's Eric?"" I asked, taking a cautious step back. ""He's... waiting,"" she said, her voice flat, devoid of emotion.",30,239
1pyyibi,,"She reached out her hand towards me, her fingers trembling. ""Please, Jason. You have to come.""

I shook my head, my instincts screaming that something wasn't right. ""No...",28,240
1pyyibi,,"Leah, we need to stay here. We need to stick to the rules.""

Her eyes locked onto mine, and for a moment, I saw something flicker in them... fear, desperation.",30,241
1pyyibi,,"She opened her mouth to say something, but no words came out.",12,242
1pyyibi,,"Instead, her expression twisted into one of panic, her eyes widening as if she was trying to warn me. Suddenly, the lights flickered again, plunging the diner into darkness.",29,243
1pyyibi,,"When the lights returned, Leah was gone. Panic surged through me. I spun around, searching the empty diner. ""Leah? Eric?"" I called out. There was no response.",27,244
1pyyibi,,"I felt a presence... something watching me. My eyes were drawn back to the kitchen door, still slightly ajar, the darkness beyond it seeming even deeper now.",27,245
1pyyibi,,"Suddenly, I heard a different sound... footsteps, coming from behind me. I turned slowly, my entire body tense, and saw a figure emerging from the shadows. It was Eric.",29,246
1pyyibi,,"He looked disheveled, his face pale, his eyes wide with fear. ""Jason,"" he whispered. ""We need to get out of here.",21,247
1pyyibi,,"Now.""

I hesitated, the confusion and fear swirling inside me. ""But... the rules. We can't leave until 3 a.m.""

Eric shook his head, his eyes darting around the diner.",29,248
1pyyibi,,"""The rules don't matter anymore. It's changing them. It's trying to keep us here."" He grabbed my arm, his grip tight, almost painful. ""We have to go.",27,249
1pyyibi,,"Before it’s too late.""

The lights flickered again, and for a brief moment, I saw shadows moving across the walls, shifting and writhing as if they were alive.",28,250
1pyyibi,,"The diner felt like it was closing in on us, the air growing colder, the shadows creeping closer. Eric pulled me towards the entrance, his voice urgent. ""Come on, Jason.",30,251
1pyyibi,,"We have to leave. Now.""

I glanced back at the kitchen door, the darkness beyond it seeming to pulse. Suddenly, everything shifted.",22,252
1pyyibi,,"In an instant, I was back at the booth.",9,253
1pyyibi,,"Leah and Eric were sitting across from me, and Leah was waving her hand in front of my face, trying to catch my attention.",24,254
1pyyibi,,"""Jason, you drifted off for a few minutes. Are you okay?"" Eric asked, his voice filled with concern. I blinked, disoriented, my heart still pounding in my chest. ""I...",29,255
1pyyibi,,"I don't know. It felt so real,"" I said, my voice shaky. ""I was alone in the diner, and there was Leah... calling from the kitchen.",26,256
1pyyibi,,"It was like I was caught in some sort of illusion."" I took a deep breath, trying to steady myself. ""This is crazy.""

Leah exchanged a worried glance with Eric.",30,257
1pyyibi,,"""Jason, you were just sitting here, staring at the kitchen door.""

Eric nodded, his eyes wide. ""We tried to snap you out of it, but you were just...",28,258
1pyyibi,,"gone.""

I rubbed my temples, trying to make sense of it all.",12,259
1pyyibi,,"The fear still clung to me, the memory of the empty diner and Leah's desperate cries vivid in my mind. ""I don't know what's real anymore,"" I muttered.",28,260
1pyyibi,,"""We need to be careful. Whatever this place is, it's messing with our heads.""

Leah reached across the table, taking my hand. ""We're in this together, Jason.",27,261
1pyyibi,,"We just have to stay focused and remember the rules. We can't let it break us.""

Eric nodded in agreement, his expression grim.",23,262
1pyyibi,,"""It's trying to divide us, make us lose our grip. We just have to hold on a little longer. It's almost 3 a.m.",23,263
1pyyibi,,"As the minutes dragged on, our anxiety grew. The clock on the wall ticked closer to 3 a.m., each second feeling like an eternity.",24,264
1pyyibi,,"Leah and Eric exchanged nervous glances, and I could feel the tension between us, the weight of the unknown pressing down on us.",23,265
1pyyibi,,"Finally, the clock struck 3 a.m., the sound echoing through the empty diner. We all exhaled, a mixture of fear and relief washing over us.",25,266
1pyyibi,,"Leah nodded towards the front door. ""It's time. Let's get out of here.""

We stood up together, making our way towards the entrance.",23,267
1pyyibi,,"I pulled the door open, expecting to see the dark road outside, our way out of this nightmare. Instead, all we saw was darkness... a void, empty and endless. ""What...",30,268
1pyyibi,,"what is this?"" Eric muttered. The doorway led to nothing, just an infinite darkness that seemed to swallow the light from the diner. Suddenly, a noise behind us...",28,269
1pyyibi,,"the strange patrons in the booths, the other patrons who had been eerily silent all night, began to move.",19,270
1pyyibi,,"They stood up, one by one, their movements slow, their eyes fixed on us. Leah took a step back, her breath catching in her throat.",25,271
1pyyibi,,"""They're coming...""

The patrons approached us, their faces expressionless, their footsteps echoing in the stillness of the diner.",18,272
1pyyibi,,"I felt a surge of panic, my instincts screaming at me to run, but there was nowhere to go... the door led to nothing, and the patrons were closing in.",30,273
1pyyibi,,"But then, the patrons stopped. In unison, they spoke, their voices overlapping in a haunting harmony.",16,274
1pyyibi,,"""The only way to escape is to follow us.""

Leah, Eric, and I exchanged wary glances, uncertainty etched across our faces.",21,275
1pyyibi,,"The patrons began to move again, gesturing for us to follow them towards the back of the diner. Hesitant but desperate, we had no choice. We followed them...",28,276
1pyyibi,,"They led us to a part of the diner we hadn't noticed before... a door at the back, hidden in the shadows, one that hadn't been there earlier.",28,277
1pyyibi,,"The patrons gestured towards it. ""Through here,"" they said in unison. ""It's the only way.""

Together, we pushed open the door, a cold breeze hitting us as it swung open.",30,278
1pyyibi,,"We stepped through, and suddenly, we were outside. The cold night air was like a wave of relief, the oppressive feeling from the diner finally lifting.",26,279
1pyyibi,,"We turned around, but the door and the diner... were gone. All that remained was an empty road, stretching out into the darkness.",23,280
1pyyibi,,"Leah let out a shaky breath, her eyes wide with disbelief. ""We made it... we're out.""

Eric nodded, his face a mix of exhaustion and relief.",26,281
1pyyibi,,"""I don't know how, but we did it.""

I looked around, the memory of the diner's horrors still vivid in my mind.",22,282
1pyyibi,,"We were free, but I knew that night would haunt us forever. ""Come on,"" I said.",16,283
1pyyibi,,"""Let's get as far away from here as we can.""

Weeks after escaping, I sat in my dorm, browsing online forums late at night.",24,284
1pyyibi,,"I came across a post titled ""The Vanishing Diner - Have You Seen It?"". I read accounts eerily similar to our own. The Last Stop Café...",26,285
1pyyibi,,people claimed it had been appearing and disappearing across different states for decades.,13,286
1pyyibi,,"The descriptions were identical: detours that shouldn't exist, strange rules in the menus, and patrons with blurry faces.",18,287
1pyyibi,,"As I read further, I stumbled upon posts from people searching desperately for loved ones who vanished after visiting diners just like this one. The eerie part?",27,288
1pyyibi,,The missing individuals matched the descriptions of people we saw that night.,12,289
1pyyibi,,"A chill ran through me as I realized we might have been witnessing people who were already lost to the diner, trapped in some twisted limbo.",26,290
1pyyibi,,"The realization left me cold, we might have become just another entry in those threads.",15,291
1pyyibi,,"So, if you ever find yourself on a detour and see The Last Stop Café, just keep [driving.](",18,292

1pyq30c,,"Closed on Mondays, open Tuesday-Saturday, from 8-5. Despite hitting every light on my way there, the drive was short.",19,6
1pyq30c,,"With my camera bag riding shotgun, I sped down the highway almost missing the dark brown sign saying “Belkin Hollow Nature Preserve” and had to make a sharp turn to enter.",31,7
1pyq30c,,"Past the rusted iron gates was a gravel road with a large white sign in red letters that said the following: 

 

**Rules of the Nature Preserve:** 

Stay on the trails at all times.",33,8

1pyq30c,,The Information Center was devoid of any life at all and the more I looked around the more I began to realize how bare bones the preserve seemed to run.,30,12
1pyq30c,,"It seemed as though no one worked there; buildings were locked, there was no sign of any sort of human life.",21,13
1pyq30c,,"I picked a trail and began to walk, feeling the still sleeping earth crunching beneath my feet.",17,14
1pyq30c,,"I always liked the ‘in-between’ parts of the season; late March going into April was always particularly nice as it was still cool outside, everything seems dormant, but there were little signs of spring-daffodils starting to sprout, little pieces of green here and there.",44,15
1pyq30c,,"It was peaceful, and I liked it that way. I came across a weathered sign that through chipped paint read “Swamp Trail” and off I went.",26,16

TROLL MAN

Arthur had been online since the early days of the internet. He loved medieval fantasy, trolls, and Shrek—obsessively.",26,5
1pym9dd,,"He drew comics, wrote rambling posts, and filmed videos in his bedroom that he called the “Round Table Tavern,” even though it was just his room in his mother’s house, filled wall to wall with memorabilia.",36,6
1pym9dd,,People messed with him. At first lightly. Then constantly. Then cruelly. It snowballed. More people joined in. It became entertainment. Then he disappeared.,23,7

1pym9dd,,"“No need to worry about me,” he says, glancing repeatedly to his left. “These trolls will never take my spirit.”

He laughs. His movements are erratic.",26,9
1pym9dd,,"“There is no way they could take me. I am too powerful. They are all too stupid—”

The camera suddenly tips sideways. You can hear movement off-screen. A struggle.",29,10
1pym9dd,,Three heavy thumps. Then a scream. The tape cuts to static. The police told me later that this was the first tape chronologically. I didn’t tell them everything.,28,11

Two weeks later

Arthur’s mother told police she hadn’t seen him in six months. He used to call her regularly. Then he just… stopped.",25,12
1pym9dd,,"A few weeks after that, she received a VHS tape labeled THE BRIDGE. It shows a dark, abandoned bridge at night. You can barely make it out.",27,13
1pym9dd,,"A voice off camera recites riddles—nonsensical, mocking, childish. That’s when she filed a missing persons report. The police searched briefly. Arthur had a history of wandering, filming himself, posting videos.",30,14
1pym9dd,,They assumed he’d come back. He never did. I went to his town in Illinois. People remembered him as quiet. Reclusive. He wandered streets alone.,25,15
1pym9dd,,"Sometimes he’d visit Barnes & Noble and buy fantasy novels. Near the end, people said he’d begun proclaiming himself the reincarnation of King Arthur in public.",26,16
1pym9dd,,"He was eventually banned from the bookstore. After that, he was mostly regarded as a nuisance. The police eventually allowed me to view what they believed was the second tape.",30,17
1pym9dd,,Arthur sits at a wooden table in front of a fake fantasy tavern background.,14,18
1pym9dd,,"He wears a Viking helmet, a fake beard, and has a visible black eye and bruising on his neck. He holds a beer pitcher and a turkey leg.",28,19
1pym9dd,,"“I am the mighty King Arthur,” he says. “This mead and meat will keep me strong for my fair maidens.”

A voice behind the camera speaks. “What maidens?”

Arthur hesitates.",30,20
1pym9dd,,"“Well… my dear Guinevere—”

A massive shadow looms over him. The tape cuts out. ⸻

After the purge

After the tapes were leaked, the community erased everything. Forums wiped.",29,21
1pym9dd,,Wikis deleted. Archives scrubbed. I helped enforce it. I threatened people. Blackmailed some. I hate myself for that. But something worse started happening.,23,22
1pym9dd,,"Anyone who tried to rebuild—any post, site, or even hashtag mentioning Arthur—received a package.",14,23
1pym9dd,,One woman opened her door to find a medieval sword hanging from a string above her porch. Another received a mace. One man received a bundle of straw.,28,24
1pym9dd,,"After that, their lives collapsed. The man with the straw—his house burned down. He and his family died inside. Others vanished. Their posts were deleted. Accounts gone. No contact.",29,25
1pym9dd,,Only rumors remained. A woman crushed her family with rocks. Another cut the string and let the sword fall into her body. No proof. Just stories. Just like Arthur.,29,26

The third tape

FOR THE FIRST OF MY KIND

It shows a figure—what the police called “the Troll Man”—chasing Arthur through the woods with a cattle prod.",30,29
1pym9dd,,Arthur screams. The figure tackles him. Electricity crackles. The only sounds are Arthur’s screams and muffled laughter. I knew who it was meant for. The first major troll.,28,30

I did what I could, sharing what little water I had left with her.",17,6

1pyd4ym,,"All she wanted was mercy, and I couldn’t give it to her. Watching her slip away, unable to do anything, was tearing me apart inside.",25,8

1pyd4ym,,"I knew I couldn’t free her from this hell, and it broke me.",13,12
1pyd4ym,,"My mind was fading, circling the edge of sanity, when it was suddenly interrupted by a presence slowly emerging from the shadows.",22,13
1pyd4ym,,"It was subtle at first, like a ghost wandering the corridors. Then I heard them. Soft, uneven footsteps dragging across the floorboards.",22,14
1pyd4ym,,"They were familiar, almost comforting, ripping me out of my spiraling torment. The door creaked open slowly, and Mara stepped inside gently, still holding the same emotionless expression.",28,15

I couldn’t even respond. My body was sore and weak, and for a moment, I didn’t know if I could even speak anymore.",27,18

1pyd4ym,,"The air was musty, thick with decay, as if the building were rotting beneath me as I walked, yet something about the place still felt very much alive, as if it were watching me, aware of my presence.",38,27
1pyd4ym,,"I glanced ahead, where Mara was already several steps in front of me, her movements eerily calm. She didn’t seem affected by the atmosphere at all.",26,28

1pyd4ym,,"Turning a corner, a door emerged down the hall.",9,32
1pyd4ym,,"At first, it seemed like a silent invitation, but the closer we got, the more it felt like a trap, looming ahead like a hungry beast.",26,33
1pyd4ym,,"Its battered frame gleamed unnaturally in the hallway light, as though it were alive, pulsing with an eager, baleful energy.",20,34

That fact alone sat like a stone in my stomach. I knew hesitation wasn’t an option. Not with him. Not here.",24,37
1pyd4ym,,"We stopped in front of the door so that Mara could find the key. It didn’t look like the others. It was painted matte black, unmarked like the rest.",29,38
1pyd4ym,,"There was no handle, no keyhole, nothing that suggested a way in. She reached into her pocket, pulling out a small, flat metal disc.",24,39
1pyd4ym,,"The disc was unremarkable at first glance. It looked like just a dull, worn piece of metal, but she held it with a kind of reverence.",26,40

1pyd4ym,,"Nothing happened at first, the air turning stale between us, as though the door itself was taking its time to respond.",21,42
1pyd4ym,,"Then, with a metallic clank, followed by the faint sound of something sliding, the door cracked open slightly.",18,43
1pyd4ym,,"Mara applied more pressure to the disc, and with another faint mechanical whine, the door gave way. It didn’t open like a normal door.",24,44
1pyd4ym,,"Instead, it shifted inward, like a bank vault, hiding things not meant to be seen. The door swung open smoothly, revealing an opening.",23,45
1pyd4ym,,"The darkness swallowed everything, making it hard to see where the space began and ended. I couldn’t see more than a foot inside.",23,46
1pyd4ym,,"The air felt cold and stagnant, heavy with the scent of bleach and old iron, becoming sharp and sterile, like an old hospital room, the further we went inside.",29,47

As my eyes adjusted, I could see further into the space. It was like nothing I’d ever seen.",26,49
1pyd4ym,,"The walls were crooked, twisted at strange angles, as if the architecture itself were trying to contain and confuse me.",20,50
1pyd4ym,,"A low hum vibrated through the stone floor, through my bones and into my skull, burrowing deeper with every breath I took. It felt different. It felt alive.",28,51
1pyd4ym,,"My heart raced as my hair stood on end. I couldn’t focus. I wanted to look away, to scream, but my brain refused to cooperate.",25,52
1pyd4ym,,"Every instinct gnawed at me to run, but I couldn’t move. “This is…” I began, Mara cutting me off. “Shh. Don’t talk.",22,53
1pyd4ym,,"Listen.”

The hum grew louder, twisting into something different, something worse.",11,54
1pyd4ym,,"Whispers filled the room, voices barely audible in the darkness, reverberating across the walls and curling around me like smoke. They slithered into my mind, burrowing into my consciousness.",29,55
1pyd4ym,,"“You hear them?” Mara whispered, voice thin. “He feeds on them.",11,56
1pyd4ym,,"He feeds on their fear and obedience, using them when he wants, and then he leaves them here.”

She reached over and flicked a switch on the wall.",28,57
1pyd4ym,,"Suddenly, hundreds of fluorescent lights buzzed above my head, flickering alive. The room stretched out before me, much further than I thought, now completely bathed in light.",27,58

1pyd4ym,,"I took a step forward. My body carried me closer unconsciously, drawn to them before my mind could catch up.",20,69
1pyd4ym,,"Their eyes flicked toward me, hollow and pleading, yet no words came. Their mouths were silent, but their eyes begged for something… anything to end their suffering misery.",28,70

1pyd4ym,,"He had stripped away the rest, leaving behind nothing but a vessel, a symbol of his twisted control and domination. Mara stepped closer, brushing her hand against my arm.",29,72
1pyd4ym,,"I felt the warmth of her touch, but it did nothing to calm the raw panic rising in me. “These are the ones who’ve been... chosen,” she murmured.",28,73
1pyd4ym,,“They all believed they could resist. They all believed they could survive. But they were wrong. He breaks you in ways he knows you can’t fight. They’re his now.,29,74

1pyd4ym,,"Seeing all those innocent lives bound and trapped, hearing their whispers, feeling their fear… it was all starting to get to me.",22,78
1pyd4ym,,"I fell to my knees and began to sob, letting all of the built-up anger and pain flow out of me. I had stayed strong for so long, until now.",30,79
1pyd4ym,,"I had never felt weaker, more insignificant, more guilty. “Focus, Emily,” Mara said sharply, pulling me back. “This is where the real test begins. Do you understand?",27,80

I nodded, my throat tight, the words stuck somewhere deep inside me.",23,81

1pyd4ym,,"A blinding rage rose from deep within me, burning into my chest and bringing with it strength and defiance. The sorrow didn’t disappear.",23,84
1pyd4ym,,"It was hardened, sharpened into a weapon I could use. Slowly, I pushed myself upright, rising from the floor as the anger filled my limbs with newfound strength.",28,85

I didn’t want to follow.",26,87

1pyabas,,I lived there with my mom in this cabin she claims to have built with her own two hands.,19,1
1pyabas,,"I believed her for a while, though now, I’m fairly certain she just found an abandoned cabin and fixed it up as best she could.",25,2
1pyabas,,"It was so cold in the winter, and the small fires we managed to produce in the fireplace did little to warm the area.",24,3
1pyabas,,"Most winter nights were spent with us cuddled under the same blanket. During the summers, the cabin was so humid that you could see the wood sweating.",27,4
1pyabas,,"Often, we’d opt for sleeping outside on summer nights, despite the clouds of mosquitoes that the makeshift netting my mom made from old fabric did little to quell.",28,5
1pyabas,,"The multitude of bug bites was preferable to waking up dehydrated from sweat, though.",14,6
1pyabas,,"Our days back then were mostly spent with my mom hunting for small animals to cook and eat, while I gathered firewood and picked berries.",25,7
1pyabas,,"On rare occasions, we would take breaks and spend the day singing songs or reading from the handful of books she had.",22,8
1pyabas,,"However, we needed to survive, and that meant working hard to ensure we had food and fresh water. My mask made foraging more difficult than it should’ve been.",28,9
1pyabas,,"I constantly had to pull at the white cotton sheet to fit the eyeholes over my eyes, and it would often become drenched in sweat within an hour.",28,10
1pyabas,,The only time I ever took off my mask was when my mom bathed me.,15,11
1pyabas,,"I would often try to catch my reflection in the water, but it was never clean enough. I wondered if she'd ever seen my face.",25,12
1pyabas,,"She would've had to have seen it the day I was born, right? I learned early on not to ask my mom questions that involved the masks or my face.",30,13
1pyabas,,"The only answer I ever received was that if I took off my mask in front of someone, something bad would happen.",22,14
1pyabas,,"If I pushed any further, she would say, “I’m your mother, and you should trust that I know what’s best.” And I did, for a long time.",27,15
1pyabas,,"My mother was my whole world, and I loved her as much as a boy could.",16,16
1pyabas,,"We spent most of our time together, and I have mostly happy memories of her.",15,17
1pyabas,,"Of course, there are bad memories sprinkled in there, with some being downright horrible…

I recall once when I was somewhere between 4 and 6; I was playing outside in our garden.",32,18
1pyabas,,"Mom was on the other side of the yard doing laundry while I hopped through the soft dirt, stepping on any pests I saw.",24,19
1pyabas,,"Looking at their guts on the underside of my shoes every time I stepped on one filled me with a sense of satisfaction, knowing I was aiding in our survival in a small way.",34,20
1pyabas,,I’d made my way to the end of the garden when I noticed the rabbit cage. Mom had kept several she’d caught in traps to breed for meat.,28,21
1pyabas,,"She told me not to get attached to any of them as we’d be eating them all at some point, but of course, I’d given them all names and loved sticking my fingers in the cage to feel their soft fur.",41,22
1pyabas,,"One of the females, whom I’d named Daisy after a character in one of my mom’s books, was staring at me.",21,23
1pyabas,,She chewed on whatever vegetation she had in her mouth as I approached.,13,24
1pyabas,,"She didn’t scurry or hide like all the others in the cage, instead continuing to look me in the eyes.",20,25
1pyabas,,The curious way she watched me made me smile underneath my mask.,12,26
1pyabas,,We looked at each other for a while before I got the sudden urge to untie the twine from my neck.,21,27
1pyabas,,"It fell to the ground, and I slowly pulled the mask away from my face. Daisy continued staring as I moved my bare face closer to hers.",27,28
1pyabas,,"A warmth fell over me as she stared. The feeling of having someone, even a small-minded creature like a rabbit, see my real face was almost euphoric.",27,29
1pyabas,,The rabbit didn’t cower as I thought it might upon seeing my face.,13,30
1pyabas,,"The way my mom pushed to keep my face hidden made me think there was something horrible about it. But if there was, Daisy didn’t care.",26,31
1pyabas,,She didn’t look at me any differently than she might my mom or one of the other rabbits. It made me smile brighter than I ever had.,27,32
1pyabas,,"“Nestor,” called my mom from around the corner. I struggled to grab my mask from the ground and throw it back on my face, but it was too late.",29,33
1pyabas,,Mom grabbed me by the shoulder while staring at the sky and smacked the back of my head hard enough to make my vision blur.,25,34
1pyabas,,“Put your mask back on right now!” she cried.,9,35
1pyabas,,"I did as she asked, and she pulled me away from the scene, leaving Daisy still staring in the spot where I’d been standing.",24,36
1pyabas,,"We had Daisy for dinner that night. Mom didn’t have to tell me, as I’d seen her take Daisy from the cage from my bedroom window.",26,37
1pyabas,,"I listened to her frantic squeaks before Mom likely broke her neck, as was her common method for killing our dinner.",21,38
1pyabas,,"Daisy lay in a charred pile in the center of the table that night. Mom pulled off one of her legs and threw it on my plate. “Eat,” she said.",30,39
1pyabas,,Tears soaked the inside of my mask as I pulled down the mouth hole a bit so it sat as close to my mouth as I could get it.,29,40
1pyabas,,I picked up Daisy’s leg and brought it to my lips. “Eat!” she yelled. I took a bite of the unseasoned meat and tore it away from the bone.,29,41
1pyabas,,"I closed my eyes while chewing and swallowed. Mom nodded and began eating some breast meat, satisfied.",17,42
1pyabas,,"“Do you realize what could have happened if I accidentally saw you without your mask?” she asked. “No. You won’t tell me,” I returned defiantly.",25,43
1pyabas,,Mom paused as if trying to gather her thoughts.,9,44
1pyabas,,"She sighed, then gave her constant answer of, “Something bad.”

I felt my mask, poking at the small holes that’d begun to form along the neck.",26,45
1pyabas,,I’d have a new one the first time I met another person.,12,46
1pyabas,,"\---

Like the last mask, this one was made from cloth, but it was a bit thicker, as if it were made from a thick jacket.",26,47
1pyabas,,"Despite this, it breathed better, making the summer trips collecting berries a bit more bearable.",15,48
1pyabas,,"I was 8 or 9 years old during one of these trips, and several yards from us, I spotted a bush covered in red berries.",25,49
1pyabas,,"We avoided the green berries, and most of what we ate was dark purple and bitter. However, the red ones had a sweet, tangy flavor that I still crave sometimes.",30,50
1pyabas,,"I rushed over to them, carrying my basket in tow.",10,51
1pyabas,,"I hadn’t gotten used to my long legs and arms from my growth spurt earlier that year, so I awkwardly flopped around before reaching the bush.",26,52
1pyabas,,"As I approached, it moved a little, like something was inside. I moved closer, assuming it was a squirrel or some other small critter I could easily fight off.",29,53
1pyabas,,A mop of blonde hair poked out from the side of the bush. I rounded it to see the back of a kid.,23,54
1pyabas,,"They turned as soon as I approached, and I was met with a blue-eyed, skinny blonde girl. She was around my age.",22,55
1pyabas,,"Her hair fell past her shoulders, and it was full of leaves.",12,56
1pyabas,,"The dirt stains on her clothes and scratches across her bare legs told me she's been in the woods for a while. “Hi,” the girl said with a bright smile.",30,57
1pyabas,,I backed away a bit. “Why are you wearing a mask? Are you a superhero?” She asked with a mocking laugh. “Superhero?” I asked.,24,58
1pyabas,,"“Yeah,” she returned before reaching into her back pocket and pulling out a rolled comic book. She handed it to me, and I saw “Spider-Man” written on the front.",29,59
1pyabas,,"It was the first time I'd ever seen anyone else in a mask, though his was a lot cooler than mine.",21,60
1pyabas,,"“You should wear one like him instead,” the girl said. The sound of leaves crunching sounded behind me, and I saw my mom approach with her bow and arrow.",29,61
1pyabas,,"Her eyes widened when she noticed the girl. “Hello,” the girl said. I watched my mom's hands shake as she held the bow and arrow tightly against her side.",29,62
1pyabas,,"Another sound came from behind the girl, and Mom quickly lifted the weapon. It was a man with a large brown beard.",22,63
1pyabas,,"He spotted my mom instantly and threw his hands up in submission while slowly moving in front of the girl. “Who are you?” Mom asked. “Uh, hello,” he said.",29,64
1pyabas,,"“I'm Monty, and this is my daughter, Jamie. We're camping nearby. Sorry, I didn't know we were on someone's property.”

Mom refused to lower the bow and arrow.",28,65
1pyabas,,"“You need to leave.”

“Is this your property?” The man asked. Mom bit her lip, and her arms started to shake. “Yes,” she said.",24,66
1pyabas,,"“Would the Parks Office confirm that if I called?” He asked. Mom lowered the bow a little. “Jamie, why don’t you go find some firewood?” he said.",27,67
1pyabas,,"“But, dad-”

“Go!”

Jamie pursed her lips and glanced at me before stomping away.",14,68
1pyabas,,"“Look, if you're this deep in the woods, I assume you're hiding from something just like we are.” He said to my mom before looking at me and raising his eyebrow.",31,69
1pyabas,,"“We don’t want any trouble, and I don’t care what you’re doing out here, honestly.”

“...see that tree,” Mom said, pointing to the tallest one in the area.",28,70
1pyabas,,"“Don't cross it again. You or your girl.”

“You got it,” Monty said with a smile, and with that, my Mom lowered her weapon.",24,71
1pyabas,,"“I was just bluffing, by the way. I ain't got a phone. Too easy to track.”

Mom grabbed me by the arm and pulled as we started walking back home.",30,72
1pyabas,,"“If you ever want to trade some of your kills, let me know,” he said. “We've got plenty of beans and rice.”

Mom ignored him.",25,73
1pyabas,,"“We're in the RV down the trail about two miles,” he called. I looked back and saw the girl waving. I didn't stop looking until they disappeared in the distance.",30,74
1pyabas,,"\---

I helped Mom gut the rabbit she’d caught for dinner, holding the bag for the innards as she ripped them out of the small creature.",26,75
1pyabas,,"She hadn’t said much since we met the father and daughter in the woods, and I couldn’t tell if she was concerned or mad.",24,76
1pyabas,,"I knew I should avoid bringing it up, but couldn’t help myself.",12,77
1pyabas,,"“I thought you said there was no one else in these woods,” I said as she placed a handful of visera into the bag. “There weren’t,” she said.",28,78
1pyabas,,"“And I need to figure out a way to get ridda them.”

“Why?” I asked. “They didn’t seem dangerous.”

She paused.",21,79
1pyabas,,"“Everyone is dangerous, Nestor.”

I dropped my head and stared into the bag for a while, not meaning to.",19,80
1pyabas,,My eyes got lost in the red and pink mixture that slid with every slight movement. The image of the girl popped into my head and wouldn’t seem to leave.,30,81
1pyabas,,"“You’re thinking about her, aren’t you?” Mom asked.",8,82
1pyabas,,"Over time, I’ve learned many moms have this ability to predict exactly what their child is thinking, or at least offer a good guess.",24,83
1pyabas,,"“She was around your age.”

I looked at my mom, then back into the bag. She dropped the rabbit onto the wood slab and knelt in front of me.",29,84
1pyabas,,"“I know you’re lonely, but you know it has to be this way,” she said. “But why?” I asked.",19,85
1pyabas,,"“You never tell me.”

“I tell you that you need to trust me,” she said before standing back up.",19,86
1pyabas,,"“And that should be the only explanation you need.”

It wasn’t, though.",12,87
1pyabas,,"I don’t know if it was the fact that my mind was changing in adolescence or I’d finally had enough, but I’d already started thinking of ways I could sneak away and meet that girl again.",36,88
1pyabas,,"“I know what will make you feel better,” Mom said before taking off her blood-stained gloves and going inside.",19,89
1pyabas,,"She came back out a few minutes later, holding something behind her back. She stopped in front of me, and my hands started to shake with excitement.",27,90
1pyabas,,I’d never gotten a gift before and never expected one. The feeling of excitement was something I hadn’t had much experience with.,22,91
1pyabas,,She paused for a few more moments as I felt I was about to burst.,15,92
1pyabas,,"She finally revealed what looked like a light brown mass, the color of a dying tree. She smiled as he handed it to me. It felt smooth and almost sticky.",30,93
1pyabas,,"I pulled the edges apart to see that it was a new mask, but it was nothing like the ones I'd had before.",23,94
1pyabas,,"This one had actual facial features: a mouth with lips, a nose like my mom's, and eyebrows. “I made it with rabbit skins,” she said.",25,95
1pyabas,,"“I thought you'd like having one that looks like an actual face.”

I stared at it, trying to appear grateful but struggling to understand how I actually felt.",28,96
1pyabas,,"“Well, try it on,” she said. I did as she asked, pulling the thin leather across my head and to my neck. It fit tightly against my head.",28,97
1pyabas,,The eyeholes were perfectly situated so I wouldn't have to pull the mask down to see.,16,98
1pyabas,,"“You probably won't want to wear it in the summer, but I tried to make it more comfortable and durable than your last one.”

I breathed in the gamey smell of the leather and pressed my tongue against the inside of my mouth.",43,99
1pyabas,,"“Well, what do you think?” She asked. “Thanks,” I said, wishing it looked more like Spider-Man’s. \---

Mom was always exhausted after a day of hunting, especially during the summer.",30,100
1pyabas,,"It was almost impossible to wake her up. Once she fell asleep, I snuck out of the cabin and into the woods.",22,101
1pyabas,,"I followed the path, remembering what Monty said about their RV being two miles down the trail.",17,102
1pyabas,,"As I walked in the darkness, I wondered why I was trying so hard to see this girl again.",19,103
1pyabas,,"I’d been fine living my whole life without anyone besides Mom, though, I’d begun to wonder if that feeling of complacency came from a secluded life.",26,104
1pyabas,,I’d been walking around for half an hour when I heard voices a few yards away.,16,105
1pyabas,,I ducked into the nearby trees and spotted a fire that gave way to a dingy brown RV.,18,106
1pyabas,,"Monty sat in a chair beside the fire while Jamie danced around it. I moved closer without meaning to, not realizing I was no longer hidden.",26,107
1pyabas,,"Jamie spotted me as she rounded the fire. I watched her say something to him before she came skipping towards me. “Hey, Spider-Man,” she said.",25,108
1pyabas,,"“I like your new mask.”

“Thanks,” I said. “My name is Nestor.”

“Mmm, I like Spider-Man better,” she said.",19,109
1pyabas,,"“Come on, I told my dad I was going to pee, but I want to show you something.”

She grabbed my hand and pulled me into the woods.",28,110
1pyabas,,"Her hand was soft and warm, despite it being chilly that night. I still remember that.",16,111
1pyabas,,The temperature of her hand left an impression on mine that seemed to remain for years.,16,112
1pyabas,,We walked a few yards more until she stopped at a small ditch with a thin stream at the bottom.,20,113
1pyabas,,She smiled at me before sliding down to the edge of the stream. I paused before following.,17,114
1pyabas,,"At the bottom, she caught my arm and stopped me from going face-first into the creek. She laughed, and I laughed back. “Look, she said, pointing in the creek.",29,115
1pyabas,,"I scanned the surface of the dark water, unsure of what she was pointing at. “Tadpoles,” she said with excitement.",20,116
1pyabas,,"I looked again, and in the moon's reflection, I saw tiny black dots swimming near the edge of the creek. “They’ll grow legs soon,” she said.",26,117
1pyabas,,"“That’s what I learned in school. Do you go to school?”

I shook my head.",15,118
1pyabas,,"“Yeah, I’m not right now, but my dad said I can go back soon, when we leave the woods.”

Despite not knowing her well, the thought of her leaving made my chest hurt.",33,119
1pyabas,,"“Jamie!” cried Monty from somewhere in the woods. “I gotta go,” she said softly. “Come visit me again.",18,120
1pyabas,,"Just whistle three times, and I’ll come find you in the woods.”

She climbed up the ditch and waved before disappearing.",21,121
1pyabas,,"\----

I only went to visit her on the nights my mom was exhausted. Sometimes, Jamie was already in bed when I arrived.",23,122
1pyabas,,"We only saw each other once every couple of weeks, but the times we saw each other made up for all the time away that I wanted to see her.",30,123
1pyabas,,Seeing her was like seeing sunshine after weeks of rain.,10,124
1pyabas,,"On these late-night meetings, Jamie told me all about her life out of the woods; the friends she had back in her hometown, the restaurants she missed, the afternoons she spent at their local library reading whichever book had the coolest cover.",42,125
1pyabas,,“Have you ever read *The Boxcar Children*?” she asked me one night. I shook my head.,16,126
1pyabas,,"My mom had a small collection of books, and most were too long for me to be interested in.",19,127
1pyabas,,The only three I had read from her collection were one about local wildlife and an old cookbook with faded letters.,21,128
1pyabas,,"“Whenever I leave, you can visit me, and I’ll let you borrow it,” she said while hitting tall blades of grass with a stick. “I have the whole collection.",29,129
1pyabas,,"Oh, and we can go to the movies. I love going to the movies.",14,130
1pyabas,,"I used to go all the time with my mom and dad before they broke up.”

“Broke up?” I asked.",20,131
1pyabas,,"“Yeah, it’s like when adults decide they don’t like each other anymore, so they stop living together.”

She knew so much more than me about movies, books, the world, everything.",30,132
1pyabas,,"“You’ve really lived out here your whole life, Spider-Man?” she asked. “Yeah. I think so,” I said. “That’s cool.",19,133
1pyabas,,"You’re like this guy in this movie I like called *Tarzan*, except you weren’t raised by gorillas, right?” She laughed. We found a clearing and sat in the cool grass.",30,134
1pyabas,,"Fireflies flew around the tall grass like embers. We looked at each other, and she smiled, and I smiled back.",20,135
1pyabas,,"She picked at the grass to her side, randomly glancing at me. “Why do you wear a mask?” she asked, not looking up at me.",25,136
1pyabas,,"I knew it would come up eventually, though I liked how long she’d gone before asking.",16,137
1pyabas,,"“My mom says something bad will happen,” I said, wondering if I should’ve come up with a cooler reason.",19,138
1pyabas,,"She picked at the grass for a few more seconds before standing up and dusting her hands. “Works for me,” she said before offering her hand to help me up.",30,139
1pyabas,,"And as we stood in the moonlight, I knew there was no way my face was nearly as nice as hers.",21,140
1pyabas,,"\---

We’d met each other every few weeks for around a year without either of us getting caught, though, I got the feeling her dad wouldn’t care as much as my mom would.",33,141
1pyabas,,"One night when I came back, my mom was waiting in the yard, staring into the woods. She spotted me, and her eyes grew wide with anger.",27,142
1pyabas,,"“Where the hell were you!?” she cried, moving towards me like an angry bull.",14,143
1pyabas,,"She grabbed me by the shoulders and tried to look in my eyes, but I refused to meet them. “Just out for a walk,” I said.",26,144
1pyabas,,"“You were meeting that girl, weren’t you?” she asked. “You know we can’t trust them!”

I pulled away from my mom, and she stepped back, surprised.",26,145
1pyabas,,"“What’s wrong with you?” she asked. “She’s my friend,” I said. “My only friend.”

“I thought I was your friend,” she returned, her voice dropping. I paused.",27,146
1pyabas,,“Friends don’t keep secrets from each other. You don’t tell me anything. Mom looked at the ground. I could see the thoughts racing through her head. She was considering something.,30,147
1pyabas,,“Why do we have to stay here?” I asked. “Why can’t I have friends?,14,148
1pyabas,,"Why can’t I go to school?”

…

“Why do I have to wear a mask?”

Mom bit her lip, and her eyes met mine.",24,149
1pyabas,,"They were red and ready to break with tears. I waited for an answer, hoping she’d finally decided to share something with me. She gripped her fists, then released them.",30,150
1pyabas,,"She sighed and started back to the cabin, leaving me where I was standing. “Keep playing with her if you want,” she said.",23,151
1pyabas,,"“Just keep your mask on.”

\---

Another year or so passed.",11,152
1pyabas,,"I was still frustrated with my mom for not sharing more information with me, but I was happy I didn’t have to sneak out to meet Jamie.",27,153
1pyabas,,"We even started meeting in the daylight, making it much easier to explore the woods together.",16,154
1pyabas,,"I showed her all the things I’d learned over the years, about how to identify poisonous plants, how to find your way home if you got lost, and how to track animals…

“Wow, you know a lot about the woods!” she said.",42,155
1pyabas,,"“Why didn’t you ever tell me?”

I shrugged. “Will you teach me how to shoot a bow and arrow?” she asked.",21,156
1pyabas,,"Mom had just taught me, so I wasn’t sure how well I could teach her.",15,157
1pyabas,,"However, the pleas in her eyes kept me from saying “no.” We found a spot near a clearing in the woods where my mom would often hunt for quails.",29,158
1pyabas,,"We ducked behind a log, and I set up the bow and arrow on top of it. A small flock of quail bobbed in and out of the tall grass.",30,159
1pyabas,,I picked a large one closer to us than the rest and aimed the arrow just as Mom had taught me.,21,160
1pyabas,,"The quail bobbed again, and I took a deep breath before letting the arrow go.",15,161
1pyabas,,"The flock flew into the air, leaving the arrow on the ground, pointed towards the sky.",16,162
1pyabas,,We walked to the clearing and found the quail struck through its chest with the arrow. “That was amazing!” she cried.,21,163
1pyabas,,"“I want to try!”

It was the first animal I’d ever killed on my own, and I loved that Jamie was here to see it.",25,164
1pyabas,,It made me realize that I wanted her there for all the big moments in my life. We went back to the log with my quail and hid.,28,165
1pyabas,,An hour or so passed before the flock returned and started picking at seeds and insects on the ground. I handed Jamie the bow and arrow.,26,166
1pyabas,,"“What do I do?” she asked, holding the bow and arrow at her sides.",14,167
1pyabas,,"“You have to show me, silly.”

I awkwardly moved towards her and placed my arms around her shoulders.",18,168
1pyabas,,"I lifted her arm with the arrow, then the one with the bow. I positioned them in the right spots, slowly.",21,169
1pyabas,,"Her hair smelled like sweat and dirt, but I liked it. “Um, you have to aim and take a breath before shooting,” I said.",24,170
1pyabas,,"“You need to make sure you’re completely relaxing, and taking a breath helps.”

“Okay,” she said.",16,171
1pyabas,,"“How far do I pull the string back?”

I gulped before putting my hand over hers. She breathed quickly as if I scared her, but quickly settled into my arms.",30,172
1pyabas,,"I cupped my hand around hers and pulled the string back. She looked at me and smiled. “I think I got it,” she said.",24,173
1pyabas,,I moved away as I noticed my heart beating harder than it ever had. She aimed the arrow and took a breath.,22,174
1pyabas,,"She let it go, and the flock flew away. We both watched the arrow for a moment and saw it move.",21,175
1pyabas,,"We ran to it and saw the quail shot in the side. I pulled the arrow out, and the tiny bird struggled to move away from us.",27,176
1pyabas,,"“Oh no,” she said. I could see her starting to cry. “It’s okay,” I said, picking up the quail and holding it between us.",24,177
1pyabas,,"“Do you think we can hel-”

Before she could finish her thought, I twisted the bird’s neck, and it went limp.",21,178
1pyabas,,"I held it to him, and she stared at me wide-eyed. I cocked my head at her, but she looked away.",21,179
1pyabas,,"“It’s okay, you can keep it,” she said…

We spent the rest of that day at a clearing close to her campsite.",22,180
1pyabas,,"She poked at rocks with her pocket knife and stared at the forest, not saying anything.",16,181
1pyabas,,"I was about to ask her what was wrong when she dropped her head and began sobbing. “What’s wrong?” I asked. She looked back up, then to me.",28,182
1pyabas,,"“I want to go home.”

I dropped my head. “I know my dad is hiding me from my mom,” she said.",21,183
1pyabas,,“He picked me up from school one day and told me we were going on a fun trip and that we’d go home soon.,24,184
1pyabas,,"I believed him for a long time, but I’m not a stupid kid anymore…. I miss my mom.",18,185

I know she didn’t mean to make me feel bad, but hearing all this hurt.",20,186
1pyabas,,"I thought she was happy out here with me, that all we needed was each other. “I want to leave,” she said.",22,187

I sat back. “What? I can’t… I can’t leave.”

She pursed her lips and set her head on her knees.",28,188
1pyabas,,"“Why do you wear that mask?”

“I have to.”

“Because your mom says.”

I paused, then nodded. “Your mom’s lying, just like my dad is.",25,189
1pyabas,,"I bet you a million dollars, nothing will happen if you take off your mask right now.”

She moved her hand towards me and gripped the neck of the mask.",30,190
1pyabas,,"I pulled back, and she let go. She paused and tried again, and this time, I allowed her to untie the twine.",22,191
1pyabas,,"Everything seemed to move in slow motion as she gently pulled upwards on the mask, careful to avoid yanking too hard around my nose and eyes.",26,192
1pyabas,,"Everything went black as the last bit of the mask traveled up my face, but then, Jamie’s smiling face greeted me with the sun behind it.",26,193
1pyabas,,"We stared at each other for several moments. “See, nothing,” she said. “And you don’t have any hideous scars or anything.”

“Really?” I asked.",24,194
1pyabas,,"She shook her head, then leaned in, kissing me on the lips. My eyes widened in surprise for a moment, but I quickly relaxed as it felt right… perfect.",29,195
1pyabas,,"She pulled away and smiled again. My smile was so big my cheeks started to hurt. “Let’s leave… tonight,” she said. “Tonight?” 

She nodded.",24,196
1pyabas,,"“I can grab food and stuff to last us a while, and you can use your forest knowledge to lead us back to the road.",25,197
1pyabas,,Some adults will have to pick up some kids they see on the side of the road.,17,198
1pyabas,,"I’ll tell them where my mom lives, and we can go back there.”

“Your mom would let me stay?” I asked. She nodded.",23,199
1pyabas,,"“Of course.”

She stood up and offered her hand to me. I took it and pulled myself up.",18,200
1pyabas,,"“Meet me here when the moon is in the center of the sky,” she said. A thousand thoughts went through my mind as I stood there, holding Jamie’s hand.",29,201
1pyabas,,"I wondered if this was really a good idea, if my mom would be okay without me, if I was ready to leave the woods… but I knew I could do all of it as long as I was with Jamie.",41,202
1pyabas,,"I nodded. She started out of the clearing with me a few feet behind her. She paused, causing me to stop.",21,203
1pyabas,,"She stood still for several seconds with her arms at her sides, the pocket knife in her hand shaking. “Jamie?” I asked.",22,204
1pyabas,,"“Are you okay?”

She turned to me with wide eyes and her mouth clenched. “Jamie?”

I moved towards her, but she lifted the knife.",24,205
1pyabas,,"I stood frozen as she moved it towards her head, holding it a few inches from her cheek. “Ja-”

She stuck the knife deep in her face, and I screamed.",30,206
1pyabas,,"She pulled against the handle, dragging the blade along her face. I ran to stop her, but a kick to my stomach sent me to the ground.",27,207
1pyabas,,"Jamie continued cutting her face, dragging it along her forehead and down to her ears.",15,208
1pyabas,,"I leapt up to stop her again, but again and again, she managed to keep me away while continuing to slice her flesh. “Jamie!” cried a voice from the woods.",30,209
1pyabas,,Monty distracted me for a moment as he came running into the clearing from behind me.,16,210
1pyabas,,"“I heard a scream,” he said while approaching, and noticed the knife in Jamie’s face and the blood running down her neck. “Jamie!” he cried.",25,211
1pyabas,,"He ran quickly towards her, glancing at me along the way.",11,212
1pyabas,,"He paused a few feet behind me, and I stood between the two of them as the horrible sounds of Jamie’s knife still working down her face filled my ears and made my legs immobile.",35,213
1pyabas,,"Monty stared blank-faced at me for a moment, then dug into his pocket without looking down.",16,214
1pyabas,,"He pulled out a much larger knife than Jamie’s and stuck it into his own cheek, starting to cut along the same pattern she had.",25,215
1pyabas,,"I clocked the silence from behind me and turned. I didn’t want to see what Jamie had done, but I couldn’t stop myself.",23,216
1pyabas,,"My brain wanted to leave as quickly as I could, but something buried deep told me to look…

I looked upon a bloody mess of musculature.",26,217
1pyabas,,"Her eyelids were still there, though she didn’t blink. Her nose was gone, as were her lips, revealing two rows of small teeth.",23,218
1pyabas,,"The sounds of Monty continuing to slice sounded behind me as my eyes traveled down Jamie’s body. At her side, I saw what was left of her face.",28,219
1pyabas,,"She lifted her arm and held it up to me. It looked like a …. I wanted to scream, but couldn’t. Instead, I ran.",24,220
1pyabas,,"I ran as fast as I could back to the cabin, pulling my mask back over my face along the way.",21,221
1pyabas,,"\---

Mom was peeling the husks from some corn when I ran into the yard. I stumbled to the ground, and she ran over.",24,222
1pyabas,,"The inside of my mask was soaked with tears, and I was having trouble breathing in it. “Nestor, what's wrong?” She asked, kneeling in front of me.",27,223
1pyabas,,"Her fingers drifted to the untied twine at the bottom of my neck. “Oh no,” she said. “Did she… did she see your face?”

“They're still alive,” I said.",29,224
1pyabas,,"“We can take them out of the woods.”

“It's too late for them, son… I'm sorry.”

I cried violently for another few moments, then looked at my mom… “When you said something bad would happen if someone saw my face, you didn't mean something bad would happen to me, did you?”

\---

I sat in the kitchen while Mom brought me a cool glass of water.",66,225
1pyabas,,"I could tell she was stalling, but I didn't care. Everything was wrong, and nothing she said would make it better.",21,226
1pyabas,,She sat in front of me and grabbed my hand. “I didn't want to tell you.,16,227
1pyabas,,"I hoped I would never have to.” She looked from side to side, then at me.",16,228
1pyabas,,"“In the town I grew up in, this small place on the other side of the woods, there were stories of things in the forest.",25,229
1pyabas,,"Things that only showed themselves when they wanted to be seen: spirits, ghosts… monsters.” 

“Natives had a name for this particular brand of spirits that I can’t remember,” she continued, “Us in town always just called them Face Stealers.”

My heart stopped beating for a moment.",46,230
1pyabas,,"“Folks said if you looked at their faces, they would take yours… All us kids figured they were just stories meant to keep us from wandering too far into the woods.",31,231
1pyabas,,"That’s what adults do, right? Tell kids fibs to keep them from getting hurt? That’s what I learned to do, Nestor, and I’m wondering if it was right.",28,232
1pyabas,,"I’m wondering if I should’ve just told you this stuff from the beginning.” She sighed. I wanted to say something, but my mind couldn’t find the words.",27,233
1pyabas,,"“I went most of my life believing that there was no such thing as magic and things were only the way you saw them,” Mom said before pausing and looking at me.",32,234
1pyabas,,"“One day, I was walking in the woods, just trying to clear my head. I might've wandered farther than I should have, but I grew up around the trees.",29,235
1pyabas,,"I knew how to find my way back.”

“As I was fixin’ to turn around, I noticed a man a few yards away from me, off the trail.",28,236
1pyabas,,"I didn't think nothin’ of it at first. Figured he was out huntin’ or something like that, but when he turned to me… his face was missing. Cut clean off.",30,237
1pyabas,,"Took everything except his teeth and ears.”

My hands started to shake.",12,238
1pyabas,,"I didn’t want to believe anything she was saying, but the image of Jamie’s skinless face refused to leave my head.",21,239
1pyabas,,"“I started walking backwards, thinking, this man must’ve lost his mind.",11,240
1pyabas,,"But it started to occur to me that maybe all those stories I thought were bullshit actually had some truth to them.”

She looked at me, then away.",28,241
1pyabas,,It was the first time I’d ever heard her curse.,10,242
1pyabas,,"“I kept moving away from the man when I saw this small body facing away from me, a few yards away, off the trail.",24,243
1pyabas,,"A kid, no older than two or three, completely naked in the woods by themselves.",15,244
1pyabas,,"I walked towards them, thinking they might be in danger from the man… then, I saw it.",17,245
1pyabas,,"A clump of skin on the ground in a pile like some fucked up ant hill.”

“The holes for his eyes were the only thing I saw before turning away.",30,246
1pyabas,,"I didn't know what to do. I thought about just leaving you out there, but then, you started to cry, a painful cry that broke my heart….",27,247
1pyabas,,"I couldn't have kids of my own, but…” She swallowed her saliva.",12,248
1pyabas,,"“I wrapped my outside shirt over your head and picked you up, and when you wrapped your tiny arms around my neck, I knew that I had to protect you, so I just kept walking deeper and deeper into the woods, not knowing what to do but hoping I'd figure it out along the way.”

She answered the first question I had without me having to say anything.",68,249
1pyabas,,"“I don’t know who left you there or why,” she said.",11,250
1pyabas,,"“I wondered if your real parents would ever come looking for you, and maybe that’s partly why I wanted us to stay as hidden as we could.” Her eyes drifted to me.",32,251
1pyabas,,"There was a long, heavy silence.",6,252
1pyabas,,"“Nestor,” she started, “I don't want to ask, son, but I think I have to… When your friend did what she did… did you like it?”

\---

Of course, I didn't like it, I thought as I wandered back through the woods.",42,253
1pyabas,,"I didn't have time to examine my emotions at the moment, though. I thought I was terrified, but had I confused excitement for terror?",24,254
1pyabas,,The sun was beginning to set when I made it to the spot where Jamie and Monty lay.,18,255
1pyabas,,"They were both on their backs, their bodies still against the bright green grass.",14,256
1pyabas,,"I warily approached, not wanting to see what had become of their faces, but unable to stop myself.",18,257
1pyabas,,"I stopped just shy of their bodies and noticed something on the ground. A small mound of pink flesh stared back at me, and I knew it was her face.",30,258
1pyabas,,"I didn’t move for a few moments, my stomach turning at the idea of what her face might look like detached from her body.",24,259
1pyabas,,"Still, I moved towards it, seeing a few insects had begun picking away at the flesh.",16,260
1pyabas,,"I picked it up, dusting the small creatures away while feeling the softness of the flesh between my fingers.",19,261
1pyabas,,"As the stinky blood coated my palms, I felt the side of my mouth begin to curl into a smile.",20,262
1pyabas,,"I gasped and dropped Jamie's face before running away from the scene, wiping the blood from my hands onto my pants.",21,263
1pyabas,,"\---

I sat in my room staring at the wall for a long time. My body still buzzed from the feeling of Jamie’s face between my fingers.",27,264
1pyabas,,"The fear and sickness had all disappeared, instead replaced with an elation I’d never experienced.",15,265
1pyabas,,"My body felt light, and the constant fear and anxiety that usually filled my brain had gone away.",18,266
1pyabas,,"I felt confident and more intelligent, though it seemed impossible at the time. I sat with the feeling, not wanting it to leave.",23,267
1pyabas,,"However, when it did, I felt worse than I ever had.",11,268
1pyabas,,A dark cloud seemed to surround my head as my body felt heavy and bound to the space around me.,20,269
1pyabas,,The realization that I would never see my best friend again came rushing into me.,15,270
1pyabas,,And the guilt of knowing I had caused her death made me wish I were the one lying lifeless in the grass instead of her.,25,271
1pyabas,,I cried for the next few hours until it felt like I had no tears left.,16,272
1pyabas,,"My mom had come by to check on me several times, but avoided coming into my room. “Just let me know if you need something, okay?” she asked once.",29,273
1pyabas,,I heard her move to her room and shut the door. She never closed her room at night before that day.,21,274
1pyabas,,"I could tell there was something different about her, and it’d become more evident over the next few days.",19,275
1pyabas,,"She no longer walked around the house like an authority figure, but more like someone trying to avoid eye contact with a mean dog.",24,276
1pyabas,,"She never brought up the incident again, and I was thankful for it.",13,277
1pyabas,,"The guilt of killing Jamie never went away, though neither did the remembrance of that ecstasy I experienced afterwards.",19,278
1pyabas,,It created a temptation in me to go out and find someone else to whom I could show my face.,20,279
1pyabas,,"It became a regular craving; usually, it was more like one might crave sugar after going a long time without any, but some nights, it was almost comparable to starvation.",30,280
1pyabas,,"It became so bad that one day, I saw my mom working outside, busy and distracted with chores. I approached from behind and started removing my mask without thinking.",29,281
1pyabas,,"My mom heard me approach and spun around, dropping the garden hoe she’d been using…

The look of fear in her face, the woman who’d ensured my survival, who’d loved me despite knowing I was a monster… Seeing her that terrified of me, it almost hurt worse than Jamie…

Mom slept with a chair against her door that night and for most nights after.",64,282
1pyabas,,"While she was sleeping one night, I snuck into her craft room, spotting a large needle she used on leather.",20,283
1pyabas,,"I grabbed it, taking a thick roll of twine as well. Jamie's face flashed in my mind.",17,284
1pyabas,,"First, her face the first time I'd met her, followed by the last time.",14,285
1pyabas,,"I knew it was horrible, but my emotions and my brain weren't matching, and at the time, I felt like my brain was right.",24,286
1pyabas,,"If the cravings weren’t going to stop, then I needed to prevent my mask from ever coming off again.",19,287
1pyabas,,"I took the needle and twine and held them to my neck for a moment before taking a deep breath. The needle punctured my skin, then the mask leather.",29,288
1pyabas,,I cringed as the twine slid through my flesh and felt every centimeter of its rough edges scraping the inside of my skin….,23,289
1pyabas,,Lines of crimson fell from every puncture in my neck. The harsh stinging I’d felt when I first punctured my skin had become a dull pain.,26,290
1pyabas,,"For the first time in my life, the mask felt warm and comforting.",13,291
1pyabas,,"I breathed in its leathery smell before lying back on my bed, thankful I’d never hurt anyone like I’d hurt Jamie.",21,292

My bed is much more comfortable these days. I invested in a weighted blanket and a goose down pillow, and you truly can tell the difference.",30,293
1pyabas,,"In a month, it’ll be 10 years since I left the woods.",12,294
1pyabas,,"Mom died a year prior, and being out there by myself… Well, it was lonelier than I can describe, though, on some nights, I would give a lot of money for the peace and quiet of the woods.",38,295
1pyabas,,"My apartment overlooks a bustling downtown area, and while the view is amazing, the noise of the city can be a bit overwhelming at times.",25,296
1pyabas,,"Thank God for the noise-cancelling headphones my ex-girlfriend gifted me for Christmas last year. Though it’s my day off, I decide to do some cleaning.",25,297
1pyabas,,"I never got around to hiring a new cleaner, and the place has become a bit of a sty.",19,298
1pyabas,,"I go to the bathroom and look in the mirror for a moment, seeing my night mask staring back at me.",21,299
1pyabas,,"It’s more lucid than any of the masks I had growing up, but thick enough to prevent me from seeing my actual face.",23,300
1pyabas,,"This mask is milky white and made of a thin plastic. It only covers my face, leaving my hair, ears, and neck visible.",23,301
1pyabas,,The scars where I’d sown that old mask on became a pale white over the years.,16,302
1pyabas,,"No one ever asked about them, though; there were only a few people who’ve ever seen me with my shirt off.",21,303
1pyabas,,"Lining the bathroom counter are several other masks, ones I made myself from materials I’ve collected over the years. I’ve been perfecting them since leaving the woods.",27,304
1pyabas,,"I was able to get away with crude masks for a while, using the excuse of having bad scarring, but I realized how much better it was to get close to someone before doing what I had to do.",39,305
1pyabas,,"And people want something they can see, eyes that react to them, lips that move, cheeks that wrinkle when smiling. I think I’ve almost got my masks perfect.",28,306
1pyabas,,They contour to every crease of my face and match my skin color perfectly. Only sometimes will someone notice something “off” about my face.,24,307
1pyabas,,Maybe they spot a plasticy sheen to the synthetic skin or see makeup lines around my lips or eyes.,19,308
1pyabas,,"They only make a look of concern and continue about their day, wondering if what they saw was only their imagination…

I decide to clean my room first, starting with the mess of clothes in the closet.",37,309
1pyabas,,"Before getting started, though, I decide to reminisce and drag out the leather box near the back corner of the closet.",21,310
1pyabas,,I place it on my bed and pull the flap open. A smile climbs up my cheeks.,17,311
1pyabas,,"I’ve managed to preserve most of them, with the latest ones being those of my ex-girlfriend and the cleaner's.",19,312
1pyabas,,"There are 23 in total, but I have plans for several more, so I’m probably going to need to find a better storage system.",24,313
1pyabas,,Seeing all the empty eye sockets and jagged edges of the faces always makes me feel a slight amount of the elation I felt upon taking them.,27,314
1pyabas,,"It also makes me sad, though. Sad that I didn’t go back for her face before the forest took it.",20,315
1pya4sw,I bought a tapestry at an auction and now I can never go back,"She was beautiful. Her skin fair. Her ocean blue eyes almond shaped, staring off into the distance.",17,0

1pya4sw,,"As the room begins to darken, I yawn and decide to prepare myself for bed. I toss and turn.",19,8
1pya4sw,,"I have never had problems with sleep, and yet, sleep won’t come. I feel a longing. It pulls me out of bed. I stumble towards the living room. Towards her.",30,9

“Must have been some tree-hugger types that built it,” Mark said, shrugging, “might as well check it out while we're here, huh?”

Despite all the once-bright colors of carnival festivity, I found my attention being drawn towards the center of the grounds.",60,29
1py8ylo,,Towards the big oak.,4,30
1py8ylo,,"“You think they built this park around that tree on purpose?” I asked, pointing it out to my brother, who had gotten to work checking all the empty stalls for loose change or knick-knacks.",34,31
1py8ylo,,"“Huh,” he started to ask, following my outstretched finger until his gaze landed on the tree, then passed right over it, “what tree are you talking about, Liz?",28,32
1py8ylo,,"Are you on shrooms again?” 

My face flashed hot, “That was one time, and once again, it was *your idea!* Quit holding it over my head!” I yelled at him.",30,33
1py8ylo,,He had to have been fucking with me; there was no way he couldn’t see the tree.,17,34
1py8ylo,,"It looked big enough for four people to hug all at once and probably still not touch fingers. “Okay, hippie.",20,35
1py8ylo,,"Come help me get this door open,” he teased as he fiddled with the tarnished knob on the door that led to the back of a run-down performance stage.",29,36
1py8ylo,,"“What's back there that you could *possibly* want? And didn't you *just* get out of jail? Breaking and entering is a crime, y’know,” I scoffed.",25,37
1py8ylo,,"“BrEaKiNg AnD eNtErInG iS a CrImE y'KnOw,” he mocked me, “and I don't know what's in there. Duh.",18,38
1py8ylo,,"That's why I want the door open, so I can find out, anyone who cared about this stuff obviously isn't here.” He motioned to the mess around us.",28,39
1py8ylo,,"“Just move,” I said, annoyed, but unable to disagree with his last sentiment, “*prick*,” I said under my breath before leveling a kick at the door just beside the handle.",30,40
1py8ylo,,"The decayed wood of the door buckled inwards, and Mark was able to push the rest of the way through, but a sharp pain in my ankle when I set my foot back down told me that I had probably overdone it.",42,41
1py8ylo,,"“Ouch,” I muttered in response to the sharp sensation. “I'm not carrying you back!” Was my brother's response, from already halfway inside the second room of the building.",28,42
1py8ylo,,"I tried to maintain a steady walk out of spite, but every footfall sent another stab up the side of my calf. Inside the building was exactly what I expected.",30,43
1py8ylo,,"Costumes, props, fake instruments, and a few random t-shirts with Ophie Opossum and other woodland mascots on them. “Liz! Come quick! I need help!",24,44
1py8ylo,,My leg is stuck in the floor!” Mark called from the next room over.,14,45
1py8ylo,,"He may have been older, but I had spent most of our childhood together bailing him out of his bad decisions, so my sisterly instincts kicked in and I ran around the corner, ignoring my throbbing ankle.",37,46
1py8ylo,,"“Mark? Where are you?” I didn't immediately see him, and I was worried that he had fallen into a subfloor or something.",22,47
1py8ylo,,"Then a curtain was thrown back, and I saw it.",10,48
1py8ylo,,"The antlers were bent and broken in places, and a single eye remained in its socket while the other hung limply by the nerve.",24,49
1py8ylo,,The fur was moldy and tattered around the joints.,9,50
1py8ylo,,"The neck was long, too long, and bent in two places; and worst of all, the silhouette body it was attached to looked human. I screamed.",26,51
1py8ylo,,"“Bohahah-” Came my brother's attempt at a noise to scare me, but the damage was done just by the sight of that awful mascot head, and my fist was already in motion.",32,52
1py8ylo,,"It landed firmly into his ribs, knocking the wind out of him for a moment and cutting off his noise.",20,53
1py8ylo,,"He pulled off the mascot head and tossed it aside, laughing and smiling ear to ear as he clutched his side where I'd hit him.",25,54
1py8ylo,,"“Worth it,” he croaked out through his teeth. “Ugh! I am so done with you, we are leaving!” I screamed as I half-limped out of the building.",27,55
1py8ylo,,"I stopped before I made it to the open doorway. Outside, I could hear small footfalls, as well as clucking and gobbling.",22,56
1py8ylo,,"I peeked through the doorway, and, sure enough, there was a whole flock of turkeys just outside the door, led by the biggest tom I'd ever seen.",27,57
1py8ylo,,"I heard a click behind me, and turned to see Mark checking the cylinders on the pistol he had just pulled from his waistband; a small, shiny .38 caliber revolver that he had just been given as an early Christmas gift by our father.",44,58
1py8ylo,,"“Don't you fucking dare,” I hissed out at him, “it's not gun season for turkey, you idiot,” I tried to reason.",21,59
1py8ylo,,"His reply was his smile, sly and mischievous as always. He crept up beside me and pointed the pistol through the door.",22,60
1py8ylo,,"“*DON'T!”* I shouted at him, spooking the turkeys, but it was too late. **Bang. Bang. Bang.",16,61
1py8ylo,,"Bang.**

The four shots rang out, and the clucking of the turkeys grew frantic as most of them took to the sky to escape the din.",26,62
1py8ylo,,"Two turkeys did not take off: the large tom, which had been hit twice in the body and was clearly dead, and one of the hens, which had only been winged and was flopping around trying to regain its footing.",40,63
1py8ylo,,"“Mark, why? You can't take it home with us, we're over a mile into the woods, and you only have a bike!” I questioned him, tears filling my eyes.",29,64
1py8ylo,,"Mark shrugged and said with a cheery voice, “Chill out, they're just animals.",13,65
1py8ylo,,It's not like they even know what happened anyway.” he pointed the gun at the turkey that was struggling in front of us. I turned my head away and sobbed.,30,66
1py8ylo,,"**Bang. Bang.** *Click.*

“Shit, out of ammo, I guess.",9,67
1py8ylo,,"At least I *ended its suffering.”* He said, sticking his tongue out and tilting his head to the side, mimicking the two dead turkeys now lying side by side in the leaf litter.",33,68
1py8ylo,,“Suffering that *you* caused!,4,69
1py8ylo,,"Didn't you read the *sign*…” I stopped myself from finishing the sentence, realizing how silly it sounded to be basing the immorality of a grown adult off of rules written on a decrepit fairgrounds rules board.",36,70
1py8ylo,,"I hadn't stopped soon enough. “The *sign*? What, are you afraid that giant ‘possum up at the gate is gonna come for me?",23,71
1py8ylo,,"Or do you think the goddamn Turkeyman is gonna hunt me down for killing his kinfolk?” He spat at me as he kicked the hen aside and bent down, pulling a knife from his boot and getting to work cutting the head and tail off of the tom.",48,72
1py8ylo,,"“These are the only parts I want anyway, you can have a *funeral* for the rest, if you'd like,” he sneered. I never remembered him being this cruel.",28,73
1py8ylo,,"An asshole, maybe, inconsiderate always, but this crossed the line. “I'm leaving, Mark. Find your way back to Momma's house, or don't.",22,74
1py8ylo,,"I don't care anymore.” I said, as I began making my way back towards the gate where we had come in, but before I got too far, something else caught my eye.",32,75
1py8ylo,,"The tree. We were somehow closer to it now, despite walking in the opposite direction to get to the stage.",20,76
1py8ylo,,"“Hey, genius, gates *that* way.” He said, pointing in the direction we had come from. But he was wrong.",19,77
1py8ylo,,"I looked back in the direction where he gestured, and saw only the fence. No ticket booth, no gate, no Ophie O sign.",23,78
1py8ylo,,"“What?” he asked himself as he looked in the direction he was pointing and noticed the same thing that I had. “No way, we definitely came from there.",28,79
1py8ylo,,"Look, there's our bikes just on the other side of the fence!”

He wasn't wrong, our bikes were still parked right there, his leaned against the same pine tree from before, and mine on the kick stand just feet away from his.",42,80
1py8ylo,,"“Maybe someone's pranking us, I don't know, but the gate is way over there,” I said, pointing to the gate, ticket booth, and opossum sign that stood far out, on the other side of the tree.",36,81
1py8ylo,,"“Yeah, you're right… must have gotten turned around somewhere, and somebody must have moved our bikes. I'm leaving with you.",20,82
1py8ylo,,"Momma'd kill me if I left you out here this close to dark,” Mark said, checking his watch, “It's already 5:05.",21,83
1py8ylo,,"Sun's gonna set soon anyway.”

We started walking towards the gate together, but I refused to look at him.",19,84
1py8ylo,,"He was still carrying his bloody trophies; he'd stashed them away in a small cloth bag from inside the stage room, but I could see the blood pooling and dripping from the bottom.",33,85
1py8ylo,,"The closer we got to the tree, the more unusual I noticed it was.",14,86
1py8ylo,,"Despite looking at it from a completely different angle now, the tree looked identical to how it had from the gate when I first saw it, only bigger; almost like how the moon follows you on clear nights and stays in the same spot in the sky no matter how far you drive.",53,87
1py8ylo,,I turned to Mark reluctantly. “Can you at least acknowledge the damn tree so I don't feel like a complete lunatic?,21,88
1py8ylo,,"It looks weird.”

Mark looked at me, genuine confusion crossing his face.",12,89
1py8ylo,,"“Sis, I don’t know what you're smoking, but you’re sharing some with me when we get back to the house.",20,90
1py8ylo,,"There ain't a tree where you're pointing.” He squinted for a moment in the direction of the tree, before adding, “Looks like you're pointing at a chair to me, a loveseat maybe?”

We were only feet away now, and the texture of the tree became clearer, but it was… wrong.",50,91
1py8ylo,,"Closer to the texture of a fingerprint, or the skin of a palm.",13,92
1py8ylo,,"Directly in front of us, I could see ropey tendrils hanging down from a fleshy protrusion above us, forming the vignette of a seat.",24,93
1py8ylo,,"The color was green enough to be a vine, but, like the tree, the texture was all wrong.",18,94
1py8ylo,,"“It's not a chair…” Mark said aloud, “It's the seat of a roller coaster.",14,95
1py8ylo,,"Must be a joke.” He looked up at the bark of the tree, where I could read words carved in bloody letters on the skin-bark.",25,96
1py8ylo,,"***“Sinner's Ascent: Single Occupant”***

“Billy Buck's Barleysack.” Mark read from whatever sign he was perceiving, “Hey, Liz, take my picture!” He exclaimed as he threw himself into the vines, ass-first.",30,97
1py8ylo,,"The second his weight touched the vines, they reacted.",9,98
1py8ylo,,"The vines wrapped around the closest appendage they could find; two around his neck, and one each around his arms and legs, then they all retracted, pulling him several feet into the tree.",33,99
1py8ylo,,"“Mark!” I screamed his name as I attempted to climb the tree to where he was being held, but my hands found no purchase on the slick, oily surface.",29,100
1py8ylo,,"I resorted to digging my nails into the soft mass, clawing at it until it bled, then punching and kicking the wound. Above me, I could hear Mark screaming.",29,101
1py8ylo,,I looked up. I wish I hadn't looked up.,9,102
1py8ylo,,"The vines had stretched Mark into a star pose, and I could tell by the way his body sagged against his joints that the vines were pulling *hard.* Then, additional vines fell around him and wrapped around his thighs, constricting tighter and tighter in unison until…

***Snap… Snap…***

As his femurs broke, I could hear Mark begging me to help.",60,103
1py8ylo,,"Begging for Momma. Begging God to save him, but if God heard him that day, He turned away.",18,104
1py8ylo,,"Mark's scream tore in his throat, growing in pitch until only a hoarse bleating noise passed his lips. I sobbed, kneeling at the tree and looking up at him.",29,105
1py8ylo,,"“I'm sorry, I'm so sorry…” I cried. Two more vines curled around Mark, this time looping around his upper arms.",20,106
1py8ylo,,"I looked away, knowing what would happen but not having the heart to watch. Two more sickening snaps and another minute of agonizing cries later, Mark fell silent.",28,107
1py8ylo,,I gazed up at him through tear-blurred eyes and saw that the vines had wrapped themselves around his neck and were pulling tight; his neck was now twice its original length.,31,108
1py8ylo,,"I watched as the vines slowly unfurled from around his arms and neck, and his limp body flopped loosely down, dangling now only by the vines around his legs.",29,109
1py8ylo,,"I watched as the vines around his legs loosened, then released altogether, and Mark fell several feet directly onto his head. I lost consciousness before I heard the impact.",29,110
1py8ylo,,"When I woke up, I was no longer in the park, and, as a matter of fact, the park was gone.",21,111
1py8ylo,,"Night had passed, and the early rays of morning light were peaking through the trees. My bike was lying next to me, and so was my brother's.",27,112
1py8ylo,,"I ignored the bike, which was useless to me with the state of my ankle, and limped back up the trail.",21,113
1py8ylo,,"The police found me before I made it to Momma's house. Momma had heard the shots from Mark's revolver last night, but didn't think much of it.",27,114
1py8ylo,,"When she woke up, and my car was still in the driveway, with my brother nowhere to be found, she assumed the worst. The cops assumed a completely different worst.",30,115
1py8ylo,,They thought I had made him disappear. I didn't bother telling my truth; I knew how it would be taken.,20,116
1py8ylo,,"I sat silently in the interrogation room and answered every question with “I don't know,” or “I don't remember.”

The blood and tissue under my nails were sampled and taken in as evidence, as well as the shirt I was wearing that night, which was also covered in blood.",49,117
1py8ylo,,"I don't know exactly what they found, but the officer who called Momma told her that I was no longer a suspect and that it would probably be a good idea for me to get a rabies vaccine and take grief counseling.",42,118
1py8ylo,,I was free to return home. I left without saying goodbye. I didn't even bother staying for Christmas. I've been home for a week.,24,119
1py8ylo,,"My ankle is fractured, but that is the least of my worries.",12,120
1py8ylo,,"I still see that tree in my dreams, and lingering at the edges of my vision when I find myself staring into nothing for too long.",26,121
1py8ylo,,"Worse than that, I see Mark. He's not dead in my dreams; he's much worse.",15,122
1py8ylo,,"He's crawling through the woods of Tennessee, broken and bent arms acting as a second set of legs, and that grotesque, moldy, one-eyed deer mask as a head, covering his bashed-in head attached to his too-long neck.",37,123
1py8ylo,,"If you ever see Ophie O’s Woodland Jamboree, don’t make the same mistake we did. **Don’t go inside.**",18,124
1py7w50,I went into the forbidden zone,"Every neighbourhood has a place children are warned never to cross. A tunnel, a fence, a creek, sometimes just a street or an abandoned house.",25,0
1py7w50,,"A line drawn in fear, and if you dare step past it, something bad will take you.",17,1
1py7w50,,"In my town, the forbidden zone was a decommissioned storm drain at the edge of town.",16,2
1py7w50,,"The story went that something lived inside it, something that might once have been a man. It would come out at night and prowl the nearby streets, searching for children.",30,3
1py7w50,,"Once it found one, it would shove the child into a large burlap sack and drag it back into the bowels of the drain, where it would devour them whole, leaving barely anything behind.",34,4
1py7w50,,"sometimes a shoe. Sometimes a tooth. others, just a fingernail. As children, we believed every word of it.",18,5
1py7w50,,"It became a common dare to see who was brave enough to approach the drain, or even step inside it.",20,6
1py7w50,,"And truth be told, the kids who took that challenge too far tended to go missing. Everyone said they’d fallen victim to the Bag Man.",25,7
1py7w50,,"Things got so bad that a curfew was issued, parents panicked, and eventually the drain was sealed off. After that, the disappearances stopped, and life returned to normal.",28,8
1py7w50,,"Children were safe again. Of course, as adults, we told ourselves the truth was simpler and far less supernatural. Storm drains are dangerous places.",24,9
1py7w50,,"Dark, slick, confusing mazes where a child could fall, get lost, drown, or break a neck without needing any monster at all. That was what I believed.",27,10
1py7w50,,That was what I told myself for years. Until I finally went in myself.,14,11
1py7w50,,"It had been a long time since I’d come back home, years since I’d even thought about the drain.",19,12
1py7w50,,"I was standing on my parent's porch one evening, watching the sun sink behind the hills, when I noticed a faint glimmer in the distance.",25,13
1py7w50,,"Too far away to make out clearly, but I knew exactly where it was coming from. The drain.",18,14
1py7w50,,"I stood there longer than I meant to, staring at that distant flicker of reflected light, chuckling to myself as I remembered the stories.",24,15
1py7w50,,"That was when the worst idea I’ve ever had crossed my mind. “Hey, Hunter! Want to do something cool?” I called into the house.",24,16
1py7w50,,"A few seconds later, a smiling face appeared at the doorway. “What are we doing, Uncle Micah?” he asked, adjusting the Lakers cap perched on his head.",27,17
1py7w50,,"“We’re going on an adventure,” I said, and his face lit up immediately. “But don’t tell your mom.",18,18
1py7w50,,"It’s a secret.”

He nodded eagerly as I handed him my pinky, sealing the pact like it was sacred.",19,19
1py7w50,,"I ran to the garage and rummaged around until I found two flashlights, a bolt cutter, and an old hard hat.",21,20
1py7w50,,"I gave the helmet to Hunter, and he proudly set it over his cap like it was armor.",18,21
1py7w50,,"At the time, I told myself this was about bonding, about making memories.",13,22
1py7w50,,"I’d missed most of his childhood because of work, and despite being older than my sister, life hadn’t blessed me with children of my own. It was a stupid decision.",30,23
1py7w50,,I know that now. We headed down the street toward the drain as dusk bled into night.,17,24
1py7w50,,"The last of the daylight vanished behind the hills, leaving the area bathed in the sickly yellow glow of aging streetlamps.",21,25
1py7w50,,"Hunter skipped beside me, already flicking his flashlight over every crack in the pavement, narrating his discoveries with excitement. I smiled, even as something tight coiled in my stomach.",29,26
1py7w50,,"The drain was blocked by a large wooden fence, mostly rotted through with age.",14,27
1py7w50,,I told Hunter to step back while I pried away a panel wide enough for us to slip through.,19,28
1py7w50,,"As soon as we did, the stench hit us — stale water, rust, and something sour beneath it.",18,29
1py7w50,,"“Pew!” Hunter exclaimed, and I laughed, though the smell clung to the back of my throat.",16,30
1py7w50,,Beyond that was a second barrier: a rusted metal fence bolted directly over the mouth of the drain.,18,31
1py7w50,,"Attached to it was a warning sign that had once been bright yellow, though now only a corner of paint remained.",21,32
1py7w50,,"The word DANGER was still embossed in the metal, visible when my flashlight passed over it. I should have listened.",20,33
1py7w50,,"While Hunter played with his light, I used the bolt cutter to carve out an opening.",16,34
1py7w50,,"The metal groaned and snapped louder than I liked, each sound echoing down into the darkness. Eventually, we squeezed through.",20,35
1py7w50,,"The moment I stepped inside, the hairs on the back of my neck stood up.",15,36
1py7w50,,"A strange buzzing filled my chest, like static just under my skin, and adrenaline flushed through me without reason.",19,37
1py7w50,,"“What is this place?” Hunter asked, his voice smaller now as he moved deeper into the tunnel. “It’s just an old drainage pipe,” I said, trying to sound casual.",29,38
1py7w50,,"“Pretty neat, right?”

He didn’t answer right away. Our footsteps echoed unnaturally, overlapping and stretching until it sounded like someone else was walking with us.",25,39
1py7w50,,"“I don’t know,” he finally said, his voice wavering. “It’s fine,” I replied, resting a hand on his shoulder. He yelped in surprise, dropping his flashlight.",26,40
1py7w50,,It clattered to the ground and went dark.,8,41
1py7w50,,"The sudden loss of light made the darkness feel thick, almost wet, as if it had weight to it, pressing against my eyes and skin.",25,42
1py7w50,,"For a heartbeat, I couldn’t move, my brain lagging behind the instinct to panic.",14,43
1py7w50,,"I dropped to one knee, fumbling blindly, my fingers brushing cold concrete before closing around the flashlight.",17,44
1py7w50,,"I smacked it once against my palm, then again, harder this time, the hollow sound echoing down the tunnel. Nothing.",20,45
1py7w50,,"A third smack finally coaxed it back to life, the beam sputtering weakly before stabilising. As the light returned, something deep within the tunnel shifted. It wasn’t loud.",28,46
1py7w50,,"It wasn’t even clear. Just a subtle displacement, like water disturbed far away, but it was enough to make my stomach clench.",22,47
1py7w50,,"My mouth went dry, the taste of metal and ash coating my tongue, and I realised I’d stopped breathing.",19,48
1py7w50,,"I forced air back into my lungs slowly, carefully, as if any sudden movement might draw attention.",17,49
1py7w50,,"“Maybe that’s enough adventure for today,” I said, my voice higher than I meant it to be as I handed the flashlight back to Hunter. He didn’t argue.",28,50
1py7w50,,"He didn’t joke. He just nodded, tight and quick, gripping the light with both hands like it was a lifeline.",20,51
1py7w50,,"For a few seconds, there was nothing but the drip of water and the echo of our breathing.",18,52
1py7w50,,"I started to convince myself it had been nothing, that fear had filled in the gaps where reason should have been. Then I heard it. Footsteps. Not a scuffle.",29,53
1py7w50,,"Not a scrape. Measured, deliberate steps echoing from deep within the tunnel, each one landing with enough weight to carry through the concrete.",23,54
1py7w50,,"They came slow at first, spaced far apart, like whatever was walking didn’t need to hurry. Every nerve in my body screamed at once. “Run outside. Now,” I shouted.",29,55
1py7w50,,"Hunter didn’t hesitate. His footsteps pounded away from me, frantic and uneven, shrinking rapidly as he fled toward the opening.",20,56
1py7w50,,"I swung the flashlight back into the darkness, the beam jittering as my hands shook. “Who’s there?” I called, my voice cracking despite my effort to steady it.",28,57
1py7w50,,"The light swept across bare walls, pooled water, rust-stained concrete. Nothing moved. No shape. No sound beyond the distant drip and the fading echo of my nephew’s escape.",28,58
1py7w50,,"I let out a shaky laugh, forcing air through clenched teeth. “You’re being stupid,” I muttered. “It’s just a rat.",20,59
1py7w50,,"Or pipes settling.”

I turned to call Hunter back, already rehearsing how I’d laugh this off later, when something landed beside me with a wet, meaty splash, like a heavy sack dropped into a shallow puddle.",36,60
1py7w50,,The sound was too close. I turned. The beam caught a face inches from mine.,15,61
1py7w50,,"Skin stretched grey and slick over bone, eyes sunken and bloodshot, reflecting the light like those of an animal caught in headlights.",22,62
1py7w50,,"Its mouth split into a grin far too wide, teeth blackened and broken, the stink of rot rolling off it in waves.",22,63
1py7w50,,"I tried to scream, but a hand closed around my throat before sound could escape, fingers digging in with impossible strength.",21,64
1py7w50,,"The world tilted as it shoved me back, my spine slamming into the damp wall hard enough to rattle my teeth. Air vanished from my lungs as the grip tightened.",30,65
1py7w50,,"From the corner of my eye, I saw the burlap sack resting against the tunnel floor.",16,66
1py7w50,,"The bottom of it was soaked dark, stiff with old stains that glistened wetly in the flashlight’s glow.",18,67
1py7w50,,"I thrashed uselessly, my hands clawing at its wrist, my boots scraping against the concrete for purchase.",17,68
1py7w50,,"It leaned closer, close enough that I could see the cracks in its skin, the filth caked into every fold.",20,69
1py7w50,,"The smell was overwhelming — decay, stagnant water, something sweet and sickly beneath it all.",15,70
1py7w50,,"It sniffed me once, then again, slow and deliberate, before dragging its tongue across my cheek. The touch was cold and slick. I gagged.",24,71
1py7w50,,"“Too ripe,” it gurgled, its voice bubbling like water forced through mud. The pressure vanished as suddenly as it had come.",21,72
1py7w50,,"I hit the ground hard, air crashing back into my lungs in a painful rush. I didn’t look back. I didn’t think. I ran.",24,73
1py7w50,,"I burst through the fence, grabbed Hunter, and didn’t stop until we were back at my parents’ house.",18,74

1pxya6p,Someone Turned My Campsite Into a Trap While I Slept.,I am writing this from a hospital waiting room with my hands wrapped like I tried to catch barbed wire on instinct.,22,0
1pxya6p,,I went camping last weekend at a state park outside my town. That is what the reservation email said. Loop C. I still have the receipt.,26,1
1pxya6p,,"It is smeared from rain and sweat, but I can read enough of it. State park. Camping fee, one night. Vehicle fee. Total thirty-five dollars.",25,2
1pxya6p,,A reservation ID that means nothing to anyone except me. I am not asking you to believe in the paranormal. Something mechanical happened to me out there.,27,3
1pxya6p,,"Something you can buy, carry in a tote, and switch on. I camp alone a lot. I do it the boring way. I tell my sister where I am.",29,4
1pxya6p,,I park nose-out. I lock food up. I do not hike off trail at night. I do not drink. I do not go looking for trouble.,26,5
1pxya6p,,This time I wanted one quiet night and a morning coffee that tastes like smoke. I got there around 4:40 p.m.,21,6
1pxya6p,,The ranger in the booth tore my printed slip and gave me the usual talk about quiet hours and not leaving coolers unattended.,23,7
1pxya6p,,The entrance sign had a changeable-letter board under it. Fire danger was moderate. No moving firewood. Quiet hours 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. The park was half full.,28,8
1pxya6p,,Families in big SUVs. A couple with a rooftop tent. A group of teenagers arguing over a Bluetooth speaker that kept cutting out when they walked too far from it.,30,9
1pxya6p,,"Loop C sat deeper in the pines. The road was dirt and washboarded. My spot was on the outer edge. Not the best view, but private. Picnic table. Fire ring.",30,10
1pxya6p,,"One of those steel bear boxes bolted into a slab of concrete, the kind that squeals when you open it. The first thing that felt off was the posts.",29,11
1pxya6p,,"There were four skinny fiberglass stakes around my site, about waist height, with bright orange reflective tape on the tops. Like survey markers.",23,12
1pxya6p,,"They were spaced in a loose square that did not match a normal campsite boundary. Each stake had a black zip tie near the top, cinched tight around nothing.",29,13
1pxya6p,,"I stood there longer than I want to admit, staring at them with my hands on my hips like that would solve anything. I told myself it was maintenance.",29,14
1pxya6p,,"Hazard tree marking. Utility work. Something. I set up my tent, a little two-person backpacking tent. I parked nose-out. I put my cooler in the bear box.",27,15
1pxya6p,,Here is the stupid human mistake I keep replaying. I did not latch the bear box the first time. I closed it. I heard the heavy door thunk.,28,16
1pxya6p,,I walked away thinking it was secure.,7,17
1pxya6p,,"Ten minutes later I walked back and realized the latch was still open by half an inch, the way it sits when you do not pull it down and lock it.",31,18
1pxya6p,,"I muttered at myself, fixed it, and moved on. Around 6:10 I walked to the restroom building to wash up.",20,19
1pxya6p,,"The building was painted that tired park-bathroom green, and it smelled like damp concrete and lemon cleaner that never quite wins.",21,20
1pxya6p,,On the way back I passed a bigger site where a dad was pounding stakes into the ground with the flat side of a hatchet.,25,21
1pxya6p,,He nodded at me and said the bugs were insane. I agreed even though I hadn’t noticed bugs yet.,19,22
1pxya6p,,"He looked past me toward my site and squinted like he was trying to read something in the dark. “What are those poles?” he asked. “Already here,” I said.",29,23
1pxya6p,,"“Probably maintenance.”

He made a face like he did not love that answer, then went back to his tent. I made a small fire. Not a big one.",28,24
1pxya6p,,Just enough to feel like I earned being outside.,9,25
1pxya6p,,"I ate a pouch dinner and sat on the bench with my headlamp around my neck, listening to the campground noise thin out. A baby cried somewhere down the loop.",30,26
1pxya6p,,Someone laughed too loud and got shushed. A car door slammed.,11,27
1pxya6p,,"Then it got quiet in that way campgrounds do, where you still hear people, but it comes in little distant pieces. At 9:58 my phone flipped from 5G to SOS.",30,28
1pxya6p,,I remember because I looked at it before crawling into my sleeping bag. I texted my sister “All good. Night.” It failed to send. Not surprising.,26,29
1pxya6p,,Lots of parks have dead spots. I fell asleep with my keys in my hand. That is another thing I normally never do.,23,30
1pxya6p,,I always put them in the same pocket.,8,31
1pxya6p,,"This time I was half asleep and I set them on the picnic table when I tightened my tent guylines, then forgot to pick them back up.",27,32
1pxya6p,,"I did not realize that until later, when it mattered. I slept for maybe two hours. I woke up because my tent moved. Not a gentle flutter of wind.",29,33
1pxya6p,,"A hard tug, like someone grabbed the rainfly and yanked. My first thought was an animal brushing past. Then the tent moved again, lower, like pressure at ankle height.",29,34
1pxya6p,,I sat up fast. My elbow hit the tent wall. My heart went straight to my throat. I listened. No footsteps. No snorting.,23,35
1pxya6p,,"Just a faint sound outside that didn’t belong. A tiny clicking, steady, like a cheap plastic pen being pressed over and over. Click. Click. Click.",25,36
1pxya6p,,"I found my headlamp and turned it on, pointing it at the tent wall. The nylon glowed. Shadows moved wrong.",20,37
1pxya6p,,"Thin lines crossed the fabric, not like branches, not like the normal wavering shapes you see when a light hits canvas.",21,38
1pxya6p,,I pushed the door zipper open just enough to look out. The beam hit the orange tape on the nearest stake and flashed bright.,24,39
1pxya6p,,"Behind it, in the dark, something caught the light in sharp little glints. Clear line. Fishing line. Monofilament. Dozens of strands stretched between the stakes.",25,40
1pxya6p,,"Some at shin height, some at waist height, some higher. A web that had not been there when I went to sleep. And it was moving. Not swaying. Pulling. Tightening.",30,41
1pxya6p,,The clicking got faster. A line snapped tight across the front of my tent door and the nylon creased around it like it was being cinched.,26,42
1pxya6p,,The tent shifted an inch. Then another. I crawled out on my hands and knees because standing felt like begging to get clotheslined.,23,43
1pxya6p,,"The headlamp made the lines sparkle for half a second, then they vanished again unless the beam hit them at the right angle. A line caught my wrist.",28,44
1pxya6p,,It did not wrap gently. It bit. Pain so clean it felt hot. It dug into skin like a wire saw.,21,45
1pxya6p,,"I yanked back on instinct and the line tightened, dragging my hand forward toward the nearest stake. My headlamp bounced.",20,46
1pxya6p,,"The beam flashed over the ground and I saw where the lines were anchored. Small black boxes at the base of trees, each about the size of a brick.",29,47
1pxya6p,,Each had a spool and a little metal wheel like a tiny winch. The clicking was coming from those boxes. They were pulling the line in.,26,48
1pxya6p,,A second line snapped up and caught two of my fingers together. My hand cramped instantly. I felt my pulse banging against plastic and pressure.,25,49
1pxya6p,,I went for my pocket knife. Got it open. Brought it down on the line at my wrist. It did not cut right away. The line stretched. The blade skated.,30,50
1pxya6p,,"Then it finally nicked through. The moment it broke, the free end snapped back and whipped my knuckles. I rolled, trying to get clear. A line tightened under my armpit.",30,51
1pxya6p,,Another caught my ankle and my foot slid toward the stake like the ground had turned slick. I started yelling. Loud. Ugly. I screamed for help until my throat burned.,30,52
1pxya6p,,"No one came running. Either nobody heard, or nobody wanted to charge into a campsite full of invisible line. Then I heard something new. Not clicking.",26,53
1pxya6p,,"A soft electronic chirp, like a key fob, followed by a longer tone. One of the winch boxes changed pitch.",20,54
1pxya6p,,It went from click to a smooth high whine for half a second. The line on my wrist tightened again and I understood what it was doing.,27,55
1pxya6p,,"This wasn’t just a web. It was a net that was closing around me. I crawled toward the nearest box, cutting lines as I went.",25,56
1pxya6p,,"Each cut line snapped back, stinging, sometimes catching my clothes. The knife handle got slick with blood. My wrist burned in a clean groove where the line had opened it.",30,57
1pxya6p,,"I reached the nearest box. It was strapped to the trunk with a ratchet strap. A thick battery pack sat beside it, wired in.",24,58
1pxya6p,,"On top was a small antenna, like a cheap handheld radio. The line ran through a metal guide and onto a spool.",22,59
1pxya6p,,I drove the knife down and cut as close to the spool as I could. The motor protested. The line went slack for a breath.,25,60
1pxya6p,,"Then the spool reversed and yanked the slack back. The line tightened around my calf again, harder, like the system corrected itself. Something in the trees flashed to my left.",30,61
1pxya6p,,"A red dot, low, moving. My headlamp caught a shape behind a trunk. Someone using the trees. Keeping distance. A hand raised.",22,62
1pxya6p,,"I saw the rectangle of a phone or a remote. The red dot moved again and settled on my torso, steady, like it was aimed on purpose.",27,63
1pxya6p,,My stomach turned cold. Not because of the dot. Because of what it meant. This was for me. I grabbed the battery cable and ripped it out of the box.,30,64
1pxya6p,,The clicking stopped. The line around my leg went slack so suddenly I almost fell backward.,16,65
1pxya6p,,For half a second it was quiet except for my breathing and the soft snap of the fire dying down in the ring. Then another clicking started farther away.,29,66
1pxya6p,,"Another box. Backup. The lines began tightening again, slower but still tightening. The person in the trees shifted. Leaves crushed under a careful step. I did not wait.",28,67
1pxya6p,,"I crawled out of the tightening net, cutting and dragging, getting snagged, freeing myself in inches. My shorts tore.",19,68
1pxya6p,,"My skin caught line and I felt it burn new grooves across my thigh and forearm. My headlamp bounced, turning the trees into quick flashes.",25,69
1pxya6p,,I got to my car and reached for my keys. Nothing. My pocket was empty.,15,70
1pxya6p,,"My brain did this blank, stupid pause, like it tried to deny reality for a second. Then it hit me. Picnic table. The clicking sped up again.",27,71
1pxya6p,,The net tightened again. I could feel it starting to catch my waist. I turned my headlamp toward the picnic table and saw them glinting there like a cruel joke.,30,72
1pxya6p,,"Right where I left them. I crawled to the table, grabbed them, and my wrist screamed when the line shifted against the cut.",23,73
1pxya6p,,"I got back to the car, hit unlock, and yanked the door open. A line snapped tight across my waist as I tried to get in.",26,74
1pxya6p,,It caught on my belt and pulled me back hard enough that my head clipped the door frame. I screamed and cut at it. The knife finally sliced through.,29,75
1pxya6p,,"The tension snapped back into the trees. I fell into the seat, slammed the door, and locked it. Lines slapped the outside of the car.",25,76
1pxya6p,,"I heard them ping against the metal like cables flicking a drum. In my headlight beam I saw the stakes again, and my stomach dropped even more.",27,77
1pxya6p,,"There were more than four. Extra stakes beyond the campsite boundary, closer to the road, hidden in brush. The web reached toward the road like it expected me to run.",30,78
1pxya6p,,"I started the car and threw it into reverse. The tires spun on dirt. The car lurched and I felt a jolt, like I hit something soft but strong.",29,79
1pxya6p,,"The hood dipped. The lines stretched. For a second I thought the car would be held in place. Then the lines snapped. The sound was sharp, multiplied. Whip cracks.",29,80
1pxya6p,,"The hood shook. Something slapped the windshield and left a wet streak. I reversed hard, then swung forward, aiming for the main road out of the loop.",27,81
1pxya6p,,"In my mirror, between trunks, I saw the person move. A silhouette, closer now. Reflective tape on their sleeves, orange like the stakes.",23,82
1pxya6p,,They stepped toward my car and raised a hand. Not waving. Pointing. My headlights swept the ground and for a second I saw what they’d been standing near.,28,83
1pxya6p,,"A plastic tote half buried in needles, lid cracked open, full of coiled clear line and more black boxes. Supplies. I hit the gas.",24,84
1pxya6p,,On the way out I laid on the horn until it sounded wrong. I wanted lights to come on. I wanted witnesses. Some did. Porch lights snapped on.,28,85
1pxya6p,,"A man stepped onto the road in socks, hands up like he did not know whether to stop me or ask what was wrong. I did not stop.",28,86
1pxya6p,,"I drove straight to the entrance booth. It was closed, dark, but there was an emergency phone box by the gate.",21,87
1pxya6p,,A small sign above it said to lift the receiver for emergencies and not to use it for reservations. My hands shook so badly I dropped the receiver once.,29,88
1pxya6p,,I told the dispatcher someone had set wire traps in my campsite and there were motors pulling them tight.,19,89
1pxya6p,,I kept saying “wire” because “fishing line” sounded too stupid for what it had done. A sheriff’s deputy arrived first. Then a ranger in a separate vehicle.,27,90
1pxya6p,,They took one look at my wrists and legs and told me to sit. They drove back to Loop C with lights on. I didn’t go with them.,28,91
1pxya6p,,I couldn’t make myself. I sat under a buzzing light and watched moths slam into the plastic cover while my blood dripped onto the concrete.,25,92
1pxya6p,,"I remember thinking, very clearly, that the drip was too slow to be real, like my brain was watching it in someone else’s body.",24,93
1pxya6p,,"When the ranger came back his face looked different, like he’d aged ten years on the drive. He did not tell me it was nothing.",25,94
1pxya6p,,"He did not tell me I imagined it. He said, “We found it.”

They found the stakes. They found the lines.",21,95
1pxya6p,,"They found multiple winch boxes still strapped to trees, still working, still pulling line even after I’d ripped one battery loose. They found the tote.",25,96
1pxya6p,,They did not find the person. At the hospital they irrigated the cuts. They picked clear fragments out of my skin with tweezers. They gave me a tetanus shot.,29,97
1pxya6p,,The doctor asked if I’d been attacked. I told him yes. He asked by what.,15,98
1pxya6p,,"I told him, “A system.”

Two days later I drove past that state park on my way to work just to prove to myself it existed.",26,99
1pxya6p,,The sign is still there. The entrance still looks friendly. The little tourist board still advertises it like a peaceful place to unwind. Loop C is closed now.,28,100
1pxya6p,,"There is new signage zip-tied to the permanent posts. Bright yellow, temporary. It says the area is closed due to utility work and not to enter Loop C.",28,101
1pxya6p,,"If I ever camp again and see skinny fiberglass stakes with reflective tape that do not make sense, or zip ties around nothing, I won’t assume it is maintenance.",29,102
1pxya6p,,"I won’t sleep in that site. I won’t step between those posts. And if I hear clicking in the dark that doesn’t sound like an animal, I’m leaving.",28,103
1pxya6p,,"I’m doing it before the lines start moving. Because once they start pulling, you stop being a camper. You become a problem somebody planned to solve.",26,104

1pxwu8j,,"The drive was long, and made even longer by the fact that my husband was a constant fidgeter - always tapping his fingers, jiggling his leg, combing his fingers through his hair, and otherwise shifting about.",36,2
1pxwu8j,,"Truthfully, I’d never even considered camping before. My parents didn’t believe in it.",13,3
1pxwu8j,,"They’d grown up poor, and sleeping in the open air with no plumbing or electricity was too close to their own childhoods.",22,4
1pxwu8j,,"When I told my Mom about our upcoming trip, she shook her head derisively.",14,5
1pxwu8j,,"But when I told her exactly where we were going, she gasped, her eyes wide, and whispered, as if reciting from memory, “In the mountains older than bones, strange things hunger for them.”

“Wait here,” she urged, before going upstairs.",40,6
1pxwu8j,,"When she returned, she pressed a necklace into my palm - my grandmother’s amethyst pendant. She held my hand in both of hers, and squeezed them before continuing.",28,7
1pxwu8j,,"“When your father and I left the woods, it wasn’t just because we were poor...”

I made a noncommittal hum of acknowledgement and pulled my hand away to inspect the jewel, only half-listening.",33,8
1pxwu8j,,"“There’s things in the forest we wanted to protect you from…” She gripped my forearm painfully tight to get my attention, and I startled. “Listen to me.",27,9
1pxwu8j,,"I don’t want you to go, but if you do, once the sun sets, don’t talk to anybody you hadn’t set eyes on before nightfall.”

My Mom’s stare was intense, her voice tight as she kept going, “I don’t care if you hear someone screaming for help.",47,10
1pxwu8j,,I don’t care if someone you think you know walks up.,11,11

And then I did the most normal thing in the world - I laughed it off.",29,12

We made it to the woods without a problem.",28,13

1pxwu8j,,"I’d pledged not to grumble or complain on the trip, and it truly was pleasant while we hiked to the campground.",21,15

1pxwu8j,,"“It just got really cold,” he said. “Yeah,” I agreed. There was a loud crack in the woods, like a tree branch snapping, behind us and we spun around.",29,18
1pxwu8j,,"Then one in front. Then two to either side. We were surrounded but couldn’t see anyone. There was a rustle, a susurration of whispers, voice-like, but indecipherable.",27,19
1pxwu8j,,“Hell-“ my husband started to call. “Shhh!” I hissed at him.,11,20
1pxwu8j,,"He looked at me in confusion, but I just knew, deep down in my bones, that talking to whatever was out there would be seen as an invitation.",28,21

“Bone…”

1pxixtt,,So I get that batch going and try to wipe everything clean but the powder just kind of transfers to my gloves so I keep having to change them.,29,59

1pxixtt,,"Ok, it’s hot, so I start chugging my water and get back to work. Across the plaza, I hear a rattling scream. Then another, another, and another.",27,63
1pxixtt,,"When I look up, there’s several small pockets of people on their knees, screaming and collapsing to the ground, frothing at the mouth or gawking at the heavens above.",29,64
1pxixtt,,"Their friends watch in horror as they writhe around. I glance over at Cami, and she’s on her knees, her face raised to the sky, just like everyone else.",29,65

1pxixtt,,"I drop down just like everyone else, staring up to what should be clouds, but instead is the greasy ceiling of my booth.",23,67
1pxixtt,,"Cami starts to shriek, joining the horrid harmony of the poor other souls.",13,68
1pxixtt,,"Being on the floor, I can’t exactly see anything even if my legs would move but I feel like I can hear everything around me.",25,69
1pxixtt,,The screaming starts to turn into a droning hum as people congregate in the center of the plaza around the big statue.,22,70
1pxixtt,,They sort of congeal around it and their sound begins to change from that communal drone to speaking in tongues and begging for redemption.,24,71
1pxixtt,,"My legs start to twitch under me, as if they have a mind of their own. I start to stand, being pulled to the statue myself.",26,72
1pxixtt,,"As I approach it, I feel the air vibrate, pulling me closer to it, until I’m trying to push myself through the masses at the marble base to touch it and praise her.",33,73
1pxixtt,,"Cami is on my left, a shambling mess covered in…. Soot? Why does she have soot bleeding out of her nose? They all do.",24,74
1pxixtt,,I jerk my head down to see the front of my shirt covered in soot and ash. *We* all do.,20,75

1pxixtt,,"I didn’t know the statue was a woman, but *she* felt like a benevolent soul I must appease.",18,77
1pxixtt,,"The tone of our congregation suddenly shifts, and people are pulling each other out of the way, trying to touch it.",21,78
1pxixtt,,I watch my own hands grab the collar of the woman in front of me and pull her to the ground. She sells earrings a few booths from Karen.,29,79
1pxixtt,,"I quickly take her spot, leaving her lying on the ground in this undulating mass of limbs and soot.",19,80
1pxixtt,,Someone pushes up behind me and I hear a sharp crack before the woman releases a feral scream that quickly peters out. *We* don’t care.,25,81
1pxixtt,,No one stops to help her. We’re fighting for the right to touch the base of this weird statue.,19,82
1pxixtt,,"As soon as my fingers graced the marble base, a surge of power that felt ancient and earthy launched up my arms and sends me into a frenzy.",28,83
1pxixtt,,"I clammer back into the crowd, letting the people behind us get a taste if they can manage to stay upright. If they fall, they’re underfoot and probably stepped on.",30,84
1pxixtt,,"With no control over my body, I rush for the nearest structure and begin to claw at the siding, trying to tear it apart with my bare hands.",28,85
1pxixtt,,I think it was an enclosed gazebo where teenagers hid in to smoke pot at night.,16,86
1pxixtt,,The wood planks had that plant smoke smell embedded in them and it felt like an offense to *her*.,19,87
1pxixtt,,I don’t even know who *she* is but I needed to please her.,13,88
1pxixtt,,"I keep tearing at the boards until something becomes loose and falls to the ground then I move to the next one, this dryadic power telling me to destroy the structure because it’s an offense to *her* and what she’s provided for the town.",44,89

1pxixtt,,"My body begins to grow heavy and slow at this point, and I think I blacked out. When I came around again, it was dark outside.",26,91
1pxixtt,,"The streetlights had come on, and the entire plaza was absolutely destroyed except the statue.",15,92
1pxixtt,,"Booths and tables had been flipped, the gazebo was missing boards and covered in dark wet streaks.",17,93
1pxixtt,,"Something had been on fire at one point, but now it was just a pile of smoldering ashes, the smoke hanging in the air.",24,94
1pxixtt,,"Hopefully unconscious bodies are scattered around, some twitching a little and some totally still.",14,95
1pxixtt,,"The woman I had pulled down is still in a crumpled pile at the base of the statue, and I couldn’t bring myself to go see if she’d alive or not.",31,96
1pxixtt,,I pushed myself to my feet again and try to stay upright but my entire body feels like it’s on fire.,21,97
1pxixtt,,"My fingertips feel raw, I’m down at least one finger nail and maybe a few fingerprints entirely.",17,98
1pxixtt,,"I all but crawl to my car and climb in, patting around for my keys. Despite the utter chaos of the day, my keys never fell off my belt.",29,99
1pxixtt,,"This is why we have carabiners people. I crept home, grossly under the speed limit until I pulled into the back of the shop.",24,100

[Part 2](

Something about the way my mom had been acting didn’t sit right with me. It wasn’t just what she said. It was what she didn’t.",29,0
1pxf2c5,,The way she went still whenever my father was mentioned. The way she answered questions with reassurance instead of details.,20,1
1pxf2c5,,The way she kept trying to move past things like they were already settled. The mention of my father had felt like flipping a switch I didn’t know existed.,29,2
1pxf2c5,,Her reaction wasn’t confusion or grief. It was shock. Sharp and immediate. Like I’d stumbled into something she’d spent years making sure stayed buried.,24,3
1pxf2c5,,I tried to tell myself I was overthinking it. I’d been doing a lot of that lately. Every shadow felt longer. Every sound felt intentional.,25,4
1pxf2c5,,"I was bouncing between hotels, keeping my head down, trying to blend into the background like that would somehow make me harder to find.",24,5
1pxf2c5,,But I couldn’t shake the feeling that it didn’t matter. That he was still watching. Not following. Not chasing. Just… observing. Patient. The way he always had been.,28,6
1pxf2c5,,"The longer I sat with it, the more obvious it became that there was a piece of this I didn’t have.",21,7
1pxf2c5,,Something that explained why the cards started when they did. Why they never stopped. Why my mom reacted the way she had all those years ago and again now.,29,8
1pxf2c5,,I knew she had answers I didn’t. And I knew she wasn’t going to volunteer them.,16,9
1pxf2c5,,"After a few days of minimal contact with anyone in my life, no visits, no explanations, just short texts so people knew I was still breathing. I finally called her.",30,10
1pxf2c5,,She answered on the second ring. “Are you okay?” she asked immediately. I almost said yes out of habit.,19,11
1pxf2c5,,"Instead, I said, “I need to talk to you again.”

There was a pause on the other end of the line. Not long. Just long enough to feel deliberate.",29,12
1pxf2c5,,“About what?” she asked. “You know what” I said. Another pause.,11,13
1pxf2c5,,"Then she said, “Come over.”

I arrived at my mom’s house and before I could knock, she was already opening the door. She looked tired. Not sleepy. Worn down.",29,14
1pxf2c5,,Like someone who’d been bracing for something. She stepped aside without saying anything. I walked straight to the dining room table and sat down.,24,15
1pxf2c5,,Same chair I’d sat in a thousand times growing up. Same view of the kitchen doorway. She didn’t sit right away.,21,16
1pxf2c5,,"She hovered near the counter, hands resting on the edge like she needed something solid to hold onto. “Mom” I said.",21,17
1pxf2c5,,"“What the hell is going on?”

She closed her eyes for a second. “Am I missing a piece here?” I asked. “Do you know something?”

“It’s complicated” she said.",29,18
1pxf2c5,,"“That’s not an answer” I said. “Not anymore.”

She finally sat across from me. Folded her hands. Unfolded them. Folded them again. “You spoke about your father” she said carefully.",30,19
1pxf2c5,,"“That day. You caught me off guard.”

“You didn’t look surprised” I said. “You looked scared.”

Her jaw tightened. “He wasn’t a good man” she said. I waited.",28,20
1pxf2c5,,"She glanced toward the hallway, like she expected someone else to be standing there listening. Then she looked back at me. “He wasn’t always bad” she said.",27,21
1pxf2c5,,“But he wasn’t safe. Not for me. Not for you.” There were nights I slept with you in my arms on the couch” she continued. “Because it was quieter there.,30,22
1pxf2c5,,"Easier to hear him coming.”

My stomach twisted. “I called the police” she said. “More than once.",17,23
1pxf2c5,,"You were still a baby.”

That was the first thing she said that felt like a crack instead of a shield. “They came every time?” I asked. She nodded.",29,24
1pxf2c5,,"“Usually the same officer” she said. “I didn’t ask for that. It just… happened that way.”

I leaned forward. “What officer.”

She hesitated. “He was always calm” she said instead.",30,25
1pxf2c5,,“He talked to your father outside. Told him to cool off. Told him to go for a drive.,18,26
1pxf2c5,,"And he always did.”

She paused, then added quietly, “That scared me too.”

“Why?” I asked. “Because your father didn’t listen to anyone” she said.",25,27
1pxf2c5,,"“Except him.”

I didn’t like where this was going.",9,28
1pxf2c5,,"“One night” she continued, “after he’d left, the officer stayed longer than he was supposed to.”

I looked down without meaning to.",22,29
1pxf2c5,,"“He told me I didn’t deserve to live like that” she said. “That my baby didn’t deserve it either.”

My hands clenched. “He gave me his card” she said.",29,30
1pxf2c5,,"“Not the department one. His personal number. He told me to call if I ever needed anything. Even if I was scared and didn’t know why yet.”

I swallowed.",29,31
1pxf2c5,,“And you did” I said. She nodded. “At first it was just… reassurance” she said. “He’d check in. Sometimes he’d stop by without being dispatched.,25,32
1pxf2c5,,"Just to make sure we were okay.”

Her voice got quieter. “Then I started seeing him places” she said. “The grocery store. The gas station. The bank.”

My chest tightened.",30,33
1pxf2c5,,"“You thought it was a coincidence?” I said. “I wanted it to be” she said. She rubbed her hands together, like she was cold.",24,34
1pxf2c5,,“Then there was a night your father left drunk.” she said. “He said things he couldn’t take back. I didn’t know if he’d come back angrier or not at all.,30,35
1pxf2c5,,"I was scared.”

She looked at me then. Really looked at me. “I called the police.” she said. “I didn’t even finish explaining.",23,36
1pxf2c5,,"And he showed up.”

The room felt smaller. “He told me to lock the doors.” she said.",17,37
1pxf2c5,,"“He told me he’d find him before he came back.”

My heart started pounding. “And?” I asked. She didn’t answer right away. “He came back later” she said finally.",29,38
1pxf2c5,,"“Not your father. The officer.”

I held my breath. “He told me there’d been an accident” she said. “Single car. Lost control. Died on impact.”

I stared at her.",29,39
1pxf2c5,,"“That’s what the report said” she added quickly. “That’s what everyone said.”

My ears were ringing. “You never questioned it?” I said. She looked away. “I was relieved.” she said.",30,40
1pxf2c5,,"“And ashamed of being relieved.”

The silence stretched. Then I asked the question I hadn’t wanted to ask since the beginning. “Mom” I said, my voice barely steady.",28,41
1pxf2c5,,"“When did the cards start?”

She didn’t answer. “Mom” I said again. “When.”

Her eyes filled, but she didn’t cry. “A few months later, on your birthday” she said.",29,42
1pxf2c5,,The room felt like it tilted. “And you didn’t stop them?” I said. “I thought they were from family at first. Your grandmother or a distant relative.” she whispered.,29,43
1pxf2c5,,I didn’t put it together until I got the next few. I thought he was just… checking in. Making sure you were okay.,23,44
1pxf2c5,,"Making sure we were okay.”

I stood up. “Did you ever tell him to stop?” I asked. She hesitated. That was enough. I stayed standing. “After that night” I said.",30,45
1pxf2c5,,"“After the cards started. Did you ever speak to him again?”

My mom looked confused. “No” she said. “Why would I?”

“When you went to the police” I said.",29,46
1pxf2c5,,"“Did you actually go or did you go to him.”

“That was the only time” she said. “I didn’t file a report. I asked to speak with him directly.",29,47
1pxf2c5,,"I told him the cards needed to stop.”

“He told me they were harmless” she said.",16,48
1pxf2c5,,"“That he was just checking in.“

She hesitated, then added, “And for a long time, he was telling the truth.”

I thought about all those quiet years. The simple cards.",30,49
1pxf2c5,,"No messages. No escalation. Just presence. “He told me families look different sometimes” she said. “That people watch out for each other in their own ways.”

My throat felt tight.",30,50
1pxf2c5,,"“He promised he’d never cross a line” she said. “He said he understood boundaries.”

“And you believed him.”

I looked around the room.",23,51
1pxf2c5,,At the same walls that had watched me grow up. At the table where I’d eaten breakfast before school. At the place that was supposed to be safe.,28,52
1pxf2c5,,“When did you stop believing him?” I asked. She didn’t answer right away. “When you called me about the deliverers” she said finally. That landed harder than I expected.,29,53
1pxf2c5,,"“I thought it was just birthdays” she said. “I thought it was nostalgia. A reminder. I didn’t think it was… active.”

Active. I nodded slowly. That was when it clicked.",30,54
1pxf2c5,,Not all at once. Not like a revelation in a movie. Just a quiet alignment of things that suddenly made sense. The timing. The shift from cards to gifts.,29,55
1pxf2c5,,The way everything escalated after I stopped being alone. After she moved in. I didn’t say it out loud. I didn’t need to.,23,56
1pxf2c5,,"“You didn’t do anything wrong” she said quickly. “You were a child. I was scared. He helped us when no one else did.”

That didn’t make this okay.",28,57
1pxf2c5,,"My phone buzzed in my pocket. I froze. So did she. I pulled it out slowly, already knowing what it would be. No call. No text. Just a notification.",29,58
1pxf2c5,,"Motion detected. I tapped it. There she was. My girlfriend, standing on my front step, slipping her key into the lock like it was any other day.",27,59
1pxf2c5,,Like nothing was wrong. My heart slammed into my ribs. My mom’s face drained of color. My phone rang. It was my girlfriend. I answered immediately.,26,60
1pxf2c5,,"“What are you doing at the house?” I said. “What?” she asked. “You told me to come.”

“No, I didn’t” I said. “I’m at my mom’s.",26,61
1pxf2c5,,"I never told you to go there.”

There was a pause on the line. “I got a text from you” she said. “You said you needed me.",27,62
1pxf2c5,,"You said it was important.”

My stomach dropped. “That wasn’t me” I said. “Listen to me. You need to leave. Right now.",22,63
1pxf2c5,,"Call the police.”

“I don’t understand” my girlfriend said. “You’re freaking me out.”

“Listen to me” I said. “I need you to leave the house.",25,64
1pxf2c5,,"Right now.”

There was a pause. My mom was shaking beside me, whispering my name over and over like she could pull me back from something just by saying it.",30,65
1pxf2c5,,"“Just trust me” I said. “Please. Get out. Go back to your car.”

I heard her move the phone away from her ear. “Hold on” she said.",27,66
1pxf2c5,,"“Someone’s knocking.”

My heart dropped. I heard her footsteps. The soft sound of her moving across the living room. Then the faint creak of the floor near the front window.",30,67
1pxf2c5,,"She went quiet. “It’s the police” she said, her voice already lighter. Relieved. “There’s a cop outside.”

I felt sick. “Do not open that door” I said.",27,68
1pxf2c5,,"“I’m serious.”

I didn’t speak fast enough. I heard the deadbolt slide. The door opened. “Hi” she said. “Can I help you?”

Her voice sounded normal. Polite. Calm.",28,69
1pxf2c5,,"I could hear a man speak through the phone now. Close. Clear. “Evening, ma’am” he said. “Sorry to bother you.",20,70
1pxf2c5,,"We got a call about a possible disturbance in the area. Just doing a quick welfare check.”

My mom covered her mouth. “That’s weird” my girlfriend said.",27,71
1pxf2c5,,"“Everything’s fine.”

“Yeah” the man said. “That’s usually the case. Mind if I ask you a couple questions?”

“Tell him to leave” I said. “Right now.”

She didn’t hear me.",30,72
1pxf2c5,,"“No problem” she said. There was a brief pause. Not silence. Consideration. “And you’re here alone?”

“Yes” she said.",19,73
1pxf2c5,,"“Well, I mean, I was just on the phone with my boyfriend.”

“That’s okay” he said easily. “You can keep talking.",21,74
1pxf2c5,,"I don’t want to interrupt.”

I recognized the cadence immediately. Not the words. The rhythm. The way he placed his pauses.",21,75
1pxf2c5,,The way he sounded like someone who was used to people listening. “Could you step back inside for me?” he said. “I don’t like standing in doorways.,27,76
1pxf2c5,,"Safety thing.”

I felt my vision tunnel. “Don’t” I said to myself. “Please. Don’t move.”

She hesitated. “Is something wrong?” she asked him. “No” he said.",26,77
1pxf2c5,,"“Everything’s fine.”

She stepped back. The door closed. I heard the lock turn. I heard footsteps now. Heavy. Controlled. Then his voice again. Closer to the phone.",27,78
1pxf2c5,,"“You have a nice place” he said. “You take good care of him.”

“What?” she asked, confused. “I’ve been watching him grow up” the man said.",26,79
1pxf2c5,,"“Longer than you’ve known him.”

My mouth went dry. There was a pause. Then my girlfriend laughed nervously. “I think you have the wrong…”

There was silence.",27,80
1pxf2c5,,"Then the man spoke again, softer this time. I couldn’t hear what was being said. Then the line went dead. I didn’t hang up right away.",26,81
1pxf2c5,,"I stood there with my phone pressed to my ear, listening to nothing, like the silence might change if I waited long enough.",23,82
1pxf2c5,,Then my body caught up to my brain. I grabbed my keys and was out the door before my mom could say my name. My phone rang halfway there.,29,83
1pxf2c5,,"It was her. I answered immediately. “Are you okay?” I said. “Where are you?”

“I left” she said quickly.",19,84
1pxf2c5,,"“I’m not at the house anymore.”

The relief hit so hard my vision blurred. “He told me to go” she continued. “The officer. He said he was a family friend.",30,85
1pxf2c5,,"He said he’d heard about what’s been going on and thought it would be best if I stayed somewhere else tonight.”

My stomach tightened.",24,86
1pxf2c5,,"“He said he was glad everyone was safe” she said. “He told me not to worry.”

I swallowed. “That wasn’t just a police officer” I said. There was a pause.",30,87
1pxf2c5,,"“What?”

“That wasn’t who he said he was” I said. “Listen to me. I need you to go home. Not my place. Yours. Lock the doors.",26,88
1pxf2c5,,"Call the police and tell them everything. Every detail.”

“You’re scaring me” she said. “I know” I said. “I’m sorry.“ I gave her the quickest explanation I could.",28,89
1pxf2c5,,She seemed distraught but she understood now. We hung up. My phone rang again almost immediately. Unknown number. I stared at it until it stopped ringing. Then it rang again.,30,90
1pxf2c5,,I answered. His voice was calm. Almost pleasant. “You should be grateful” he continued.,14,91
1pxf2c5,,"“I didn’t have to let her leave.”

My heart was pounding so hard I could hear it in my ears. “She could’ve had an accident” he said.",27,92
1pxf2c5,,"“People do all the time. Especially when they’re scared.”

I couldn’t form words. My mind was moving too fast. “I just want to celebrate” he said.",26,93
1pxf2c5,,"“That’s all this was ever supposed to be.”

I didn’t respond. “The house where you grew up” he said. “The first place you ever got a card.",27,94
1pxf2c5,,"You remember where it is?”

I did. “It’s empty now” he said. “I’ve been fixing it up. I thought it would be nice. Just us.",25,95
1pxf2c5,,"Like family.”

I told him to fuck off. He laughed softly. “You don’t have a choice” he said. “If you don’t show up, I’ll make some phone calls.",28,96
1pxf2c5,,"I’ll find evidence that your mother wasn’t as innocent as everyone thinks.”

My grip tightened on the phone.",18,97
1pxf2c5,,"“And if that doesn’t work” he added, “I know exactly where your girlfriend’s parents live.”

He recited the address without hesitation. Perfectly. “I’ll see you soon” he said.",28,98
1pxf2c5,,"“I’m sure you are already on your way.”

The call ended. I pulled the car over and sat there for a long time, staring at nothing. Then I turned around.",30,99
1pxf2c5,,"I’m posting this now because it’s the last moment I have to do it on my own terms. If I don’t come back, at least someone will know why.",29,100

1. Do not leave the lobby between 9:00 p.m. and 5:00 a.m. 2.",27,8
1pxeqog,,"If you hear footsteps, do not look toward the sound. 3. If an alarm sounds, wait for instructions. 4. If someone asks you to let them out, do not respond.",30,9
1pxeqog,,"5. If you see yourself on the cameras, log the time and look away. I laughed at that last one. The first few nights were quiet, too quiet.",28,10
1pxeqog,,"No deliveries, no staff, no cleaning crews. The cameras showed hallways, stairwells, and rooms full of shelves covered in white sheets. At 9:07 p.m.",24,11
1pxeqog,,"on my fourth night, I heard footsteps, they came from behind me. Slow, bare, careful.",15,12
1pxeqog,,"I remembered rule number 2 and stared straight ahead, forcing my eyes to stay on the monitors. The sound stopped directly behind my chair.",24,13
1pxeqog,,"I felt breath against my neck, cold, dry, patient. A whisper followed. “You missed a spot.” I didn’t move. After a long moment, the pressure behind me vanished.",28,14
1pxeqog,,"The footsteps resumed, fading down a hallway I knew didn’t connect to the lobby. At 11:30 p.m., an alarm went off.",21,15
1pxeqog,,"Camera 14, the screen showed a door I hadn’t noticed before, thick metal, covered in warning labels I couldn’t quite read. Someone stood on the other side, pounding softly, rhythmically.",30,16
1pxeqog,,"Not panicked, polite. The intercom crackled. “Do not approach,” my supervisor said calmly. “Log it.” The pounding stopped. The person leaned close to the camera, it was me.",28,17
1pxeqog,,"Same uniform, same tired expression, same scar on my chin. “I’ve been here too long,” he said through the speakers.",20,18
1pxeqog,,"“Please, just open it.”

My hands shook as I typed the timestamp into the log. “Good,” my supervisor said.",19,19
1pxeqog,,"“You’re learning.”

At 2:12 a.m., someone knocked on the lobby door, three slow taps. I didn’t turn around, the knocking came again. “Security?” a woman’s voice called.",27,20
1pxeqog,,"“They said you’d help.”

I stayed still, her voice dropped to a whisper. “I can hear you breathing.”

The cameras flickered.",21,21
1pxeqog,,"For half a second, every screen showed the same image: the lobby, empty, except for my chair. Facing the desk, no one sitting in it.",25,22
1pxeqog,,"I stood up so fast the chair clattered to the floor, the screens snapped back to normal. My supervisor appeared again, smiling wider than before.",25,23
1pxeqog,,"“You’ve reached the end of your shift,” he said. “Congratulations.”

“What is this place?” I asked. “A holding company,” he replied.",21,24
1pxeqog,,"“We secure what can’t leave yet.” The door unlocked behind me. When I stepped outside, the building was gone. Just an empty lot, chain-link fence, overgrown weeds.",27,25
1pxeqog,,My phone buzzed with a final email: “Thank you for your service. Your replacement has arrived.” Attached was a photo from Camera 1.,23,26
1pxeqog,,"The lobby desk, the chair, and someone sitting in it. Watching the monitors, wearing my uniform, looking very tired. I never went back.",23,27
1pxeqog,,"But sometimes, late at night, when I close my eyes, I swear I hear footsteps behind me, slow, careful, waiting for me to turn around.",25,28
1px7en8,"I wanted to reconnect with my son, so I took him to my father’s old hunting grounds. I think someone else connected with him instead.",It started with good intentions. That’s the sick joke of it all. My son is sixteen.,16,0
1px7en8,,"And if you have a sixteen-year-old, you know what I mean when I say he’s a stranger living in my house.",21,1
1px7en8,,"He exists in a self-contained universe of glowing screens, muffled bass from his headphones, and monosyllabic grunts that pass for communication. We used to be close.",26,2
1px7en8,,"When he was little, he was my shadow. Now, I’m just the guy who pays for the Wi-Fi.",18,3
1px7en8,,"The distance between us had become a canyon, and I was terrified that one day I’d look across and not be able to see the other side at all.",29,4
1px7en8,,"I had to do something. So I fell back on the only thing I knew, the only real template for fatherhood I ever had.",24,5
1px7en8,,"My own father was a grim man. Not cruel, not abusive, just… silent.",13,6
1px7en8,,"He was a block of granite, weathered and hard, and you could spend a lifetime chipping away and never find the core of him.",24,7
1px7en8,,"He worked a hard-labor job, came home, ate his dinner while staring at the wall, and spent his weekends either fixing things in the garage or just sitting on the porch.",31,8
1px7en8,,"The only time he ever seemed to unthaw, the only time I felt anything like a connection, was when he took me hunting.",23,9
1px7en8,,"He’d take me to a vast, sprawling state forest a few hours from our house. We’d walk for miles, not really hunting anything specific, just walking.",26,10
1px7en8,,"He’d point out tracks, identify bird calls, show me which mushrooms would kill you and which you could eat.",19,11
1px7en8,,He spoke more in those woods in a single weekend than he would in a month at home. It was our place. His church. He’s gone now.,27,12
1px7en8,,"Been gone twenty years. I’ll get to that. So, I decided to take my son to the same woods. I pitched it as a ""digital detox"" camping and hunting trip.",30,13
1px7en8,,"He complained, of course. A weekend without signal was, to him, a fate worse than death.",16,14
1px7en8,,"But I bribed him with a new, expensive hunting knife he’d been wanting, and with a weary sigh, he agreed. The first day was… okay. Awkward.",26,15
1px7en8,,The silence in the car was heavy.,7,16
1px7en8,,"When we got there and started hiking in, he kept pulling out his phone, trying to find a bar of service, his face a mask of frustration.",27,17
1px7en8,,"I just kept walking, trying to channel my old man’s patience. ""Look,"" I said, pointing. ""Deer tracks.",17,18
1px7en8,,"A doe and a fawn, see how small the second set is?""

He glanced, gave a noncommittal ""huh,"" and went back to his phone. My heart sank.",27,19
1px7en8,,"This was a mistake. I was trying to force a memory that wasn’t his, trying to fit him into a mold my own father had made for me.",28,20
1px7en8,,"But then, a few hours in, something shifted. The deeper we got, the more the silence of the woods seemed to swallow the silence between us.",26,21
1px7en8,,"His phone was useless, a dead brick in his pocket. He finally put it away. He started to look around.",20,22
1px7en8,,"He asked me what kind of tree a particularly massive, gnarled oak was. He asked if there were bears out here. We talked. Actually talked.",25,23
1px7en8,,"About school, about some girl he liked, about the stupid video games he played. It was stilted and clumsy, but it was a conversation, a start even.",27,24
1px7en8,,"A fragile bridge across the canyon. By late afternoon, we were miles from any marked trail. This was how my father did it.",23,25
1px7en8,,"He believed the real woods didn't start until you couldn't hear the highway anymore. The air grew cooler, thick with the smell of damp earth and decaying leaves.",28,26
1px7en8,,"The sunlight, filtered through the dense canopy, painted the forest floor in shifting patterns of green and gold. It was beautiful. Peaceful.",22,27
1px7en8,,"I felt the tension in my shoulders, a knot I hadn't realized I’d been carrying for years, finally begin to loosen. My son seemed to feel it too.",28,28
1px7en8,,"He was walking with a lighter step, his head up, taking it all in. ""It's... pretty quiet out here,"" he said as an observation. ""It is,"" I replied, smiling.",29,29
1px7en8,,"""It's the kind of quiet that's full of sound, if you listen.""

We were walking through a part of the forest I’d never been to, even with my father.",29,30
1px7en8,,"The trees were older here, thicker. Their branches were heavy with moss that hung down like old men’s beards. The ground was a spongy carpet of fallen needles.",28,31
1px7en8,,"It felt ancient, untouched. That’s when he saw it. ""Dad, what the hell is that?""

He was pointing off to our left, maybe fifty yards into a thicket of ferns.",30,32
1px7en8,,"I followed his gaze, and my breath caught in my throat. Hanging from the thick, low-slung branch of a colossal pine was… a thing. It’s hard to describe.",28,33
1px7en8,,"At first glance, it looked like a massive, oversized cocoon or hornet’s nest. It was roughly human-sized, maybe a little over six feet long, and hung vertically.",27,34
1px7en8,,But it wasn't made of paper or silk. It seemed to be woven from the forest itself.,17,35
1px7en8,,"Moss, pine needles, strips of bark, and thick, fibrous vines were all matted together with some kind of dark, hardened secretion that looked like dried sap.",26,36
1px7en8,,"It was a grotesque parody of a chrysalis, a lumpy, organic pod that was a deep, sickly green-brown, perfectly camouflaged against the tree trunk behind it. It just… felt wrong.",30,37
1px7en8,,"Deeply, fundamentally wrong. A primal alarm bell went off in the deepest part of my brain.",16,38
1px7en8,,"The kind of instinct that kept our ancestors alive when they heard a rustle in the tall grass. ""Don't,"" I said, my voice low and urgent.",26,39
1px7en8,,"""Stay here.""

But he's sixteen. ""Don't"" is an invitation. He was already pushing through the ferns, his earlier apathy replaced by a morbid, fearless curiosity.",25,40
1px7en8,,"""No, seriously,"" I snapped, harsher this time. ""Get back here. Now.""

""Just want to see what it is,"" he called back, not even looking at me.",26,41
1px7en8,,"""It's weird.""

I hurried after him, my heart hammering against my ribs. ""We don't know what it is. It could be a nest for something dangerous.",26,42
1px7en8,,"Back away from it.""

He was standing right in front of it now, looking up. From up close, it was even worse.",22,43
1px7en8,,"You could see the intricate weaving of the fibers, the way small twigs and dead leaves were incorporated into its structure.",21,44
1px7en8,,"It swayed ever so slightly in the breeze, a silent, monstrous pendulum. There was a faint, cloying smell coming from it, like rotting mushrooms and wet soil.",27,45
1px7en8,,"""I'm just gonna poke it,"" he said, reaching for a stick. ""You will not,"" I said, grabbing his arm. My voice was trembling. I couldn't explain my fear.",28,46
1px7en8,,"It was an absolute, unreasoning terror. ""We're leaving. We're turning around and we're leaving right now.""

He pulled his arm away, a flash of defiance in his eyes.",28,47
1px7en8,,"The connection we had started to build was crumbling, replaced by the old wall of teenage rebellion. ""Why? You're being weird.",21,48
1px7en8,,"It's probably just some weird fungus or something.""

""It's not fungus,"" I said. ""We're going.""

He ignored me.",18,49
1px7en8,,"Before I could stop him, he’d pulled out the new hunting knife I’d given him. The polished steel glinted in the dim light. ""What are you doing?"" I hissed.",29,50
1px7en8,,"""I want to see what's inside,"" he said, his voice steady. He was completely focused on the cocoon, his face a mask of intense concentration. I should have tackled him.",30,51
1px7en8,,"I should have dragged him away. But I was frozen, paralyzed by that deep, animal fear and a sudden, sickening premonition.",21,52
1px7en8,,"I watched, helpless, as he reached up and pressed the tip of the knife into the lower part of the pod. It wasn't tough.",24,53
1px7en8,,"The blade sank in with a wet, tearing sound, like cutting through damp cardboard. He pulled the knife down, creating a long, vertical slit.",24,54
1px7en8,,"The smell intensified, a wave of damp decay washing over us. He worked the knife, widening the opening. Something dark and brittle shifted inside.",24,55
1px7en8,,"He put his knife away and, with a grimace, used both hands to pull the two sides of the slit apart.",21,56
1px7en8,,"The contents spilled out onto the forest floor with a dry, hollow rattle. It was a human skeleton.",18,57
1px7en8,,"The bones were clean, bleached to a pale yellowish-white, but stained in places with dark green and brown patches, as if the very substance of the cocoon had seeped into them.",31,58
1px7en8,,"They were tangled with the same fibrous, vine-like material from the pod's exterior, which seemed to have grown through the ribcage and around the long bones of the arms and legs.",31,59
1px7en8,,"A few scraps of what might have been clothing—denim, maybe flannel—were fused into the matted material, almost indistinguishable from the bark and leaves.",23,60
1px7en8,,"The skull rolled a few inches away and came to rest facing up, its empty eye sockets staring at the canopy above.",22,61
1px7en8,,"We both stood there, utterly silent, the sound of our own breathing loud in the still air. The quiet of the woods was menacing.",24,62
1px7en8,,"The bridge between us had reappeared, but this time it was built of shared horror. My son looked pale, his bravado completely gone, replaced by a sick, green tinge.",29,63
1px7en8,,"He stumbled back, his hand over his mouth. It took us a few minutes to get our wits back. I fumbled for my phone, which was useless.",27,64
1px7en8,,"We had to hike back. We marked the spot as best we could and then we walked, fast. We didn't talk.",21,65
1px7en8,,"The only sounds were our footsteps, frantic and loud on the forest floor. The woods felt different now.",18,66
1px7en8,,"Every shadow seemed to stretch, every rustle of leaves sounded like something following us. I felt a thousand unseen eyes on my back.",23,67
1px7en8,,"We made it to a ridge with a single bar of service and called 911. They routed us to the park rangers. I explained what we found, my voice shaking.",30,68
1px7en8,,"They took our location and told us to wait by the main trail. Two rangers met us an hour later. They were calm, professional. They took our statements.",28,69
1px7en8,,"We led them back to the site. They looked at the skeleton, at the bizarre cocoon hanging in tatters from the branch.",22,70
1px7en8,,"One of them poked at it with a stick. ""Never seen anything like this,"" he said to his partner, his face impassive.",22,71
1px7en8,,"""The nest, I mean.""

""Some kind of insect?"" the other asked. ""Not one I know. We'll have the forensics team come out. Probably some missing hiker from years back.",29,72
1px7en8,,"Sad business.""

They told us we were free to go, that they'd contact us if they needed more information. And that was it.",23,73
1px7en8,,They were treating it like a tragic but ultimately explainable event.,11,74
1px7en8,,"A hiker gets lost, dies of exposure, and some strange, undiscovered insect or fungus makes a nest out of the remains.",21,75
1px7en8,,"It sounded almost plausible, if you didn't look too closely at the thing, if you hadn't felt that unnatural dread in its presence.",23,76
1px7en8,,"We hiked back to our planned campsite, neither of us wanting to abandon the trip entirely. It felt like admitting defeat, like letting the horror win.",26,77
1px7en8,,"But the mood was ruined. The easy connection we’d found was gone, replaced by a shared, unspoken trauma. We set up the tent and built a fire.",27,78
1px7en8,,"The flames pushed back the encroaching darkness, but it felt like a flimsy defense. The woods pressed in, black and silent, just beyond the ring of light.",27,79
1px7en8,,"My son sat on a log, poking the fire with a stick. He was quiet again, but it was a different kind of quiet.",24,80
1px7en8,,"Not the sullen, withdrawn silence of a teenager, but something deeper, more thoughtful. More… somber. ""Dad?"" he said, his voice soft.",21,81
1px7en8,,"""You never really told me how grandpa died.""

The question hit me like a physical blow. The timing of it, here, in this place, after what we’d just seen.",29,82
1px7en8,,"My blood ran cold. I took a deep breath. ""He, uh… he got sick.""

""Sick how?""

""His mind,"" I said, struggling for the words. ""He got Alzheimer's. Early onset.",29,83
1px7en8,,"He was only in his late fifties. It was… fast. One day he was just my quiet, grim old man. A few years later, he was… gone.",27,84
1px7en8,,"Even when he was sitting right in front of me.""

The fire crackled, spitting embers into the night sky.",19,85
1px7en8,,"""He was always a loner,"" I continued, the memories flooding back, sharp and painful. ""But the sickness made it worse. He'd get confused, agitated. He'd wander.",26,86
1px7en8,,"One day, he just… walked out of the house. Mom was in the garden for maybe twenty minutes.",18,87
1px7en8,,"When she came back in, he was gone.""

My son looked at me, his eyes reflecting the firelight. He was completely still. ""They searched for him. Police, volunteers, everyone.",29,88
1px7en8,,"They had dogs. They found his tracks leading from the house to the edge of the woods. These woods."" I gestured out into the blackness around us.",27,89
1px7en8,,"""His trail went in, and it just… stopped. They never found anything. Not a shoe, not a piece of clothing. Nothing.",21,90
1px7en8,,"He just vanished in here.""

We sat in silence for a long time after that.",15,91
1px7en8,,"The weight of my story, combined with the skeleton in the woods, settled over our campsite like a shroud. I watched my son.",23,92
1px7en8,,"He was staring into the flames, his expression unreadable.",9,93
1px7en8,,"But something about his posture, the way he held his shoulders, the set of his jaw… it sent a chill down my spine. It was eerily familiar.",27,94
1px7en8,,It was the way my father used to sit. I tried to shake it off. He’s in shock. We both are. He’s just processing what I told him.,28,95
1px7en8,,"It’s a coincidence. But the feeling wouldn't go away. Later, as we were getting ready to turn in, the strangeness started.",21,96
1px7en8,,"I was shivering, a bit of a chill in the air.",11,97
1px7en8,,"I opened my mouth to ask him if he wanted another blanket from the car, the thought just forming in my head.",22,98
1px7en8,,"Before a single word came out, he said, without looking up from unlacing his boots, ""I'm not cold.""

I froze. ""What?""

""I'm fine,"" he said, his voice flat.",28,99
1px7en8,,"He didn't seem to notice anything odd about it. I dismissed it. A lucky guess. We’re father and son, maybe we were just on the same wavelength.",27,100
1px7en8,,But it happened again a few minutes later.,8,101
1px7en8,,"I was thinking about the long hike back in the morning, wondering if we should pack up camp tonight and just sleep in the car.",25,102
1px7en8,,"It was a fleeting, internal debate. ""We should stay,"" he said, his voice quiet but firm, as if responding to a spoken question.",23,103
1px7en8,,"""It's better to get an early start when it's light out.""

This time, a genuine spike of fear shot through me. I stared at him.",25,104
1px7en8,,"He was laying out his sleeping bag in the tent, his movements economical and precise. There was a lack of wasted motion about him that was profoundly unfamiliar.",28,105
1px7en8,,My son was a creature of sprawling limbs and clumsy energy. This was… different. Contained and controlled.,17,106
1px7en8,,"""How did you know I was thinking that?"" I asked, trying to keep my voice steady. He finally looked at me. His eyes seemed… older.",25,107
1px7en8,,"The playful spark, the teenage angst, it was all gone. Replaced by a flat, weary emptiness. ""Just figured,"" he said, and turned away. I didn't sleep that night.",28,108
1px7en8,,"I lay in my sleeping bag, my body rigid, listening to the sound of his slow, even breathing from the other side of the small tent.",26,109
1px7en8,,"Every nocturnal snap of a twig, every hoot of a distant owl, sounded like a threat. I kept replaying the events of the day in my head. The cocoon.",29,110
1px7en8,,The skeleton. My father’s disappearance. My son’s changing demeanor.,9,111
1px7en8,,"The pieces were all there, scattered on the floor of my mind, and they were beginning to form a picture I did not want to see.",26,112
1px7en8,,"The next morning, it was worse. He was up before me, which never happens.",14,113
1px7en8,,"He had already packed his sleeping bag and was sitting by the dead fire, nursing a cup of instant coffee. He didn't greet me.",24,114
1px7en8,,"He just nodded, a short, clipped gesture. It was my father’s nod. I’d received that same nod a thousand times as a boy.",23,115
1px7en8,,We packed up the rest of the camp in near silence. The change was undeniable now. He didn’t slouch. He didn’t drag his feet.,24,116
1px7en8,,"He worked efficiently, his face a hard mask. He looked at the woods around us with a kind of quiet, grim familiarity.",22,117
1px7en8,,"""We should head north-east,"" he said, pointing through the trees. ""It's a more direct route to the trail. Shave an hour off the walk.""

He was right.",27,118
1px7en8,,But I had been the one poring over the map the night before. He’d barely glanced at it. How could he know that?,23,119
1px7en8,,"""How do you know that?"" I asked, my voice tight. He squinted, looking up at the position of the sun. ""Just a feeling.",23,120
1px7en8,,"This way's better.""

And then he did it.",8,121
1px7en8,,"He rubbed the back of his neck with his left hand, a specific, peculiar gesture my father always made when he was thinking or feeling uneasy.",26,122
1px7en8,,A habit I hadn't seen in twenty years. I felt like the ground had dropped out from under me. This wasn't shock. This wasn't my son processing trauma.,28,123
1px7en8,,"Something was fundamentally, terrifyingly wrong. We started walking. He took the lead. He moved through the undergrowth with a confidence that made no sense.",24,124
1px7en8,,He wasn't the city kid who’d been complaining about bugs yesterday. He moved like he belonged here. Like he’d walked these paths his entire life.,25,125
1px7en8,,"My mind was racing, trying to find a rational explanation. A psychotic break? Shared delusion?",15,126
1px7en8,,"But the cold, hard reality of his mannerisms, of his impossible knowledge, defied any easy answer. I had to know. I had to test it. ""Did you...",27,127
1px7en8,,"did you sleep okay?"" I asked, my voice barely a whisper. He didn't turn around. ""Fine. Dreamt of the war.""

I stopped dead. My blood turned to ice water.",29,128
1px7en8,,"""What?""

He stopped and turned to face me. The look on his face was not my son's. It was a tired, haunted look I knew all too well.",28,129
1px7en8,,"It was the look in my father's eyes in his last few years, when the fog of his disease was thick. ""The war,"" he repeated, his voice raspy, unfamiliar.",29,130
1px7en8,,"""The heat. The noise.""

My father had served in Vietnam. He never, ever spoke of it. Not once. But my mother told me he had terrible nightmares his whole life.",30,131
1px7en8,,My son knew none of this. I'd never told him. This was it. The precipice.,15,132
1px7en8,,"I was either losing my mind, or I was speaking to something that was not my child.",17,133
1px7en8,,"I took a shaky breath, my heart feeling like it was going to beat its way out of my chest. I decided to take the leap.",26,134
1px7en8,,"I decided to speak to the ghost. ""Dad?"" I said, the word feeling alien and terrifying in my mouth. The face that was my son's twisted.",26,135
1px7en8,,"For a second, it was him again, a flash of pure confusion and fear in his eyes. ""Dad, what's...?"" And then it was gone, submerged.",25,136
1px7en8,,"The grim, empty mask was back. The eyes focused on me, but they were looking from a great distance. ""You shouldn't have brought the boy here,"" the voice said.",29,137
1px7en8,,"It was my son's voice, but the cadence was all wrong. It was slow, gravelly. It was my father's. Tears streamed down my face.",24,138
1px7en8,,"A horrifying mix of grief and terror. ""What happened to you? What is this place?""

He—it—looked around at the ancient trees, a flicker of profound fear in those old eyes.",30,139
1px7en8,,"""It's hungry,"" he whispered. ""It's always hungry.""

""What is?"" I begged. ""The thing in the tree?",16,140
1px7en8,,"What did it do to you?""

""It doesn't move fast,"" the voice rasped, ignoring my question. ""It's patient. It gets in your head. I was... lost. Confused. The sickness...",29,141
1px7en8,,"it made it easy for it. It finds the ones that are already fading and promises... clarity. A way back.""

A memory surfaced, sharp and terrible.",26,142
1px7en8,,"One of my last clear conversations with my father before the Alzheimer's took him completely. He’d been staring out the window, looking towards the hills where these woods lay.",29,143
1px7en8,,"""I just need to get back there,"" he'd mumbled. ""It's clearer there. I can think there."" We'd thought he was just confused, longing for his youth.",26,144
1px7en8,,"""It led me,"" the voice continued, a tremor running through my son's body. ""Deep in. Talked to me. In... thoughts. Showed me things. Things I'd forgotten. My own father's face.",30,145
1px7en8,,"The day you were born.""

The voice hitched. ""It felt good. To remember. So I followed. I let it... wrap me up. I thought it was keeping me safe.",29,146

He looked down at my son's hands, flexing them as if they were new and strange. ""But it doesn't just take the memories.",27,147
1px7en8,,"It feeds on them. Sips them, like water. And when they're gone... it takes the rest. Slowly. It digests you.",20,148
1px7en8,,"Soul first, then the body.""

The horror of it was absolute. ""When the boy...",14,149
1px7en8,,"when he cut it open..."" The voice faltered, and for a second my son's face contorted in pain. ""It was like a broken line. A connection.",26,150
1px7en8,,"What was left of me... it was just... floating. And the boy was right there. Open. Curious. An empty vessel. So I... I fell in.""

""My God,"" I breathed.",29,151
1px7en8,,"""Is he... is my son gone?""

""No,"" the voice said, and there was a desperate urgency in it now. ""He's here. I'm just... laid over him. A thin sheet.",29,152
1px7en8,,But the thing... it knows. It knows the meal was interrupted. It knows a part of its food escaped.,19,153
1px7en8,,"And it knows there's a fresh one, right here."" He gestured to his own chest, to my son's chest. ""You have to get him out. Now. Before it settles.",29,154
1px7en8,,"Before it decides to take him instead.""

""What about you?"" I sobbed.",12,155
1px7en8,,"""Dad, I can't just leave you.""

The face that was not my son's gave me a sad, grim smile. It was the first time I'd ever seen my father smile.",30,156
1px7en8,,"""I've been gone for twenty years, son. I'm just an echo. Now go. Run. And don't look back.",18,157
1px7en8,,"It's watching us.""

As if on cue, a dead branch fell from a tree high above, crashing to the forest floor just a few feet away with a sound like a gunshot.",32,158
1px7en8,,"It wasn't the wind. The air was dead still. That was it. The spell of horrified paralysis was broken. I grabbed my son's arm. He was limp, his eyes half-closed.",30,159
1px7en8,,"""Come on,"" I yelled, pulling him. ""We have to go!""

We ran. We crashed through the undergrowth, branches whipping at our faces. I half-dragged him, his feet stumbling over roots.",30,160
1px7en8,,"He was in a daze, a passenger in his own body. The woods, which had felt so peaceful just a day before, now felt alive and malignant.",27,161
1px7en8,,"Every tree seemed to lean in, their branches like grasping claws. I felt a pressure in the air, a drop in temperature. It was a feeling of immense, ancient attention.",30,162
1px7en8,,The feeling of a predator whose territory had been invaded and whose prey had been stolen. I didn't dare look back.,21,163
1px7en8,,"I just ran, my lungs burning, my only thought to get my son to the car, to safety. ""Dad?"" my son's real voice, small and scared. ""What's happening?",28,164
1px7en8,,"My head hurts.""

""Just keep running!"" I screamed. A moment later, the other voice, the raspy whisper. ""Faster. It's close.",20,165
1px7en8,,"I can feel it pulling.""

He was switching back and forth. A terrible, psychic tug-of-war was happening inside my child's head. One moment, he was my terrified sixteen-year-old.",28,166
1px7en8,,"The next, he was the fading ghost of my father, urging us on. ""The edge of the woods,"" the ghost-voice gasped. ""It doesn't like the open spaces. The iron.",29,167
1px7en8,,"The roads.""

We could see it, then. A break in the trees. The faint glint of sunlight on a car's windshield. The gravel of the parking area.",27,168
1px7en8,,It was maybe two hundred yards away. It felt like a thousand miles. The feeling of being watched intensified.,19,169
1px7en8,,"It was a physical weight now, pressing on my back, trying to slow me down. I heard a sound behind us, a soft, wet, dragging sound. I didn't look.",29,170
1px7en8,,"I couldn't. I just pulled my son harder. ""I can't... hold on much longer,"" my father's voice whispered, weak and thin. ""It's pulling me back...",25,171
1px7en8,,"wants to finish...""

""Fight it, Dad!"" I screamed, not knowing who I was talking to anymore. ""Tell your mother... I'm sorry I..."" The voice dissolved into a choked gasp.",29,172
1px7en8,,"My son's body went rigid. He cried out, a sharp, terrified sound. ""Dad! It's in my head! I can feel it!""

We were fifty feet from the treeline. Thirty. Twenty.",30,173
1px7en8,,"With one final, desperate surge, I threw us forward, out of the shade of the trees and into the bright, clear sunlight of the parking lot.",26,174
1px7en8,,"We tumbled onto the gravel, scraping our hands and knees. The moment we crossed the line, it was like a switch was flipped. The immense pressure on my back vanished.",30,175
1px7en8,,"The air grew warm again. The menacing silence of the woods was replaced by the distant sound of a car on the highway. My son lay on the ground, gasping.",30,176
1px7en8,,"He pushed himself up, his eyes wide with confusion. They were his eyes again. Just his. Young, scared, and completely his own. ""Dad? What...",24,177
1px7en8,,"what the hell?"" he asked, his voice trembling. ""Why were we running? I... I was at the campfire. You were telling me about grandpa. And now... we're here.",28,178
1px7en8,,"My head is killing me.""

He didn't remember. He didn't remember the morning. The walk. The conversation. He didn't remember his own grandfather speaking through his lips.",27,179
1px7en8,,It was all gone. I couldn't bring myself to tell him. Not then. Maybe not ever. How could I explain it?,21,180
1px7en8,,"I just pulled him to his feet, hugged him tighter than I ever have in my life, and got him in the car. We drove away and didn't look back.",30,181
1px7en8,,"We’ve been home for four days. He seems normal. Back to his phone, his headphones, his grunts. But sometimes, I catch him staring off into space.",26,182
1px7en8,,"And once, just once, I saw him standing at the window, looking out at the trees in our backyard.",19,183
1px7en8,,"He was rubbing the back of his neck with his left hand. And his face, for just a second, was a mask of grim, weary silence.",26,184
1px7en8,,"I know my father saved us. His echo, his ghost, whatever it was, it warned us.",16,185
1px7en8,,"But I also know that when you disturb something ancient and hungry, it doesn't just forget. Part of my father got out.",22,186
1px7en8,,"I think a tiny, little piece of whatever was hunting him might have followed. I don’t know what was in that cocoon.",22,187
1px7en8,,"I don’t know what it is that lives in those woods. But I know it feeds on people, and it’s patient. And I know it’s still there, waiting.",28,188

1pwy064,,I skipped breakfast and rushed out the door. My usual route was blocked due to construction. Even pedestrians weren’t allowed near the area.,23,5
1pwy064,,"With no other choice, I turned into a small nearby alley. And that was the biggest mistake of my life. That evening, I didn’t get off work until nearly eight.",30,6
1pwy064,,"Because I arrived late that morning, I was punished by being forced to stay overtime.",15,7
1pwy064,,"On my way home, I remembered that the main road was still closed, so once again, I chose to go through the same alley from earlier that day.",28,8
1pwy064,,"The alley was dark. Although there were a few solar-powered lights, their glow was weak barely enough to illuminate the length of the path.",24,9
1pwy064,,"When I was halfway through, I heard something behind me. I turned around. There was no one there.",18,10
1pwy064,,"But every time I took another step forward, the sound followed slow, steady, as if it were copying my footsteps. My heart started pounding. I began to run.",28,11

1pwy064,,"When I got home, I rushed straight into the bathroom. I hate the feeling of sweat clinging to my skin.",20,13
1pwy064,,"As I soaked in the hot water, my dog suddenly started barking wildly. That was strange. He never barked for no reason.",22,14
1pwy064,,He only did that when a stranger came near the house. Then suddenly… he went silent. That silence sent a chill down my spine. I tried to reassure myself.,29,15
1pwy064,,"“He’s probably just hungry. I didn’t feed him this morning.”

Just then, my phone vibrated. A message from an unknown number. The attached photo made my heart stop.",28,16
1pwy064,,"It was my dog lying motionless in front of my house. Before I could process what was happening, I heard a loud crash from outside. Glass shattering.",27,17

“Someone broke into my house!",17,18
1pwy064,,"I don’t know who he is!”

“Please stay calm and tell us your address.”

I followed every instruction they gave me.",21,19
1pwy064,,"I got dressed, turned off all the lights, and grabbed a mop as a weapon. I hid behind the bathroom door. A dark figure slowly stepped into the house.",29,20
1pwy064,,"I gathered all my strength and swung the mop at him. He staggered, let out a hoarse groan, and collapsed face-first onto the floor.",24,21
1pwy064,,"I ran upstairs to grab a can of pepper spray, planning to lock myself in a room but… a hand blocked the door.",23,22
1pwy064,,"I threw my entire body against it, but my strength was nothing compared to his. I fell to the floor.",20,23
1pwy064,,"He stepped toward me, holding a stun gun in his hand. I broke down crying, completely hopeless. Then, from downstairs, I heard many footsteps. “Police!",25,24
1pwy064,,"Don’t move!”

I screamed, “He has a weapon!”

He turned around, but before he could do anything, the officers subdued him. The next morning, I moved to a different place.",30,25
1pwy064,,"It’s farther from work, but much safer. What struck me as strange was that the area also has a lake erfect for morning walks.",24,26
1pwy064,,"Before leaving, I took my dog to the vet. The doctor said he had only been knocked unconscious from a hard blow to the head. His life wasn’t in danger.",30,27

1pwunqf,,"She didn’t look any special, frizzy brown hair, blouse and slacks.",11,6
1pwunqf,,"But because of her I was able to buy food from 7/11 for a week, and when I ran out of that fifty she came back with another.",28,7
1pwunqf,,It became a habit that every week she would come by and give me fifty dollars and when it was the end of the month she would give me some of her groceries.,33,8
1pwunqf,,I learned her name after two months of this. Her name was Marianne and she worked for the local church as a Sunday school teacher and accountant.,27,9
1pwunqf,,"She never tried to proselytize me or anything, she never even invited me to her church, she just came by and gave me stuff.",24,10

1pwunqf,,"One day, she proposed that I move in with her. She had an extra bedroom and she didn’t want rent. I expected the worst; secret cult, grooming, serial killing.",29,12
1pwunqf,,But I trusted her. I guess it was the kindness she showed that made me work against my better judgement but my consciousness was proved wrong.,26,13
1pwunqf,,The first night I stayed she gave me a heapful serving of spaghetti and free access to the bathtub.,19,14
1pwunqf,,"It was the first time I have been warm and full in years. Her house was nice. Two-story, quiet suburb.",20,15
1pwunqf,,She gave me my own bedroom already fitted out with a bed and a few clothes in the closet.,19,16
1pwunqf,,"She never pestered me to get a job, or to help out, she just let me live in her house. The house was decorated straight out of the 80s.",29,17
1pwunqf,,"Various crocheted decorations, a bunch of crosses and bible quotes on the walls, and a fat tv with a VCR and cable box.",23,18
1pwunqf,,"What irked me was that all the pictures around the house were all of an old lady and her family, who were all blonde.",24,19
1pwunqf,,I asked Marianne and she told me that she used to take care of that old lady until she died and that she gave her the house and all the money in her will.,34,20

1pwunqf,,The money was around six million dollars so that was nothing to sneeze at. The old lady was really good at stock bets.,23,22
1pwunqf,,"Staying with Marianne for two years, one thing that never really settled with me was her severe generosity.",18,23
1pwunqf,,One Thanksgiving she invited an entire town of homeless strangers to her house for a meal.,16,24

1pwunqf,,She gave away her car to the family next door whose car was decked due to the teenage son drinking and driving.,22,26

1pwunqf,,"They had to give her a raise just so she can have her base salary. She was insane, but everyone loved her for it.",24,28
1pwunqf,,The whole town called her their angel from heaven. If I didn’t know any better I would’ve thought that this small town secretly worshipped her as their cult leader.,29,29
1pwunqf,,But at some point I learned to see her from their point of view. It’s hard to deny her calm and charming demeanor. But she never slept.,27,30
1pwunqf,,I never heard her use the bathroom and she never set a serving of food for herself.,17,31

1pwunqf,,She had been watching grainy gray tv for years so I wanted to do something nice for her.,18,36
1pwunqf,,I got a job at a fast food place in town and I saved up enough money to get something for her. She needed receive some generosity for a change.,30,37
1pwunqf,,We went into the city at night and went to this department store with the right tv within my budget.,20,38

1pwunqf,,"I started shouting, “What are you talking about, Mary, what do you mean?!” 

Then her face started melting.",18,47

1pwunqf,,"They were all looking at me, the eyes of all different colors staring at me.",15,50
1pwunqf,,"I vomited on the floor, looking at her arms, staining her pink frilly blouse, the same eyes embedded into her arms, hands, and fingers were staring.",26,51
1pwunqf,,I crawled to the wall behind me and I screamed.,10,52
1pwunqf,,“Be not afraid.” She said in a horse deep voice as cracks started to form and spread between her many many eyes.,22,53
1pwunqf,,A light piercing throughout her skeleton exploded into a bright light. My eyes burned like hot pokers were being skewered into my eye sockets.,24,54
1pwunqf,,"And after a few seconds, she was gone. The only thing I could see in my blurry vision was what was left of her, her charred clothes.",27,55

1pwppgb,,I was in a void. I felt like I was endlessly falling through a void in space.,17,3

1pwppgb,,I had fallen asleep on the living room floor. My gaze drifted down. There was blood pooled at my sides. A discarded razor blade at my feet.,27,8

1pwppgb,,"You…you tried-”

“I didn’t.” I interrupted her, the memory of the previous night coming back to me. I couldn’t remember falling asleep. I couldn’t remember slashing my wrists.",28,12
1pwppgb,,I couldn’t remember anything except seeing my mother. I looked into Maddie’s red-rimmed eyes and felt my heart catch in my throat.,22,13

“I won’t,” I promised in a whisper and kissed the top of her head. “I’m sorry.",20,18
1pwppgb,,I didn’t…I can’t remember what happened.” She lifted a shaky hand and caressed my cheek. “Talk to me.” Her head lifted and stared directly into my eyes.,27,19
1pwppgb,,She always did this when she thought I was about to lie. I hated how much it worked.,18,20

1pwppgb,,"“I just…I feel like I’m going fucking crazy.”

“You’ve been through a lot, Kris.” Her voice was gentle, like she was handling glass. “More than you should have.",28,22

I always hated the idea of therapy.",24,23

1pwppgb,,I’m already so crazy I nearly killed myself in my sleep; what would she think if I told her about the frozen door that came and went at random?,29,27
1pwppgb,,"Or the kitchen that redesigned itself in the blink of an eye? I cleared my throat and spoke quietly. “I’m scared, Mads,” I admitted.",24,28
1pwppgb,,"“Of my mom, of Darren, of this fucking house.” I felt tears threaten to spill. Maddie’s thumb slowly rubbed my cheek.",21,29
1pwppgb,,"“I just…I want to stop being scared.” She brought her lips to mine and gave me a gentle, tentative kiss.",20,30
1pwppgb,,"When she pulled away, I watched a tear roll down her cheek. “I’ll tell mom and dad I’m staying with Liv for Christmas.",23,31
1pwppgb,,"I’m not leaving you alone anymore.”

“I don’t need-”

“Stop it.” She spat with a venom I hadn’t heard from her in a while. “Stop pretending you’re fine. You’re not.",30,32
1pwppgb,,"Just…” she huffed and sat up. “Please, Kris. I’m scared.” I saw the terror in her eyes.",17,33
1pwppgb,,"I saw everything she felt, and I wanted to make sure I never saw that again. “Okay,” I whispered with a sigh.",22,34
1pwppgb,,"“Okay, stay.” She managed a small, broken smile and kissed me again. “I love you, Kris.”

I froze.",18,35
1pwppgb,,That was the first time I’d ever heard those words come off her lips. They stunned me. I felt the air grow warmer and my heart get faster.,28,36
1pwppgb,,My throat was too dry to speak. Maddie gave a small laugh.,12,37
1pwppgb,,"“It’s okay, idiot, I know you love me.” 

The rest of the day went by easily compared to the rest of the week. The house felt like a home.",29,38
1pwppgb,,"Maddie baked us cookies, had to stop me from picking at my bandages, and the house seemed to stay exactly as it had when we first got there.",28,39
1pwppgb,,"As we munched on cookies and sipped glasses of milk, I heard her laugh echo farther than it should’ve. It bounced off walls that didn’t exist.",26,40
1pwppgb,,I felt that familiar chill run up my spine. I ignored it. Maddie looked happy. I couldn’t ruin that.,19,41
1pwppgb,,"As we moved to the bedroom, I glanced at the wall opposite the door. Blank. Just a wall. I only stared for a few moments.",25,42
1pwppgb,,I didn’t want to freak Maddie out more than I already had. “Mind if I wear one of your shirts?” She asked as she opened the squeaky closet door.,29,43
1pwppgb,,"“Wow, I can’t believe you’re asking this time.” I mumbled under my breath. “What the hell?” I heard Maddie mutter behind me.",22,44
1pwppgb,,I turned and saw the subject of her confusion. On the other side of that door was a bedroom. A familiar bedroom. My bedroom. Maddie’s body stiffened.,27,45
1pwppgb,,"I watched as she took a careful step inside. “Kris?” She called out shakily. “What is this?”

I couldn’t answer. I stared into the room.",25,46
1pwppgb,,I knew exactly what it was.,6,47
1pwppgb,,"The NOFX and Dead Kennedys posters sloppily pinned to the wall, the stack of records next to the bed, the old patch-filled denim vest on the floor—this was fourteen-year-old me’s room.",31,48
1pwppgb,,"“It’s my room.” I said under my breath without thought. Her eyes found me when she turned, wide and shocked. “H-how?”

“Get out of there.” I demanded through gritted teeth.",30,49
1pwppgb,,We both jumped when we heard a voice come out of the impossible room. “Don’t you fucking walk away from me!” My mother’s voice screeched.,25,50
1pwppgb,,We heard a door slam and watched my younger self pick up the vest and throw it on.,18,51
1pwppgb,,"Maddie took a few steps back and covered her mouth with her hand. “That’s you,” she whispered, her voice trembling. “Kris, that’s you!” My legs moved without thought.",28,52
1pwppgb,,I grabbed her arm and pulled her back. “Mads!” I scolded her. She jerked her arm away and whipped her head back at me.,24,53
1pwppgb,,"“What the fuck is this, Kris?” Her voice was shaky, and I could see the utter confusion and fear on her face. “I don't know,” I whispered.",27,54
1pwppgb,,"It seemed that was a good enough answer for her. I reached for the door handle to shut this memory away, only to find the handle was gone.",28,55
1pwppgb,,The door was stuck in the wall. “Fuck.” I muttered under my breath. My eyes slowly drifted back to the impossible.,21,56
1pwppgb,,"Maddie was a statue, her eyes glued to my younger self. I didn't stop her from watching. It wanted her to see this.",23,57
1pwppgb,,"Whatever the fuck the house was, it was showing her this, and it felt like I had no way of stopping it.",22,58
1pwppgb,,My younger self climbed onto the bed and tried to lift the window. That window was always a bitch to get open.,22,59
1pwppgb,,“Don't you even think about it!” My mother’s voice leaked from the other side of the room.,17,60
1pwppgb,,"“Fuck you.” My younger self spat at her, only to have my mother pull him off the bed by his hair. “Get off him!” Maddie yelled, seemingly out of instinct.",30,61
1pwppgb,,"She stepped inside the room, and I immediately chased after her. “Maddie!” Before I could get to her, she reached out and tried to smack my mother.",27,62
1pwppgb,,"Her hand went right through her head. We both stopped in place. Cautiously, she reached for her again. Straight through. Like we were trying to touch a ghost.",28,63
1pwppgb,,"“Listen, you little shit,” venom spewed from my mother's mouth, “I do not want the police around here again, so you aren't leaving this house, you hear me?” 

“We need to get out of here.” I said with a waiver in my voice.",43,64
1pwppgb,,Maddie wouldn't budge. “Kris…” She breathed out quietly. “Is…did this happen?” I didn't answer. I just tugged her arm and tried to pull her back to where we came from.,30,65
1pwppgb,,It was gone. My eyes widened as a poster of Johnny Rotten stared right back at me. “Where's the door?” I said hurriedly.,23,66
1pwppgb,,“Where—the door was right here!” I turned and saw Maddie had turned back around.,14,67
1pwppgb,,"I followed her gaze and found what she was stuck on; blood dripping out of my younger self's mouth, with my mother standing over him.",25,68
1pwppgb,,"“Do you fucking understand?” 

“Y-yeah.” His voice was weak. My stomach turned. I could feel the pain again.",18,69
1pwppgb,,I remembered the fear I felt when I saw my mother's fist fly towards me. I heard Maddie sniffle.,19,70
1pwppgb,,"“Fucking useless.” Those were the last words my mother spat before she left the room. The room was silent. The three of us stood still, frozen in confusion and fear.",30,71
1pwppgb,,"Something metal hit the floor. He fumbled with something in his shaking hands. A razor. “We need to go.” I suggested, knowing precisely what would happen. No movement from Maddie.",30,72
1pwppgb,,"“Don't…” She whispered, a weak attempt to change my past. The first slash was silent. I couldn't bear to look at it.",22,73
1pwppgb,,"Yet, I felt my own wrists burn underneath my bandages. I squeezed my eyes shut for a moment, and when they opened, I found the door in front of me.",30,74
1pwppgb,,Open. A way out. I grabbed Maddie’s hand and pulled her out of the room. The door slammed shut behind us and closed us off to the memory. Silence.,29,75
1pwppgb,,"It weaved between us, filled in the gaps, and constricted around us like a snake. I couldn’t look at her. Not after what she’s seen.",25,76
1pwppgb,,"I kept my back to her, but felt her eyes burning a hole through my skull. “Was that real?” Her words felt light, broken. “It…” I swallowed. “Yeah.",28,77
1pwppgb,,"It happened.”

“How did we see it?”

“I don’t know.” She took a few moments to collect her thoughts.",19,78
1pwppgb,,"“Kris, why did you never tell me?” My hands balled at my sides. “Mads—”

“Be fucking honest with me.” Her voice raised and my skin prickled.",26,79
1pwppgb,,"“I never asked because I didn’t want to cross a line, but Jesus, Kris, how long has this been happening?” My jaw tightened.",23,80
1pwppgb,,I took a deep breath before I found an excuse. “A long time.” I answered simply. I listened to her sigh before her fingers carefully wrapped around my arm.,29,81
1pwppgb,,"“We should get out of here.” Her voice was silk now, comforting.",12,82
1pwppgb,,"‘I don’t know what that was, but I don’t want anything like that happening again.” I finally turned to look at her and saw the way her eyes sparkled.",29,83
1pwppgb,,"It was comforting, but she couldn’t hide the fear on her face. She was like that. Reality was crumbling, and she wanted to save me first.",26,84
1pwppgb,,"“There’s something wrong with this place.” I muttered under my breath. “Whatever your dad pays for this place, it isn’t enough.” A quiet giggle escaped Maddie.",26,85
1pwppgb,,"I felt my mouth curve into a small smile. My hand took hers, I placed a small kiss on her lips, and we headed for the door.",27,86
1pwppgb,,"We entered the living room, and Maddie gasped. I just gave a half-hearted laugh. Windows were gone. Door was gone—just the wall. “Kris?” Maddie asked shakily.",26,87
1pwppgb,,"I squeezed her hand, but didn’t answer. I just laughed again. There was a door on the wall, now. Iced over, foggy, giggling.",23,88
1pwppgb,,“Fuck you.” I mumbled as I stared at the door. Maddie shivered and shuffled closer to me.,17,89
1pwppgb,,"“What the fuck is happening?”

“I wish I could tell you.” The door laughed again. This time, I laughed back.",20,90

I never truly understood how heavy silence could feel until that moment, standing in the doorway.",27,0
1pwosot,,"I felt like a piece of trash he’d finally decided to toss out. “We need to go in,” the woman guiding me murmured. “You have to.”

Her tone wasn’t obedient.",30,1
1pwosot,,"It was resigned and defeated. She didn’t sound like someone following orders out of fear, but like someone who believed she no longer had the right to choose anymore.",29,2
1pwosot,,"My chest tightened. “Please,” I whispered. “I don’t want to…”

“What you want doesn’t matter.” She quickly snapped back.",19,3
1pwosot,,"“Not anymore, anyway.”

Her words didn’t feel like a reprimand, but just a plain fact. She was only repeating what she knew. It seemed that was all she had left.",30,4
1pwosot,,"When we reached the cage, she paused briefly. Her eyes closed as she drew in a steady breath.",18,5
1pwosot,,"Then, without warning, she snapped her head toward me, fixing her gaze on mine as she pushed me closer to the bars.",22,6
1pwosot,,"Her voice was barely louder than the buzzing bulb overhead, but she made sure I could hear every word as she leaned closer. “Don’t speak.",25,7
1pwosot,,"If he hears you, he will hurt all of us,” she said plainly. My skin crawled. “Why?” I asked without thinking. “Shh.” She hissed in return.",26,8
1pwosot,,Her voice fell silent as she pulled a key from her apron and began unlocking the cage door.,18,9
1pwosot,,"She opened it slowly, the latch clicking with a metallic snap that echoed off the walls. The woman inside pushed herself up from the floor to look at me.",29,10
1pwosot,,"Her gaze released the dread I’d been holding back at the edges of my mind, allowing it to surge forward and swallow me whole.",24,11
1pwosot,,"Up close, I could now look into her eyes.",9,12
1pwosot,,"They were empty, but not lifeless, as if everything that made her a person had been stripped away, leaving the frail naked thing in front of me in its place.",30,13
1pwosot,,"She blinked slowly, a faint twitch rippling across her cheek. “You need to kneel,” the woman behind me said. “What? Why?” I asked, confused.",24,14
1pwosot,,"“Kneel,” she repeated, a sharp panic edging into her voice. She jerked the cuffs hard enough to send me stumbling forward.",21,15
1pwosot,,"I fell, catching myself with my hands on the concrete. Pain shot through my palms, but it barely registered.",19,16
1pwosot,,"The caged woman had started moving as I hit the ground, crawling toward me with an unnatural sort of grace.",20,17
1pwosot,,"Her motions were careful and deliberate, the precision clearly practiced, like she had learned exactly how to move to avoid punishment.",21,18
1pwosot,,"“Don’t touch her,” the woman behind me whispered, her voice shaky. “Not yet. She reacts violently to touch.”

I dropped my gaze to the floor to avoid eye contact.",29,19
1pwosot,,I didn’t even want to look at her. My heart hammered against my ribs so hard that I worried she would hear it. She crawled closer.,26,20
1pwosot,,"I could hear the scrape of her rough, calloused knees dragging across the concrete as she inched to within a foot of me.",23,21
1pwosot,,"I braced myself, though I didn’t know why, or for what. She was a prisoner, like me.",17,22
1pwosot,,"Just when it felt like the tension in the room had reached its breaking point, a small, fragile voice crept into my ears. “…Emily…”

My blood froze.",27,23
1pwosot,,"The woman’s voice was soft and jagged at the same time, like a rasp from a throat that had forgotten how to form words. But it was my name.",29,24
1pwosot,,How could she possibly know who I was?,8,25
1pwosot,,"Hearing it from her felt like someone had slipped a thin blade between my ribs and twisted it, hollowing out my chest with an instant mix of guilt and sorrow.",30,26
1pwosot,,"The woman behind me, the one guiding me, flinched violently, as though the sound of the caged woman’s voice physically hurt her. “Don’t respond,” she hissed.",26,27
1pwosot,,"“Do not let him hear your voice.”

My lungs tightened. “But… How does she know my…”

“Quiet.” She cut in.",20,28
1pwosot,,"She pulled the chain again, forcing me closer to the other woman.",12,29
1pwosot,,"My knees pressed against the cold concrete as she lifted her trembling hand and began threading her fingers through my greasy, unkempt hair.",23,30
1pwosot,,"She smelled like sweat and something damp, something faintly sour. I don’t know how, but I could smell the fear and torment emanating from her.",25,31
1pwosot,,"Her fingers slid across my scalp like she was studying me, sending jolts through my body. It wasn’t pain or fear, but something that made me feel worse.",28,32
1pwosot,,"It felt like recognition, as if this were always meant to happen. Her mouth opened slightly, the corners twitching as if something inside her was trying to get out.",29,33
1pwosot,,"That same rasping voice came leaking out, this time no longer soft or timid. “Don’t let him name you.” She said flatly.",22,34
1pwosot,,"I didn’t even have time to process her words before the woman behind me snapped back at her. “Dammit, not yet. You can’t tell her yet.",26,35
1pwosot,,"If he knows you told her, he’s going to hurt you again.",12,36
1pwosot,,"You know that.”

There was a tremor in her voice, not because of the woman in the cage, but because of what she was saying.",25,37
1pwosot,,"I was never meant to know the truth. The woman blinked again. Her eyes shifted past me, locking onto the one gripping my cuffs.",24,38
1pwosot,,"She gave a slight tilt of her head, subtle but questioning. “It’s not time. Not here.",16,39
1pwosot,,"If he hears us, then he’ll…”

She cut herself off abruptly, her voice strangled by something she couldn’t bring herself to say.",22,40
1pwosot,,"She leaned away from us, shifting uncomfortably behind me. The tension in the air thickened, stretching a heavy silence between us. I swallowed hard. “Please,” I whispered.",27,41
1pwosot,,"“Tell me what…”

Before I could finish, a hand shot out from behind me, clamping over my mouth.",18,42
1pwosot,,"The woman’s cold, shaking fingers pressed against my lips with enough pressure to bruise. “Don’t talk,” she said sharply.",19,43
1pwosot,,"“If he comes in and hears your voice, you won’t leave this room the same. Understand?”

Tears stung my eyes as I nodded, terrified to even move.",27,44
1pwosot,,"“Good.”

She let up on her grip slightly, testing whether I truly understood. “What does that mean?” I tried to ask, but it came out muffled against her palm.",29,45
1pwosot,,"She removed her hand and exhaled a deep, exasperated breath as she pulled away from me. “It means there are versions of us,” she said quietly. “Stages.",27,46
1pwosot,,He breaks us down until we stop fighting and stop thinking.,11,47
1pwosot,,"Until you can’t recognize the difference between obedience and survival anymore.”

Her voice caught in her throat for a moment. “At the final stage, he names you.",27,48
1pwosot,,That’s when he truly owns you. That’s when you know you will never leave this place.,16,49
1pwosot,,"Your old self dies, leaving behind what you see in front of you there… a shriveled husk.”

Every part of me went cold.",23,50
1pwosot,,"The caged woman’s fingertips slid off my scalp, retreating to the floor in front of her. The woman behind me leaned closer, loosening her grip on the handcuffs.",28,51
1pwosot,,"She crouched down next to my ear, her voice morphing into a fragile whisper. “He only uses your real name at first… when you’re fresh.",25,52
1pwosot,,That’s the beginning of his process.,6,53
1pwosot,,"Once you let him call you by it willingly, well, then everything else becomes easier for him to take.”

The caged woman nodded weakly, her breath rattling in her chest.",30,54
1pwosot,,“He will take everything from you.” She added. I was so lost and confused.,14,55
1pwosot,,"My mind couldn’t comprehend what they were telling me, but I was determined to find out what it all meant.",20,56
1pwosot,,"“What does he do when you reach the final stage?” I whispered, turning back to look at the woman behind me.",21,57
1pwosot,,"She hesitated, tightening her jaw until her teeth scraped together. Pain flickered across her expression like she was re-living a horrific memory.",22,58
1pwosot,,"“When he names you,” she said slowly, “you stop being who you were. He cuts away everything that resists him. Every thought that questions him. Every instinct that rebels.",29,59
1pwosot,,"He remolds you into what he wants.”

My stomach churned. “You mean he’s brainwashing women?” I breathed. Her eyes snapped to mine. “No. Brainwashing changes your mind.",27,60
1pwosot,,This… changes your identity… your soul.,6,61
1pwosot,,"He digs into you like he’s carving a gourd, scraping out what made you whole until there is nothing left.”

I swallowed hard, trying to contain the fear building within me.",31,62
1pwosot,,"“What stage are you?” I asked. She looked away, clearly trying to hold back a waterfall of tears.",18,63
1pwosot,,"“I’m at the stage where I don’t try anymore.” She answered, “There’s no point in it.”

Her words hit me like a punch to the gut, but they also made sense in my mind.",34,64
1pwosot,,She was the only other person I had ever seen who wasn’t chained up or in a cage. “Is that why you can walk around freely?” I whispered.,28,65
1pwosot,,"“Because he trusts you?”

She drew in a shuddering breath as tears fell from her eyes. “No.” She responded. “He broke me.",22,66
1pwosot,,"I’d rather die in here than feel his hands on my skin again.”

She looked down at the floor, letting the tears drip across the concrete.",26,67
1pwosot,,"“Maybe one day, I’ll find the courage to do it.”

Absolute silence settled over the room, devoid of any comfort.",20,68
1pwosot,,"Aside from the three of us, only the cold, hard walls heard her cries.",14,69
1pwosot,,"After a long pause, she lifted her head, wiping the tears from her face as she spoke again.",18,70
1pwosot,,"“He calls me Mara.”

Her voice trembled on the name, tinged with both shame and resignation. “That’s not my real name,” she added quickly, almost defensively.",26,71
1pwosot,,"“But it’s what he named me. So, it’s who I am now.”

I stared at her, my heart pounding so violently I thought my ribs might crack.",27,72
1pwosot,,"“What’s your real name?” I asked gently, trying not to disturb her any more than I had to.",18,73
1pwosot,,"Mara’s eyes darted toward the door as if she expected him to appear there at any second. “It doesn’t matter,” she whispered. “He took it.",25,74
1pwosot,,"It’s his now.”

The woman in the cage rasped something under her breath. Mara turned her head slightly, listening intently to what she was trying to say.",27,75
1pwosot,,"The woman repeated the soft, broken words over and over. “She needs to know, Mara.”

Mara swallowed hard.",18,76
1pwosot,,"“If I tell her, he’ll find out and punish us both.”

“How?” I asked.",14,77
1pwosot,,"She didn’t answer, but the caged woman spoke up, this time slower, making sure I could hear her clearly. “You… didn’t choose to learn.",24,78
1pwosot,,"He will… hurt you until… until you do.”

It seemed like every word took more and more strength out of her.",21,79
1pwosot,,Mara’s face twisted with guilt as she listened to the woman speak.,12,80
1pwosot,,"She looked back at me and whispered, “Her name is Lilith.”

A cold shiver ran through me as the pieces finally clicked into place.",24,81
1pwosot,,The cruel reality settled over my mind like a suffocating weight. I would most likely become just like them.,19,82
1pwosot,,"Reduced to nothing but a hollow existence of involuntary servitude for a monster. “She was like you once,” Mara said softly. “New. Terrified. Fighting every second.” Her voice wavered.",29,83
1pwosot,,"“She lasted the longest of any of us before she stopped trying.”

A single tear slid down Lilith’s cheek.",19,84
1pwosot,,"“She stopped fighting when he named her.”

Lilith let out a weak, broken sob, exhaling like she had torn something loose inside her.",23,85
1pwosot,,"“Don’t answer him, Emily,” she breathed, body convulsing in fear and pain. Her arms contorted, and her back twisted as a violent tremor seized her body.",26,86
1pwosot,,"A strangled cry rippled from her throat, echoing sharply off the concrete and steel.",14,87
1pwosot,,"Mara grabbed me, yanking me backward so fast the cuffs bit into my wrists, feeling like they would break. “He’s coming,” she hissed in my ear. “What?",27,88
1pwosot,,"How do you…?” I stammered, barely processing her words. “Be quiet.” She snapped. Her fingers tightened painfully around my arms as she held me back.",25,89
1pwosot,,"The basement doorknob groaned, the sound of scraping metal slicing the silence. Mara went rigid, her head snapping to the door, eyes wide and hollow with terror.",27,90
1pwosot,,"The door creaked as the lock clicked open, sending a shockwave of sound through the room.",16,91
1pwosot,,"Panic twisted in her features as she shoved me back, away from Lilith’s writhing body.",15,92
1pwosot,,"I stumbled, landing on my knees as she forced me down, pressing me into the cold floor. “Emily,” she whispered urgently, pushing her forehead against mine. “Listen to me.",29,93
1pwosot,,This is important.” Her voice shook with a mix of fear and desperation.,13,94
1pwosot,,"“When he comes in, he will say your name.”

Her nails dug into my skin as her breathing got faster. “You must not respond, understand?”

“Why?",26,95
1pwosot,,"What happens if I…?”

“He will think you’re ready,” she cut me off, her voice lower than a whisper. The latch clicked softly, and the door began to open.",29,96
1pwosot,,"Mara’s breath caught in her throat as she pressed her forehead to mine harder, panic blazing in her eyes. “You are not ready,” she whispered desperately. “Please.",27,97
1pwosot,,Don’t let him start on you. Don’t let him take your name. Fight it as long as you can. Fight longer than I did.,24,98
1pwosot,,"Longer than Lilith did.”

The door swung fully open.",9,99
1pwosot,,"Mara shoved my head down, forcing me to bow, her entire body collapsing into terrified obedience, as though she were a puppet whose strings had been cut.",27,100
1pwosot,,"Then, he stepped inside. His silhouette filled the doorway’s glow, positioned perfectly so that he would only be seen how he wanted. Everything was done on his terms.",28,101
1pwosot,,"He closed the door with a soft, careful click, then smiled, his expression warm, almost paternal, but entirely out of place. “Emily,” he said, voice low, almost affectionate.",28,102
1pwosot,,"“There you are.”

Mara bowed her head at once.",9,103
1pwosot,,"Behind me, Lilith had gone completely still, the only sound in the room being the faint breathing from the four of us. The man took a slow step toward me.",30,104
1pwosot,,"“Emily,” he said again. “Look at me.”

My heart pounded violently in my chest as I felt my body going almost completely numb with fear.",25,105
1pwosot,,"Mara trembled beside me, and behind me, I could hear Lilith whimpering softly. I remained silent, not moving, barely breathing, staring at the ground.",24,106
1pwosot,,"I didn’t dare look up at him. He crouched down in front of me, tilting his head, a strange tenderness overtaking him that made my stomach churn.",27,107
1pwosot,,"“Emily,” he repeated once more, slower this time, testing me. “Why won’t you answer me?”

I kept my mouth shut.",20,108
1pwosot,,"After Mara’s warning, there was no way in hell he was going to get me to speak.",17,109
1pwosot,,"The man’s smile widened, but I swore I could feel something shift beneath it. It wasn’t anger or frustration. It was something more unsettling than that.",26,110
1pwosot,,"It felt more like excitement or curiosity. He leaned in closer, lowering his voice to a murmur. “Oh, good,” he whispered.",21,111
1pwosot,,"“You’re not ready yet.”

There was no trace of kindness in his voice, no hint of malice, just a cold certainty of a promise he meant to keep.",28,112
1pwosot,,"He straightened, brushing invisible dust from his hands, gesturing for Mara to rise. She obeyed without a word, her face falling back into that empty, vacant expression.",27,113
1pwosot,,"Turning toward Lilith’s cage, he spoke with casual indifference. “We’ll continue her lesson tomorrow.”

She flinched violently at the sound of his voice, curling herself up tightly into a ball.",30,114
1pwosot,,"She didn’t acknowledge her movement, as his attention was already on me again, his fingers stretching out toward my face.",20,115
1pwosot,,"A primal fear clawed at my chest, and my body screamed to pull away, but Mara’s grip tightened, a silent warning forcing me to stay still.",26,116
1pwosot,,"He pushed two fingers beneath my chin, tilting my face upward until our eyes locked.",15,117
1pwosot,,"“I don’t think I’ll name you just yet,” he murmured, his voice soft but laced with malice. “You still think you’re someone.”

His smile thinned, curling upward.",27,118
1pwosot,,"“And I do so love the breaking-in stage.”

With a final chuckle, he released my chin and turned toward the door.",21,119
1pwosot,,"He motioned for Mara to follow him, and she obeyed instantly. “Come along,” he said.",15,120
1pwosot,,"“We have more work to do.”

Mara stepped toward the door, her face empty, devoid of emotion.",17,121
1pwosot,,"Just before they stepped out, he paused, turning to look back at me, as if savoring the moment. “Goodnight, Emily,” he said, his words sarcastically gentle.",26,122
1pwosot,,"The door closed hard behind them, leaving the room steeped in a suffocating silence. From the darkness of Lilith’s cage, her voice whispered, weak and strained.",26,123
1pwosot,,"“Run, Emily… before he learns how to break you.”

[Final Part](",13,124
1pwo2az,My sister said her boyfriend was acting weird. I’m starting to believe her.,"I’m writing this because I’m scared. No, I’m terrified. I’m sitting here in my car, cold, breath trembling. I’ve been in this same spot since last night.",27,0
1pwo2az,,"I don’t know what to do, but I hope this finds you and you find me, before they do.",19,1
1pwo2az,,"Let me start by prefacing this with a little bit of background. I want y’all to know that we’re not crazy. We’re young, a little wild, but not crazy.",29,2
1pwo2az,,"My name is George and I have a twin sister named Gina. Gina is dating my bestfriend since high school, Preston.",21,3
1pwo2az,,"Obviously, I’ve known my sister my whole life and we met Preston at 14. We’re 24 now. We have a close bond, so close that we all live together.",29,4
1pwo2az,,Preston and Gina are both data engineers and I’m a private chef. We live pretty normal lives.,17,5
1pwo2az,,"However, we do occasionally love a little thrill seeking; rock climbing, bungee jumping, skating in empty pools on private property, exploring and tagging abandoned buildings —- you know, things like that.",31,6
1pwo2az,,"It’s a relief from having to be professional all of time. I won’t lie though, I’m starting to regret ever having enjoyed those things. But, that’s enough background.",28,7
1pwo2az,,"I ought to make this quick. Here’s what’s been happening. A month ago, things were normal. It was like any other day.",22,8
1pwo2az,,"Preston and Gina woke up early and ate breakfast at the kitchen table. The smell of eggs, bacon, and maple filled the house.",23,9
1pwo2az,,"It drew me to the kitchen like the sounds of a siren draws a sailor to his demise. I should’ve stayed upstairs, but I mosied on down there.",28,10
1pwo2az,,"I could hear them laughing softly at whatever TikTok video my sister was showing Preston. “Good morning brother.”, Gina’s voice echoed as I bent the corner.",26,11
1pwo2az,,"“Morning y’all”, my voice cracking as I forced a sound from my parched lips. “Food’s in the microwave bro.” Preston, responding to the sound of my stomach growling.",28,12
1pwo2az,,Everything was normal. Everything was as it should be.,9,13
1pwo2az,,"“So, are you taking the job George?” I looked at my sister as she peered at me from over the top of her coffee mug. “Yeah, I think so.",29,14
1pwo2az,,"I mean, I told them yes.”

“I think it’s a good idea.” Preston added. I was offered a job in New York the week before.",25,15
1pwo2az,,"A private chef experience for a couple bougie millionaires. I’d never been to New York, but I’ve always wanted to go.",21,16
1pwo2az,,"The job was three weeks long, or so it should’ve been. It was some kind of rich person’s retreat, dressed up as “fiscal planning”. (Gina) “Well, before you go.",29,17
1pwo2az,,"Let’s all do something together. When do you leave again?”

I should’ve said no. “If I go, Monday.”

(Preston) “That’s two days from now?",24,18
1pwo2az,,"Damn, I didn’t realize it was that soon. We -“

(Gina) “We should go tag that abandoned warehouse we saw the other day!!!!”

“Abandoned warehouse?",25,19
1pwo2az,,"Where?”

(Preston) “Yeah, a few blocks over.”

“No, there’s not.",10,20
1pwo2az,,"I mean I think I would’ve noticed an abandoned warehouse that close to home.”

(Gina) “I mean, we just moved here a month ago and we never really explored the area.",31,21
1pwo2az,,"Feasible that you would’ve missed it.”

(Preston) “Plus, it’s pretty tucked away. It’s like off a side street, almost cul de sac style.",23,22
1pwo2az,,"We only saw it because Gina here made a wrong turn yesterday.”

(Gina) “Whatever, so you down or what bro?”

“Yeah, whatever sure.",23,23
1pwo2az,,"Let’s go tomorrow so I can use Sunday to pack.”

I should’ve said no. My sister let out an excited squeal. The next day it was business as usual.",29,24
1pwo2az,,"Everything was normal. Everything was the way it should be. Me, Gina, and Preston pilled into my Toyata 4Runner.",19,25
1pwo2az,,"The air was familiar, a smell I had grown accustomed to from book bags filled to the brim with spray paint mixed with smell of the twine that built the rope we used for climbing.",35,26
1pwo2az,,I couldn’t tell where one smell began and the other ended. There was an excited energy in the car as Gina pointed out the directions.,25,27
1pwo2az,,"Left, left, right at the light, left on the side street, right down a street that looked more like an alley, drive to the end of the field.",28,28
1pwo2az,,"Preston was right. This was a cul de sac, with a huge empty warehouse at the end. Decrepit. Over-grown.",19,29
1pwo2az,,The trees draped over the building like bags on the eyes of a man who’s lived way past his prime.,20,30
1pwo2az,,"Graffiti lined the building, reminding me of the faded tattoos on my skin. I know this may not make any sense, but the building —- the building almost seemed alive.",30,31
1pwo2az,,"Sad. Forgotten. I parked. We got out the car, book bags, smiles on Preston and Gina. “Y’all sure about this?”

(Preston) “Never known you to be scared bro.”

“I’m not”….",30,32
1pwo2az,,"I was lying. I didn’t know why, but I didn’t want to go in. Maybe it was intuition. Maybe I watched too many scary movies.",25,33
1pwo2az,,"I don’t know, but I must’ve zone out. I found myself standing there alone. Preston and Gina, already in the building, beckoning me forward.",24,34
1pwo2az,,"Each step was heavy, boulders tied to my feet. I took a deep breath and thought to myself. “Man up, you’ve walked into a hundred abandoned buildings.",27,35
1pwo2az,,"This one’s no different. This isn’t a movie, it’s real life.”

Words I regret now. I walked in.",18,36
1pwo2az,,"The air outside was cold, but the air in here was warm, hot even.",14,37
1pwo2az,,"I could feel the house breathing, the warm air moved at a cadence, in and out, in and out, in and out. Before I knew it my breath matched it.",30,38
1pwo2az,,"Hold on y’all, I think I need to move my car. I see people in the field.",17,39
1pwo2az,,"I’ll be back to finish in a moment, but I’ll post this for now. Just in case. ————————————————————————-

It was them.",21,40
1pwo2az,,"My bestfriend and my sister, walking across that field, towards me, expressions empty. I think I pressed the pedal through the floor as I drove out of there.",28,41
1pwo2az,,"In the rear view mirror, I saw them turn around and stare at my fleeing car.",16,42
1pwo2az,,"No smile, no frown, just a blank stare, standing there, watching from where it used to be.",17,43
1pwo2az,,"I know I said, I’d be back in a moment and it’s been hours. But bear with me, I couldn’t stop.",21,44
1pwo2az,,I couldn’t get the image of their faces out of my head. I drove to escape my mind. It’s playing tricks on me. I needed time to collect my thoughts.,30,45
1pwo2az,,"Anyways, I’ll start back from where I was. I promise it will all make sense at the end.",18,46
1pwo2az,,"When I walked in that building, it felt like I walked into the mouth of a beast. It was hot, humid, alive.",22,47
1pwo2az,,"The normal sounds of an abandoned building escaped whatever place this was; no birds, no rats scruffling across the floor, no creaks as we walked through. Complete silence.",28,48
1pwo2az,,(Gina) “Let’s go up there.” She pointed to an empty spot on the wall that had a staircase leading up to it or what was left of one.,28,49
1pwo2az,,“Sure.” I think my voice cracked a little.,8,50
1pwo2az,,"(Preston) “You head up first since the ropes are in your bag, you can tie one up and toss it down for us.”

I should’ve turned around.",27,51
1pwo2az,,"I crept up the stairs, still not a sound. It didn’t creak under the pressure of my steps.",18,52
1pwo2az,,I couldn’t even hear the tap of my foot as I climbed up. Utter silence.,15,53
1pwo2az,,"(Gina) “Hurry up George, you’re moving like a grandpa.”

“Shut up Gina.”, but she was right. Everything in my body was telling me to stop. Walk back down. Go home.",30,54
1pwo2az,,"Instead, I tied the rope around a rail that was bolted to the wall and flung it down. “Here, but I don’t think you’ll need it.",26,55
1pwo2az,,"The steps didn’t give at all when I was coming up.”

(Preston) “You’re right. Easy work.”

(Gina) “Well keep going.",20,56
1pwo2az,,"I want to tag that spot.”

(Preston) “Yeah, we’re going Gina relax.”

We had to walk across a tattered floor, missing half its boards to get there but we did.",30,57
1pwo2az,,Preston and Gina dropped their books bags and started unpacking the cans.,12,58
1pwo2az,,(Preston) “Look alive George” He threw a couple of cans my way and I tripped over a board in attempt the catch them. Fell flat on my face.,28,59
1pwo2az,,I could hear the sounds of my sister’s obnoxious laugh and Preston walked over to help me.,17,60
1pwo2az,,"(Preston) “Damn, you good man?”

“Yeah, I just lost my balance for a moment.",14,61
1pwo2az,,"Shit, it’s a lot going on with this floor.”

(Preston) “Yeah, let’s get this over with”

Preston walked back to his spot on the wall.",25,62
1pwo2az,,"I took a deep breath, shook my can, and sprayed away. In that moment, every worry drifted.",17,63
1pwo2az,,"As I crossed my lines and made my imagination come to life, I lost track of time.",17,64
1pwo2az,,"I forgot where we were and the fear that enveloped me as I walked through this building. I walked through what used to be a door way, continued to tag.",30,65
1pwo2az,,"I was in another world….. until I wasn’t. Crash

My heart dropped as I heard the sounds of boards breaking, my sister screaming.",23,66
1pwo2az,,"I ran back out from around the door way, Preston had fell through the floor. (Preston) “Fuck! Help me out of here.",22,67
1pwo2az,,"I can’t see shit down here.” For some reason, I was froze. My feet wouldn’t budge no matter how hard I tried.",22,68
1pwo2az,,"(Gina) “George, what the fuck!” Gina ran over and yanked the other rope out of my book bag and tossed it in.",22,69
1pwo2az,,"I followed her, wrapped my arms around her body, grabbing the rope to pull it back. (Gina) “Preston! Preston!”

No answer.",21,70
1pwo2az,,"(Gina) “Preston grab the FUCKING rope”

It was a second, a second too long before we felt a tug on the rope.",22,71
1pwo2az,,"I should’ve known then, we should’ve never came here. I walked backwards, my sister following my steps, lifting Preston out of the hole.",23,72
1pwo2az,,"He fell over to the side, covered in filth, clearly annoyed.",11,73
1pwo2az,,"“Preston, how you feel man?”

(Preston) “I’m fine, let’s just get the fuck out of here.”

(Gina) “Yeah, let’s go”

We packed the supplies, untied the rope on the stairs and headed out the building.",35,74
1pwo2az,,"I didn’t say anything, but I was relieved. It was dark now, and I just wanted to get home. The car ride was —- dead.",25,75
1pwo2az,,Preston nor Gina said a word. As soon as we walked in Preston went upstairs and Gina didn’t hesitate when he was out of sight.,25,76
1pwo2az,,"(Gina) “What the fuck was that earlier George?”

“What are you talking about?”

(Gina) “Why did it take you so long to help?”

“I don’t know”

(Gina) “I don’t know?",30,77
1pwo2az,,"You answer is I don’t fucking know?! Unbelievable.”

She scoffed and left me standing there. I don’t know why, but in that moment, part of me wanted to leave him.",30,78
1pwo2az,,Leave him in that hole. Leave him where he was at. We didn’t see each other for the rest of that night and we barely spoke until I left.,29,79
1pwo2az,,Just a few “what’s up”’s in passing. I figured Gina told Preston that I froze and he was pissed at me.,21,80
1pwo2az,,"When Monday came, I slipped out the house early and sent them a text. “Just left. See y’all in a few weeks”

Honestly.",23,81
1pwo2az,,A week and a half had passed since the incident and I hadn’t spoke to Preston or my sister. Being a private chef for the rich was exhausting work.,29,82
1pwo2az,,"I barely had time to talk or text and when I had free time, I slept. But one day, my sister called me.",23,83
1pwo2az,,"(Gina) “George.”, her voice broke a little as she said my name

“Wassup.”

(Gina) “Preston has been acting weird lately.”

“What do you mean?”

(Gina) “3 days ago.",28,84
1pwo2az,,I came down stairs and he was just watching static on the tv. I called his name a couple times. He didn’t even budge.,24,85
1pwo2az,,It freaked me out a bit so I went upstairs.,10,86
1pwo2az,,"I figured I’d ask him when he came up for bed but he never did.”

“Well, did you talk to him about it?”

(Gina) “I tried, but he blew me off.",31,87
1pwo2az,,"He said he woke up on the couch after falling asleep watching tv and maybe it had just went out or something.”

“Maybe it did.”

(Gina) “No, he was sitting up right.",32,88
1pwo2az,,"He wasn’t sleep, he was staring at the screen. Silent.”

“I don’t know what you want me to say Gina.",20,89
1pwo2az,,"Maybe he was just screwing with you.”

(Gina) “He’s been doing it for 3 days straight!”

“Maybe he’s committed to the bit”

(Gina) she was clearly annoyed, “Whatever George, can you just talk to him?”

“Yeah, I’ll talk to him.",40,90
1pwo2az,,"But I’m sure you’re overreacting.”

She was not overreacting. I know that now. I called Preston that day and he didn’t answer.",22,91
1pwo2az,,I shot him a text asking if he was okay. He said everything was fine and I left it there.,20,92
1pwo2az,,"I told myself, I’d call him later but as I said, the job was exhausting. It slipped my mind completely. I never reached back out. 3 days passed.",28,93
1pwo2az,,"My sister called me again. Sobbing. (Gina) “George, please come home. Something is wrong with him.”

“What Gina, what are you talking about?”

(Gina) “Something is wrong with Preston.",29,94
1pwo2az,,"Please, come home. I’m scared.”

“I can’t just leave because you and Preston are in a fight.”

(Gina) “We’re not in a fight. He - He’s different. Every night.",29,95
1pwo2az,,Him and that damn tv. It’s every single night. I find him staring at me constantly. This morning when I woke he was just standing over our bed.,28,96
1pwo2az,,"He was staring at me, no expression at all. Just staring. I don’t feel safe.”

“Then just got to mom and dad’s for a while.",25,97
1pwo2az,,"I can’t come back.” She wasn’t listening. (Gina) “George. There’s something wrong. When I look into his eyes, I don’t.",20,98
1pwo2az,,"George, he keeps going ba——”

I was being called by my party as she was talking. “Gina, I have to go.",21,99
1pwo2az,,"My clients are calling.”

I hung up abruptly and finished my day out. By the time I woke up, my sister had called me 42 times.",26,100
1pwo2az,,"Up until then, I thought she was just being dramatic but as I scrolled through my missed calls —- my heart sank more and more.",25,101
1pwo2az,,"I mean I was sure it was nothing, but I felt obligated to at least check it out.",18,102
1pwo2az,,"That was my sister after all and something, even if it was nothing, had her frightened.",16,103
1pwo2az,,"Against my will, I cut my job short and brought the next ticket back to Minnesota. I called my sister from the airport. “Gina.”

(Gina) “Are you coming home?”

“Yeah.",30,104
1pwo2az,,"My flight lands in 2.5 hours. ”

(Gina) “I’ll meet you there.”

I pondered about my sister’s calls the whole flight home.",22,105
1pwo2az,,"I mean, Preston’s behavior was strange but he wasn’t causing any harm. Maybe I just didn’t understand because I wasn’t witnessing it.",22,106
1pwo2az,,I kept trying to remember what she was saying when I hung up. He keeps going where? My flight landed and my sister quickly found me.,26,107
1pwo2az,,"She was waiting at the baggage claim. “You were just waiting here?”

(Gina) “I told you, I’d meet you here.”

“Where’s your car?”

(Gina) “I ubered here.",27,108
1pwo2az,,"You parked here right?”

“Yeah.”

We walked to my car. Silence filled the atmosphere so thick you could cut it.",20,109
1pwo2az,,She didn’t say another word until we got back into the car.,12,110
1pwo2az,,"(Gina) “He’s been going back there every night.”

“Going where?”

(Gina) “That warehouse.”

“Why?”

(Gina) “I don’t know.”

“Where’s he now?”

(Gina) “I don’t know.",25,111
1pwo2az,,I went to mom and dad’s last night and I hadn’t been back.,13,112
1pwo2az,,"I wasn’t going back until you came home.”

“Okay.”

I didn’t have to tell my sister where I was going. She knew.",22,113
1pwo2az,,We pulled up in the driveway and I felt a lump form in my throat. I walked in and Preston was standing in the kitchen.,25,114
1pwo2az,,"He didn’t even look up when we came in. He just stood there, staring at the counter until his gaze slowly moved up to meet mine.",26,115
1pwo2az,,"I felt violated, like he could see through me. Fully clothed but I felt naked in front of him. His eyes. His eyes were lifeless.",25,116
1pwo2az,,"He seemed a man with no soul, eyes sunken, hair disheveled. It felt like forever passed without him saying a word. “Preston.",22,117
1pwo2az,,"You look like shit.”

He didn’t respond, not even a grunt. He stepped from around the kitchen corner and every bone in my body shook as he walked past me.",30,118
1pwo2az,,"He didn’t acknowledge us. He just walked out the front door, got in his car, and drove off.",18,119
1pwo2az,,"For the love of God, I don’t know why I went after him. We should’ve just let him leave. But I saw the tears in my sister’s eyes.",28,120
1pwo2az,,"She pleaded with me without ever moving her lips. “Come on. We’ll follow him.”

(Gina) “We don’t have to.",19,121
1pwo2az,,"He’s going to that warehouse.”

The sounds of that place made my heart skip a beat.",16,122
1pwo2az,,I immediately recalled our conversation last night and knew that’s what she was trying to tell me.,17,123
1pwo2az,,"This isn’t how I planned to spend my first day back, chasing a guy who clearly doesn’t want to be caught.",21,124
1pwo2az,,"I should’ve told her to just let it go, but instead I sighed, turned around, walked out the door. I could hear her foot steps behind me.",27,125
1pwo2az,,"Another silent car ride, but my thoughts screamed at me. “Turn around. Do not go back to the warehouse.",19,126
1pwo2az,,"Do not step foot back in the building.” With every caution my brain threw at me, I threw a reason back, “That’s my bestfriend. My sister loves him.",28,127
1pwo2az,,"It’s just a warehouse.” But all that reason left as I pulled back up to that place, as I walked up to the front door, my sister clinging to my back.",31,128
1pwo2az,,"Her breath was shaky, I could tell she was scared. We shouldn’t have went in there. We shouldn’t have went after him. It was different this time when we entered.",30,129
1pwo2az,,The silence this place once offered has dissipated. I heard steps coming from upstairs.,14,130
1pwo2az,,"The air moving through the building gave off a soft groan, the type you hear from an animal that hadn’t fed in days but just laid eyes on its next meal.",31,131
1pwo2az,,(Gina) “Is that a rope?” She pointed towards the spot we tagged when we first came here.,17,132
1pwo2az,,"She was right, there was a rope leading directly into the hole Preston fell in before. We should’ve turned around there.",21,133
1pwo2az,,"I walked forward without ever responding; up the same stairs from before but this time they creaked, over the same broken floor boards that squealed with each step now.",29,134
1pwo2az,,"Careful, as I knew my sister was following me. I stopped once we reached the hole. I don’t know why, but I whispered “Preston.",24,135
1pwo2az,,"Yo Preston, you down there.”

A chill went up my spine as I heard his voice, familiar but not quite right.",21,136
1pwo2az,,(Preston) “Down here.” I saw a slight tug on the rope. I shouldn’t have went down there.,17,137
1pwo2az,,"“Stay here and turn the flash light on your phone on”

(Gina) “You’re going down there?”

“Looks like I have to.”

I’m almost certain you could see my heart pounding out of my chest.",34,138
1pwo2az,,What was I even thinking? I grabbed the rope and lowered myself down.,13,139
1pwo2az,,My sister held the flash light over my head but it did nothing to pierce the dark abyss I was entering.,21,140
1pwo2az,,"It felt like forever as I climbed my way down the rope, each drop down my grip loosening up, palms sweating, heart racing. Thud

My feet hit the ground.",29,141
1pwo2az,,"It was pitch black. I fumbled around in my pocket for my phone. I didn’t want to turn my flash light on, but I couldn’t see a thing.",28,142
1pwo2az,,"I should’ve climbed back out. Matter of fact, I should’ve never came down here. Before I could get my phone out of my pocket.",24,143
1pwo2az,,"Thud

I stifled my scream but jumped, fell straight on my ass. (Gina) “It’s me”

“I told you to stay up there. Why did you come down here?!",28,144
1pwo2az,,I thought you were holding the light.” I yelled at her softly.,12,145
1pwo2az,,"(Gina) “I couldn’t let you come alone and I put the phone in my mouth while I climbed down.”

The light, I had never turned my flash light on.",29,146
1pwo2az,,My sister had her flash pointed at me as I finally got the phone out my pocket and hit the flash light switch. I should’ve left it off.,28,147
1pwo2az,,"Nothing could have prepared me for what I was about to see. I saw him. I saw Preston, except, this wasn’t Preston at all. He stood there, staring at us.",30,148
1pwo2az,,He said nothing.,3,149
1pwo2az,,He just tilted his head and for a split second he smirked before he took one step forward and his eyes flashed a pitch black before turning back to normal.,30,150
1pwo2az,,"Gina screamed, Preston or whatever that was ran. I scurried backward until I ran into something. My back hit only what I could describe as a pod.",27,151
1pwo2az,,"It was huge, round, and filled with something akin to amniotic fluid. I whipped my head around, flash light following. I couldn’t wrap my mind around what I saw.",29,152
1pwo2az,,"It was Preston, inside of this thing. I couldn’t hold in my holler as I ran back to my sister. She was on the floor, sobbing. “Get up.",28,153
1pwo2az,,"I found Preston.”

(Gina) shaking her head. “That wasn’t Preston.",10,154
1pwo2az,,"That thing wasn’t Preston.”

“No, the real -“ I didn’t finish my sentence, I just dragged her over to the wall and flashed my light.",25,155
1pwo2az,,"I didn’t know her eyes could get that wide. She immediately began clawing at whatever it was, trying to break him free. (Gina) “Preston. Preston. Preston.”

“Gina, He gon—-“ .",30,156
1pwo2az,,"I ate my words before I could even finish them, he started to move as she started to break the sack. I couldn’t believe it. How was that even possible?",30,157
1pwo2az,,"Before I knew it, I was clawing at it too. The slime running down my hand and arms. My clothes covered in goo.",23,158
1pwo2az,,"(Preston) “huhhhhh” Preston dropped out, coughing relentlessly, hands and knees on the floor. Before I could even say anything to him, I heard my sister scream again.",27,159
1pwo2az,,"“GINA!” Was all I could get out before I hit the floor, my phone knocked out of my hand.",19,160
1pwo2az,,"My side was pierced, something was stabbing me and somebody or something was on top of me.",17,161
1pwo2az,,"(Preston) “Fuck!” Another thud, whatever was on top of me was gone and I could see a light running towards it. Preston was fighting Preston.",25,162
1pwo2az,,"(Preston) “Help George!”

Preston yelled at me, the familiar voice of my friend and I felt around for anything. Anything at all.",22,163
1pwo2az,,"In the dark, I picked up a piece of wood that broke off the floor boards from above. I grabbed it, grabbed my side, stood up.",26,164
1pwo2az,,“Hold him.” I said as I charged forward. The only thing guiding me is the shaky light from my sister’s phone.,21,165
1pwo2az,,"I plunged it right into it, the other Preston, before I fell.",12,166
1pwo2az,,"Preston took over, I could hear the sounds of flesh ripping a part, until the comfort of silence filled the air.",21,167
1pwo2az,,"It stopped moving, I could only assume it was dead. Before long, I felt Preston’s arms wrap around me and he dragged me, directing Gina to the rope. Wait.",29,168
1pwo2az,,How did he know this place so well? How did he regain strength so quickly?,15,169
1pwo2az,,"None of this makes any sense, but in that moment I was grateful for all the things I didn’t understand. I didn’t dare to think it.",26,170
1pwo2az,,"Although, deep down, I knew something wasn’t right.",8,171
1pwo2az,,"(Preston) “Grab the rope George”

I did as he told, every surge of adrenaline running through my body as blood poured out of my side.",25,172
1pwo2az,,I could see my sister’s flash shuffling up the rope.,10,173
1pwo2az,,"Pain surged as Preston tied the rope around our bodies, he gripped me with his legs, and climbed up —- Gina, at the top, pulling us both up.",28,174
1pwo2az,,I had never seen her with that much strength before.,10,175
1pwo2az,,"We made it out that hole but before we left I looked down and saw the flash of my phone still shining upward. In the faint glow, I saw them.",30,176
1pwo2az,,"More pods. More bodies. Eyes fixated as Preston lifted me over his back, carrying me away. “Guys”. I passed out before I could tell them what I saw.",28,177
1pwo2az,,"I woke up in the hospital with stitches, Preston and Gina by my bedside. “What happened?”

(Preston) “You got stabbed with a wooden plank.",24,178
1pwo2az,,"You lost a lot of blood.”

“No. I know that. What the fuck happened to you down there?”

(Preston) “I don’t know, but I saw everything it did.",28,179
1pwo2az,,"I have every memory of its time as me.”

I knew Preston well. He was lying. “What was that thing?”

(Preston) “I don’t know.”

Something in his voice seemed off.",30,180
1pwo2az,,"It was steady, even paced, as if he rehearsed his words.",11,181
1pwo2az,,"I brushed it off but he seemed, too calm after witnessing —— no living through what he just lived through. I would’ve pressed this issue, but….",26,182
1pwo2az,,I just wanted to forget the whole nightmare. I shouldn’t have went back home after that. Went to stay with my parents. I didn’t though.,25,183
1pwo2az,,"Two weeks have passed since I was released from the hospital. I swear y’all, things were back to normal.",19,184
1pwo2az,,We had decided that we weren’t going to mention that place again or speak about what happened. We were never going to go back to that building.,27,185
1pwo2az,,We promised each other we were going to move on with our lives. Everything was normal. Everything was the way it should be. Until it wasn’t.,26,186
1pwo2az,,"Yesterday, I went down stairs to get a glass of water in the middle of the night. I saw Preston and Gina were up, watching static on the tv.",29,187
1pwo2az,,I felt my throat close as I grabbed my keys and walked out the front door. I didn’t even bother getting dressed or putting on real shoes.,27,188
1pwo2az,,I drove straight to that building.,6,189
1pwo2az,,"Left, left, right at the light, left on the side street, right down a street that looked more like an alley, drive to the end of the field.",28,190
1pwo2az,,My mind was in a frenzy…. Who or what have I been living with? So many more questions I dared not to ask myself. I stayed there all night.,29,191
1pwo2az,,"That’s where I began to write this story, moving only when I saw them coming from across the field earlier. Whoever I saw though, that wasn’t Preston or Gina.",29,192
1pwo2az,,"The eyes, the eyes were black. If I can be truthful with you all, I don’t know which is worse.",20,193
1pwo2az,,"The fact that I had been living with them, business as usual for weeks.",14,194
1pwo2az,,"Or the fact that I don’t know where my bestfriend or my sister are because when I went back last night, the building was gone.",25,195
1pwo2az,,It was just an empty field. I think it was the combination of both that prompted me to write about this. Somebody else had to know what’s happened to me.,30,196
1pwo2az,,"My lack of understanding had me driving for hours. And for some odd reason, after it all, I came back home. A sailor returning to his boat.",27,197
1pwo2az,,"I’ve been here for hours now, trying to find the words to finish this story. Wrapping my mind around what’s happened, what’s happening. I can’t make sense of it.",29,198
1pwo2az,,"I don’t think I even want to know anymore. I haven’t moved from my room, but I heard them come inside a while ago. I don’t think I’m scared anymore.",30,199
1pwo2az,,"I’ve accepted my fate or maybe I’m just too tired to fight it. Either way….. Everything felt normal, except, it’s wasn’t. Things were different, but ever so slightly.",28,200
1pwo2az,,"It’s night time and…. Downstairs I smell eggs, bacon, and maple. The smell is drawing me to the kitchen, the siren’s call to my sailor.",25,201
1pwo2az,,"I don’t want to, but I feel the need to go downstairs. I can hear them laughing.",17,202
1pwlj95,I can't ride on the subway anymore,It’s been a year since that day. I don’t go out in public much anymore. Too scared I might encounter one of THEM again.,24,0
1pwlj95,,I am glad I stumbled onto this site. I had no idea anyone else had a similar experience to me.,20,1
1pwlj95,,"Knowing others have seen these, THINGS, has really helped me heal. My family stopped talking to me altogether because of it.",21,2
1pwlj95,,"They pink slipped me into the hospital for a while but because none of the creatures were there, the doctors insisted I was healed.",24,3
1pwlj95,,"That’s how I know it’s not schizophrenia. No one has subway induced schizophrenia, at least, not that I know of. But damn. Have I seen some shit.",27,4
1pwlj95,,"I innocently thought I could take the train at midnight and arrive safely back at my apartment. Instead, I ended up on the long ride home.",26,5
1pwlj95,,I should preface with the fact that I do not like women. I don’t hate them or anything. I just am not sexually attracted to them. Never have been.,29,6
1pwlj95,,I’ve always liked men but my deeply Christian family guilted me out of exploring my sexuality.,16,7
1pwlj95,,"Instead I existed in a stagnant world, having been conditioned by conversion therapy to avoid men but also just feeling nothing when I looked at women.",26,8
1pwlj95,,My parents sadly believed it would “fix” me into like girls. All it did was teach me to hate myself.,20,9
1pwlj95,,"So my flabbers were ghasted when this short ass blond woman kept looking at me. At first I thought, maybe I’m sitting too straight.",24,10
1pwlj95,,"So I crossed my legs and shot her a sassy look. She was unphased. “Bitch do you need something?” I asked, adding a lilt to my voice.",27,11
1pwlj95,,I am not very feminine at baseline but sometimes I perform to prevent misunderstanding. She didn’t say anything. She merely stood up and walked over to me.,27,12
1pwlj95,,"She then sat next to me on the subway seat. I looked around the empty subway car. “Girl, are you for real right now?",24,13
1pwlj95,,"Like you don’t have anywhere else to sit?” I gestured to the open car. She watched my mouth move curiously, her lips attempting to do the same.",27,14
1pwlj95,,A deep guttural noise emanated from her throat. “Guuuuuuuuurl” She rasped. “What the hell. Are you on drugs? Are you a victim of trafficking?,24,15
1pwlj95,,Do you want me to call the police?” I searched in my bag for my cell phone. I couldn’t find it. She watched me curiously and shook her head.,29,16
1pwlj95,,"“Are you like, otherly abled? Like are you deaf or something?” I recognize that despite my best efforts, fear doesn’t always make you the most culturally sensitive of a person.",30,17
1pwlj95,,"This woman was freaking me the fuck out. The longer I looked at her, the more she just looked, not right. I don’t know how to quite describe it.",29,18
1pwlj95,,"Kind of how people in upstate describe those weird mother fuckers, those “not deer”. That is how she looked.",19,19
1pwlj95,,Like if a person was made of ice cream and left out in the sun too long so her features started melting or blurring or something.,26,20
1pwlj95,,"I regretted talking to her at all. Without notice she suddenly grabbed my face, one palm on each cheek and pressed hard. My lips squished into fish lips. She hissed.",30,21
1pwlj95,,"“Say it”

“What?” Panic coursed through my body, but despite my best efforts, I could not break free from this tiny 5’4”, 90 lbs when wet woman.",27,22
1pwlj95,,"How absurd I probably looked, a 6’4” man being forced to do fish lips by this petite frame. Wait a minute, fish lips? I knew this.",26,23
1pwlj95,,"“I’m a little fishie” Her face lit up the minute I started talking. “And fishies don’t smile.” 
 
She nodded with encouragement. I continued “but I do”.",26,24
1pwlj95,,She could barely hiss out the next word “ssssssmile”. I gave my best fishie lipped smile.,16,25
1pwlj95,,She did her best to smile in return but all I got was a toothless window into her esophagus.,19,26
1pwlj95,,"I shuddered and pulled away, blinking back tears of fear from my eyes. She slinked back over to the other side of the car and sat, just watching me.",29,27
1pwlj95,,My mind puzzled as I tried to piece it together. How had she known about fish lips?,17,28
1pwlj95,,That was something my little brother and I had done to each other as kids. I stopped doing it after he died.,22,29
1pwlj95,,I blindly searched my bag with my hand for my cellphone as I watched her carefully.,16,30
1pwlj95,,"Once the subway made the next stop I was getting off and calling the cops. My attempts were fruitless. “Fuck” I muttered. She cocked her head, like a dog listening.",30,31
1pwlj95,,"She stood up slowly and pulled something from her pocket. A cellphone. Wait no, MY cellphone. Why did this bitch have my cellphone?",23,32
1pwlj95,,Without looking she opened it and played the video on the screen. It was a recording of me doing the “I’m a little fishie” bit with my brother.,28,33
1pwlj95,,I was squeezing his cheeks and he was trying to say the lines but kept bursting into giggles. She imitated his giggle.,22,34
1pwlj95,,It was the most horrifying sound I’ve heard in my life. As if a tub of glass and copper pennies tried to sound like a human.,26,35
1pwlj95,,"At this point, I didn’t even care about my getting my phone back. The minute the subway stopped I jumped from my seat and bolted out the door.",28,36
1pwlj95,,"I ran up the stairs from the station and out on the street. From the looks of it, I was a few blocks north of central park.",27,37
1pwlj95,,"I didn’t rest until I reached a bus stop. After I boarded the bus, I sat in the front, near the bus driver.",23,38
1pwlj95,,I made the mistake of looking in his rear view mirror at the sole passenger on the bus. It was that demonic blond lady with her toothless grin.,28,39
1pwlj95,,How the fuck did she catch up with those tiny ass legs? Definitely a drug addict or something with a hyperfixation on me.,23,40
1pwlj95,,At this point I felt like I was stuck in a DARE ad. I got off the bus at the next stop and started running home.,26,41
1pwlj95,,"It wasn’t long till after having run in the dark that I ended up in an alleyway. As I turned around, I saw a tiny frame slowly advancing on me.",30,42
1pwlj95,,I tried to run past her but with the force of some behemoth she shoved me to the ground violently.,20,43
1pwlj95,,The thud of my skull on the pavement sent electrical shocks down my spine. Please don’t be paralyzed I prayed. This woman was trying to kill me.,27,44
1pwlj95,,"As I struggled to catch my breath, she slowly untied and removed my left shoe. “What the hell are you doing?",21,45
1pwlj95,,Why are you stealing my shoes?” I tried to kick at her but she grabbed my ankle forcefully.,18,46
1pwlj95,,She removed my sock and I balked as she shoved my foot into her toothless mouth. I kicked furiously but she withstood it as she sucked on my toes.,29,47
1pwlj95,,"I screamed loudly but at midnight, in the city, no one came to my rescue. As her tongue glided off each toe, she settled on the pinkie toe.",28,48
1pwlj95,,"With animalistic force she chomped down on it rapidly, using only the bone behind her gums to break through my toe.",21,49
1pwlj95,,"I screamed in agony as she severed off my toe. Blood spurt out around her face and on the ground. Satisfied from the toe she had eaten, she slithered away.",30,50
1pwlj95,,I whimpered and attempted to drag myself. My leg was bleeding and I felt woozy. I tore my shirt and poorly wrapped my foot before I passed out.,28,51
1pwlj95,,"My neighbor found me the next day, lying facedown a few feet from our apartment building door. He called the cops who took me to the ER.",27,52
1pwlj95,,"After a blood transfusion, some antibiotics and a boot, I was discharged home. Despite their best efforts, the cops never found the toothless lady.",24,53
1pwlj95,,"I knew they never would because I still see her, outside my apartment window at night, standing on the fire escape. She is no longer small.",26,54
1pwlj95,,She is 6’4” and looks back at me with my face. When it’s quiet I can still hear her through the window repeating her mantra in my voice.,28,55
1pwlj95,,"“I’m a little fishie, and fishies don’t smile, but I do.”",11,56
1pwliom,I Killed My Sister for Clout,I still have the playlist we made on my phone. It is mostly trash 2000s pop and some indie bands she found on TikTok.,24,0
1pwliom,,We used to drive around for hours in my beat up Honda just listening to it. That was our thing.,20,1
1pwliom,,"We would go to the drive thru at Wendy’s, get two Frosties, and just drive until the gas light came on. Katie was cool. She was not just my sister.",30,2
1pwliom,,"She was the only person in the house who actually got it. Our parents were fine, I guess. They loved us. But they were old and tired.",27,3
1pwliom,,They were the kind of parents who fell asleep on the couch at 8 PM and worried about the lawn more than anything else. Katie and I were a team.,30,4
1pwliom,,"When I snuck out to go to that bonfire sophomore year, she stuffed pillows under my duvet to make it look like I was sleeping.",25,5
1pwliom,,"When she failed her math final, I intercepted the report card in the mail and we burned it in the backyard fire pit. We looked out for each other.",29,6
1pwliom,,"We were stuck in the same boring suburb, going to the same boring school, dealing with the same boring people. We survived by making fun of everything.",27,7
1pwliom,,"We had a running commentary on the world. If we saw someone wearing a weird hat, we would look at each other and just know what the other was thinking.",30,8
1pwliom,,We didn’t even have to say it. That is why what I did makes no sense. I look back at it now and I try to find a reason.,29,9
1pwliom,,I try to find some deep dark anger or some hidden resentment. People always want a reason.,17,10
1pwliom,,"The therapists I talk to now, they always dig for some childhood trauma or some sibling rivalry. They want a story where I secretly hated her. But there is nothing.",30,11
1pwliom,,"It was just a random afternoon. Katie had been talking about this guy, Alex, for months. She was obsessed. She wrote his name in her notebook. She knew his schedule.",30,12
1pwliom,,She knew what car he drove. It was honestly kind of pathetic but in a cute way. She was sixteen. She had never really had a boyfriend.,27,13
1pwliom,,She had this idea of romance that she got from movies.,11,14
1pwliom,,"She thought Alex was this deep, mysterious soul just because he wore a leather jacket and didn’t talk much in Chem lab. I knew Alex. He wasn’t deep.",28,15
1pwliom,,He was a stoner kid who played COD until 4 AM. But I didn’t tell her that. I let her have the fantasy.,23,16
1pwliom,,"That afternoon, we were sitting in the living room. She was talking about him again. Wondering if he noticed her new shoes. Wondering if he liked girls with curly hair.",30,17
1pwliom,,"I was bored. That is the only excuse I have. I was bored and I was scrolling on my phone. “I wish I could just talk to him,” she said.",30,18
1pwliom,,"“But I don’t have his number.”

The idea popped into my head fully formed. It wasn’t malicious. It was just… something to do. A way to interrupt the boredom.",29,19
1pwliom,,"“I think I have his number,” I lied. “I think he was in a group project with me last year.”

Her eyes went wide. “Really?",25,20
1pwliom,,"Do you still have it?”
“Let me check,” I said. I didn’t have his number, obviously. I opened the app store and downloaded WhatsApp.",24,21
1pwliom,,I set up a fake account using a burner number app. I set the profile picture to a grainy shot of a guitar I found on Google Images.,28,22
1pwliom,,Alex played guitar. Or at least he carried one around. I created the account. I named it Alex. Then I looked at Katie.,23,23
1pwliom,,"She was staring at me, practically vibrating with hope. “Yeah, I found it,” I said. “Give it to me,” she said. “No, that is weird,” I said.",27,24
1pwliom,,"“If you text him out of the blue, he will think you are a stalker. Let me text him. I will tell him you are cool.",26,25
1pwliom,,"I will tell him to text you.”
She looked at me like I was a superhero. “You would do that?”

“Yeah,” I said.",23,26
1pwliom,,"“I got you.”

I typed a message into the WhatsApp account. I sent it to her real number. >Hey. Got your number from your brother. He said you’re cool.",29,27
1pwliom,,I’m Alex. My phone buzzed in my hand as I sent it. Her phone buzzed on the coffee table a second later. She picked it up. She read the screen.,30,28
1pwliom,,Then she screamed. She literally jumped up off the couch and screamed. She hugged me. She squeezed me so hard I couldn’t breathe. “He texted me!” she squealed.,28,29
1pwliom,,"“He actually texted me!”

I should have stopped it there. I should have said “Gotcha” and laughed and taken the punch to the shoulder.",24,30
1pwliom,,It would have been a funny story. We would have laughed about it at Wendy’s later. But I didn’t. I just smiled.,22,31
1pwliom,,"It felt good to be the one making things happen. It felt good to see her so happy, even if it was fake. “That is awesome, Katie,” I said.",29,32
1pwliom,,"“What did he say?”
She showed me the phone. “He said you told him I was cool.”

“Well,” I said.",20,33
1pwliom,,"“I did.”

The next twenty four hours were a blur of texts. I was texting her from the bathroom. I was texting her from my bed.",26,34
1pwliom,,I was texting her while sitting right next to her on the couch. It was too easy. I knew exactly what she wanted to hear.,25,35
1pwliom,,"I knew she liked indie music, so ‘Alex’ liked indie music.",11,36
1pwliom,,"I knew she wanted someone to listen to her talk about her art class, so ‘Alex’ asked tons of questions about her sketches. I was catfishing my own sister.",29,37
1pwliom,,"And the sick part was, I thought I was being a good brother. I thought I was giving her a confidence boost.",22,38
1pwliom,,"I told myself that when I revealed the prank, she would see that she could talk to guys. That she was interesting. By Friday afternoon, she was in deep.",29,39
1pwliom,,"She was walking around with a goofy smile on her face. She was humming. “He wants to meet up,” she told me Friday night. She was standing in my doorway.",30,40
1pwliom,,"“He wants to grab a burger tomorrow.”

I had sent that text five minutes ago. “That’s cool,” I said. “Are you going to go?”
“I don’t know,” she said.",29,41
1pwliom,,"“I’m nervous. What if I say something stupid?”

“You won’t,” I said. “Just be yourself. He already likes you over text, right?”

“Yeah,” she said.",25,42
1pwliom,,"“Yeah, he does.”

I set the trap. I picked the diner on Main Street. The one with the neon sign that flickered. It was public. It was safe.",28,43
1pwliom,,"It was the perfect stage. “I can drive you,” I offered. “Since mom and dad are going to that dinner thing.”

“You are the best,” she said.",27,44
1pwliom,,She went to her room to pick out clothes. I could hear her opening and closing drawers. I lay back on my bed and opened WhatsApp.,26,45
1pwliom,,">Can’t wait to see you

, I typed. >Me neither

, she replied instantly. I laughed. I actually laughed out loud. It was just so easy. Saturday came.",28,46
1pwliom,,The mood in the house was electric. Katie spent two hours in the bathroom. She borrowed Mom’s perfume. She came into my room to show me her outfit.,28,47
1pwliom,,She was wearing this blue dress she bought with her babysitting money. It had little white flowers on it. She had curled her hair. She was wearing lip gloss.,29,48
1pwliom,,She looked older. She looked pretty. She didn’t look like my annoying little sister. She looked like a young woman going on her first real date.,26,49
1pwliom,,"“Do I look okay?” she asked. She was twisting her hands together. “Is it too much? Should I change?”
“You look great,” I said. And I meant it.",28,50
1pwliom,,"“Alex is going to flip.”

“I hope so,” she said. She took a deep breath. “Okay. Let’s go.”

We got in the car. I plugged in the phone.",28,51
1pwliom,,I put on the playlist. She was singing along to everything. She was tapping her hand on the dashboard. She was glowing. I drove to the diner.,27,52
1pwliom,,"I pulled into the lot across the street. “Go get him,” I said. She unbuckled her seatbelt. She turned to me. “Thanks,” she said. “Seriously.",25,53
1pwliom,,"Thanks for talking me up to him.”

“No problem,” I said. She got out. She walked across the street. She walked with her head held high. She looked confident.",29,54
1pwliom,,I watched her walk through the glass doors. I waited five minutes. I wanted her to get settled. I wanted the anticipation to build. Then I pulled out my phone.,30,55
1pwliom,,I opened the camera app. I hit record. I got out of the car. I crossed the street. I was smiling. I was rehearsing what I would say. Gotcha.,29,56
1pwliom,,Look at your face. You are so gullible. I walked into the diner. The bell above the door chimed. I saw her immediately. She was sitting in the third booth.,30,57
1pwliom,,"She was facing the door. She had a menu in front of her, but she wasn’t reading it. She was checking her reflection in the napkin holder.",27,58
1pwliom,,"She was fixing her hair. She looked up when she heard the bell. Her face lit up when she saw me. It was pure, unfiltered joy.",26,59
1pwliom,,She thought I was there to check on her. Or maybe she thought I was there to say hi to Alex.,21,60
1pwliom,,"“Did you see him?” she asked as I walked up. “Is he parking?”

I didn’t lower the phone. I zoomed in on her face.",24,61
1pwliom,,"I wanted to catch the exact moment the realization hit. “He is not coming, Katie,” I said. She blinked. “What? Is he running late?",24,62
1pwliom,,"Did he text you?”

I shook my head. “No. He didn’t text me.”

I held up my phone. I switched from the camera app to WhatsApp.",26,63
1pwliom,,"I showed her the messages. The blue bubbles. The grainy guitar picture. “It was me,” I said. “I’m Alex.”

I waited for the laugh. I waited for the punchline.",29,64
1pwliom,,"I waited for her to grab a french fry and throw it at me. I waited for her to say, “You ass” and roll her eyes. But she didn’t.",29,65
1pwliom,,The smile didn’t turn into a frown. It didn’t turn into anger. It just vanished. It fell off her face like a mask slipping. She looked at the phone screen.,30,66
1pwliom,,Then she looked at me. Then she looked around the diner. There were a few other people there. An old couple in the corner. A trucker at the counter.,29,67
1pwliom,,No one was looking at us. No one cared. But she looked like she was naked on a stage. She shrank. Physically shrank. Her shoulders hunched up.,27,68
1pwliom,,She crossed her arms over that blue dress with the white flowers. She looked like a little kid who had been told Santa was dead. “Why?” she whispered.,28,69
1pwliom,,"It was such a quiet question. “It was just a joke,” I said. The camera was still recording. “Smile. It is just a prank.”

She tried to smile.",28,70
1pwliom,,She actually tried. Her mouth twitched. It was the most heartbreaking thing I have ever seen. She didn’t say anything else. She just slid out of the booth.,28,71
1pwliom,,"She walked past me. She walked out the door. I followed her. “Katie, come on. Don’t be dramatic.”
She got into the car. She stared out the window.",28,72
1pwliom,,I got in the driver’s side. I was annoyed now. I felt like she was ruining the bit. I felt like she was being a bad sport.,27,73
1pwliom,,"“It was funny,” I said as I started the car. “You fell for it so hard.”

She didn’t answer. She didn’t put her seatbelt on.",25,74
1pwliom,,"She just stared at the passing streetlights. I drove home in silence. The playlist was still playing, but she wasn’t singing anymore. When we got home, I uploaded the video.",30,75
1pwliom,,I captioned it “She actually fell for it.” I tagged a few of our friends. I wanted validation.,18,76
1pwliom,,I wanted people to tell me it was funny so I didn’t have to feel the weird knot forming in my stomach. Katie went straight to her room.,28,77
1pwliom,,I heard the lock click. I went to my room. I refreshed the feed. The likes were rolling in. The comments were starting.,23,78
1pwliom,,">“LMAO look at her face.”


>“That is brutal.”


>“Bro you are evil 💀”


I felt better. See? Everyone thought it was funny. It wasn’t a big deal.",27,79
1pwliom,,"I knocked on her door around 10 PM. “Come on,” I said through the wood. “Don’t be a baby. Everyone thinks it is hilarious.”

She didn’t answer.",27,80
1pwliom,,"I woke up the next morning because the house was too quiet. Usually on Saturdays, Katie was up early.",19,81
1pwliom,,She would be in the kitchen making pancakes or blasting music while she cleaned her room. But there was nothing. No sound. I looked at my phone.,27,82
1pwliom,,The video had over a thousand views. People I didn’t even know were sharing it. I got up. I went to the bathroom. The door was locked. “Katie?” I knocked.,30,83
1pwliom,,"“Hurry up. I need to pee.”
Nothing. “Katie, seriously. Open the door.”

Silence. A heavy, pressurized silence that made my ears pop. I got a penny from my dresser.",29,84
1pwliom,,I used it to turn the lock from the outside. The door swung open. Katie was on the floor. She was curled up around the toilet.,26,85
1pwliom,,She was still wearing the blue dress. There were empty blister packs everywhere. Tylenol. Advil. My dad’s old prescription painkillers for his back. The box was torn open.,28,86
1pwliom,,"The foil was punched out. I laughed at first. A short, sharp bark of a laugh. “Okay,” I said. “You got me. Good one.",24,87
1pwliom,,"Get up.”

I nudged her leg with my foot. She didn’t move. She was heavy. Stiff. I knelt down. I touched her arm. It was cold.",26,88
1pwliom,,"Not cool from the tile. Cold. Deep, radiating cold. Like touching a piece of frozen meat. I grabbed her shoulder. I tried to shake her. Her head didn’t flop.",29,89
1pwliom,,"Her neck was rigid. Her jaw was clamped shut. Her eyes were open, staring at the porcelain of the toilet bowl. They were cloudy. I don’t remember screaming.",28,90
1pwliom,,"But I must have, because my mom was suddenly there. Then my dad. My mom made a sound I didn’t know a human could make. It wasn’t a scream.",29,91
1pwliom,,"It was a raw, animal howl. She fell to her knees. She tried to pull Katie up, but the rigor mortis had set in.",24,92
1pwliom,,"Katie was frozen in that curled up shape. The paramedics came…

Moving her was the worst part. Because she was stiff, they couldn’t just put her on the stretcher.",29,93
1pwliom,,They had to maneuver her down the narrow hallway. They had to tilt her to get her through the doorframe. It felt disrespectful.,23,94
1pwliom,,"It felt like they were moving a mannequin, not a person. I stood at the top of the stairs and watched. I had killed my sister.",26,95
1pwliom,,I had killed her for likes. I had killed her because I was bored. The house died that day. My parents stopped speaking. They stopped eating.,26,96
1pwliom,,"They moved through the rooms like ghosts, avoiding eye contact with me. They didn’t blame me out loud. The police ruled it a suicide. A tragedy.",26,97
1pwliom,,An impulsive act by a teenager. But they knew and I knew. The video was gone. I deleted it that afternoon. But it was too late. People had seen it.,30,98
1pwliom,,"People knew. The funeral was three days later. It was an open casket. I wished it hadn’t been. By then, the stiffness had passed. She looked… soft. Too soft.",29,99
1pwliom,,"The mortician had used too much makeup to cover the gray. Her cheeks were too pink. Her lips were a weird, waxy orange. It didn’t look like Katie.",28,100
1pwliom,,"It looked like a doll that someone had melted and tried to reshape. I stood by the casket and tried to cry, but I couldn’t. I just felt empty.",29,101
1pwliom,,"I felt like there was a hole in my chest where my heart used to be. After the funeral, the silence took over. It wasn’t peaceful. It was heavy.",29,102
1pwliom,,It felt like the air in the house was made of lead. I stopped sleeping. I couldn’t close my eyes without seeing her face in the diner. I missed her.,30,103
1pwliom,,I missed the car rides. I missed the playlist. I missed my teammate. I missed the only person who understood me.,21,104
1pwliom,,I started spending my nights sitting in the hallway outside her room. I couldn’t go in. I couldn’t look at the empty bed.,23,105
1pwliom,,So I just sat against the wall and stared at the door. That is when the sounds started. It began about three weeks after she went into the ground.,29,106
1pwliom,,"I was dozing off, my head resting on my knees. Ding. My head snapped up. It was the specific, tri tone chime of a WhatsApp notification. I checked my phone.",30,107
1pwliom,,It was silent. Ding. It came from inside her room. My heart began to beat like a drum.,18,108
1pwliom,,I knew her phone was in the evidence box at the police station. I knew the room was empty. But the sound was there. Clear as day. I stood up.,30,109
1pwliom,,My legs were numb. I reached for the doorknob. I opened the door. Her room smelled like dust and that cloying floral perfume she had worn that night.,28,110
1pwliom,,The bed was made. The desk was clear. Ding. The sound wasn’t coming from a device. It was coming from the corner of the room.,25,111
1pwliom,,From the shadows between the wardrobe and the wall. “Katie?” I whispered. The shadow moved. It didn’t look like a ghost. It didn’t look like her.,26,112
1pwliom,,It looked like a smudge on a camera lens. A blur of darkness in the shape of a person. It was taller than she was.,25,113
1pwliom,,Darker than the dark around it. It didn’t speak. It just waited. I should have run. I should have woken my parents. But I was so tired.,27,114
1pwliom,,"I was so full of this rotting, black guilt that I just wanted something to happen. I wanted to be punished. “Are you there?” I asked. The shadow didn’t answer.",30,115
1pwliom,,"But a thought appeared in my head. It wasn’t my voice. It sounded flat. Hollow. Like wind blowing through a pipe. “Undo”, it whispered.",24,116
1pwliom,,"“Undo.”

The word echoed in my skull. It wasn’t audible. It was bouncing through my own mind, a thought that was not my own.",24,117
1pwliom,,"I fell to my knees on her carpet. “I want to,” I sobbed. “I want to undo it. I just want things back to normal.”
The shadow seemed to expand.",30,118
1pwliom,,It filled the room with a cold that burned my skin. It wasn’t the cold of the air conditioning.,19,119
1pwliom,,"It was the same cold I had felt when I touched her arm on the bathroom floor. Normal, the hollow voice said. ""We can do normal.",26,120
1pwliom,,"Open the door."" 

“How?” I asked. “Tell me how.”
The door is already open, the voice droned. You opened it when you called for her.",25,121
1pwliom,,"You just have to invite her back in. I wiped my face. I looked at the shadow. It didn’t have eyes, but I could feel it watching me.",28,122
1pwliom,,"It felt like something. I can’t even explain what it felt like. But I didn’t care. “What do I do?”

Tonight, the voice said. Unlock the back door.",28,123
1pwliom,,"Call her name. Want it. “Is it that easy?” I asked. You have to want it more than you want to be safe, the voice said. I nodded. I did.",30,124
1pwliom,,I wanted it more than anything. I spent the rest of the day in a daze.,16,125
1pwliom,,I watched my parents sit at the dinner table and push peas around their plates. They looked gray. They looked like they were waiting to die.,26,126
1pwliom,,"If I brought her back, I could fix this. I could fix them. Night fell. The house went dark. I waited until I heard my parents’ bedroom door close.",29,127
1pwliom,,Then I went downstairs. I unlocked the back door. I turned off the porch light. I sat on the kitchen floor and waited.,23,128
1pwliom,,"Wyatt, our golden retriever, came into the kitchen. He was a good dog. Dumb as a bag of rocks, but loyal. He trotted over to me, his tail wagging.",29,129
1pwliom,,"But then he stopped. He looked at the back door. His ears went back. His tail tucked between his legs. He started to whine. A high, pitiful sound.",28,130
1pwliom,,"“It is okay, Wyatt,” I whispered. “She is coming home.”

Wyatt didn’t look at me. He backed away.",18,131
1pwliom,,"He kept backing up until he hit the cabinets, then he bolted into the living room. I heard his claws scrambling on the hardwood. I sat alone in the dark.",30,132
1pwliom,,"Around 3 AM, I heard it. Knock. Knock. Knock. It wasn’t a hand. It sounded hard. Like bone hitting wood. I scrambled up.",23,133
1pwliom,,"My hands were shaking so bad I could barely grip the handle. I threw the door open. The backyard was pitch black. It was raining. A cold, steady drizzle.",29,134
1pwliom,,Katie was standing on the patio. She looked… small. She was wearing a thick gray hoodie I recognized. It was my old one. She had the hood pulled up tight.,30,135
1pwliom,,"She had a wool scarf wrapped around the lower half of her face. She was wearing gloves. She was shivering. Violent, jerking shivers that rattled her whole body.",28,136
1pwliom,,"“Katie?” I whispered. She didn’t look up immediately. She just stood there, vibrating in the rain. Then she stepped inside. She moved stiffly.",23,137
1pwliom,,Like she was so cold her joints had locked up. She looked like a little girl who had been out in the storm for too long.,26,138
1pwliom,,"“Katie, it is me,” I said. I reached out to hug her. She felt solid. She felt real. But she was freezing.",22,139
1pwliom,,"It was like hugging a snowman wrapped in cotton. She didn’t hug me back. She just stood there, her arms pinned to her sides. “You are freezing,” I said.",29,140
1pwliom,,I pulled back to look at her. The hood shadowed her eyes. The scarf covered her mouth and nose. All I could see was the bridge of her nose.,29,141
1pwliom,,"The skin looked pale, but it was dark in the kitchen. “It is okay,” I said, crying now. “You are home. I fixed it. I fixed it.”

She nodded.",29,142
1pwliom,,"I led her to the living room. She walked with a weird limp, dragging her left leg a little, but I told myself it was just the cold.",28,143
1pwliom,,"She sat on the couch, staring straight ahead. “I missed you so much,” I said. I sat on the coffee table in front of her.",25,144
1pwliom,,"“Mom and Dad are going to be so happy.”

She didn’t answer. The house smelled funny. Like wet dirt and something sweet, like old fruit.",25,145
1pwliom,,"I figured it was just the mud on her clothes. “Say something,” I pleaded. “Please.”

She made a sound. It was muffled by the scarf.",25,146
1pwliom,,"It sounded like a dry wheeze. “Hungry,” she whispered. My heart broke. She sounded so weak. “Hungry? Okay. I will get you something.",23,147
1pwliom,,"I will make you whatever you want.”

I ran to the kitchen. I was manic with relief. She was here. She was talking. It worked.",25,148
1pwliom,,"I pulled out ham, cheese, bread. I started making a sandwich. I was humming. I was actually humming. Then I realized something. It was quiet.",25,149
1pwliom,,"Wyatt usually came running when he heard the cheese wrapper. He was obsessed with cheese. “Wyatt?” I called out. “Come here, boy.”

Nothing. I finished the sandwich.",27,150
1pwliom,,I put it on a plate. “Wyatt!” I whistled. Silence... A cold feeling started in my stomach. Not the good cold of relief. The bad cold of fear.,28,151
1pwliom,,"I walked into the hallway. “Wyatt?”

The door to the basement was cracked open. Wyatt wasn’t allowed in the basement. I walked over. I pushed the door open.",28,152
1pwliom,,"“Wyatt, get out of there.”

I turned on the light. At the bottom of the stairs, there was a heap of golden fur. It wasn’t moving.",26,153
1pwliom,,"I walked down the stairs. My legs felt heavy. “Wyatt?”
I got to the bottom step. It was Wyatt. But he was… something wasn’t…right…
He was torn open.",28,154
1pwliom,,His stomach was gone. His ribs were cracked open like a wishbone. There was blood everywhere. It was pooled on the concrete. It wasn’t an accident. Something had done this.,30,155
1pwliom,,Something strong. I heard a creak on the stairs behind me. I spun around. Katie was standing at the top of the stairs. The hood was down.,27,156
1pwliom,,"The scarf was gone. Her face was gray. Her jaw was hanging loose, unhinged on one side. Her mouth was stained red. With blood.",24,157
1pwliom,,"She was holding the sandwich I made her. She crushed it in her gloved hand and let it drop to the floor. “Still hungry,” she rasped.",26,158
1pwliom,,I backed up until I hit the washing machine. “Katie?” I choked out. She walked down the stairs. She didn’t walk like a person anymore.,25,159
1pwliom,,"She moved like a spider, her limbs jerking and snapping into place. She stopped at the bottom. She looked at the dead dog. Then she looked at me.",28,160
1pwliom,,"Her eyes were milky white and sunken in. “You did this?” I whispered. She tilted her head. Her neck cracked. “Empty,” she said. Her voice was wet now.",28,161
1pwliom,,"“So empty.”

“What are you?” I screamed. “Your sister,” she said. But the way she said it was wrong. It was like she was mimicking a recording.",27,162
1pwliom,,"“You wanted me back.”

“Not like this,” I said. “I didn’t want this.”

She took a step towards me. “You owe me,” she hissed. It wasn’t a threat.",28,163
1pwliom,,"It was a plea. She looked at me, and for a second, the milky film over her eyes seemed to thin. I saw brown underneath. I saw panic.",28,164
1pwliom,,"“It hurts,” she whined. She sounded like a little kid. “It hurts so much. I am so hungry. I am so angry.”
“How?” I asked, trembling.",26,165
1pwliom,,"“What do you need?”
The shadow peeled itself off the basement wall. It stood next to her, tall and jagged. “She needs the source”, the voice droned.",27,166
1pwliom,,"“She is running on fumes. She needs the fuel that burned her out.”

“Me?” I asked. Katie nodded. She reached out a hand. The glove had fallen off.",28,167
1pwliom,,"Her fingers were gray and withered. “Please,” she whispered. “Let me eat. Then I will be whole. Then I will be Katie again.”

I looked at her.",27,168
1pwliom,,"I looked at the dog. “If you eat me,” I said. “You will kill me.”
“Yes,” she said. “Exchange. A life for a life. You took mine.",27,169
1pwliom,,"Give it back.”

She stepped closer. I could smell death on her breath. “I can’t be like this,” she cried. “It is cold. It is dark. Please, brother.",28,170
1pwliom,,"Help me.”

She was using my guilt. She was reaching right into my chest and squeezing my heart. She knew exactly what to say. “If I let you,” I said.",30,171
1pwliom,,"“Will you remember?”

She paused. She licked the blood off her lip. “Yes.”

I looked at her. Really looked at her.",21,172
1pwliom,,"If I let her eat me, I wasn’t saving her. I was cursing her. I was forcing her to live with the memory of tearing her brother apart.",28,173
1pwliom,,"I was turning her into a monster forever just so I didn’t have to feel bad anymore. “No,” I said. Her face twisted. The sadness vanished.",26,174
1pwliom,,The hunger snapped back into place. “Give it to me!” she shrieked. She lunged. She hit me hard. We fell onto the concrete floor. She was strong. Unnaturally strong.,29,175
1pwliom,,Her hands pinned my shoulders. Her jaw unhinged even further. Her mouth was a cavern of red teeth. She snapped at my face. I turned my head.,27,176
1pwliom,,"Her teeth clicked inches from my ear. “Katie, stop!” I yelled. “Look at me!”

She drew back to strike again. “I am sorry!” I screamed.",25,177
1pwliom,,"“I am sorry I wasn’t a better brother!”

She froze. She hovered over me, dripping saliva onto my shirt. She looked down at me. The hunger flickered.",27,178
1pwliom,,The brown eyes came back. She looked at where her hands were pinning me down. She looked at the dead dog in the corner. She realized what she was.,29,179
1pwliom,,"She rolled off me. She scrambled into the corner, away from me. She curled into a ball, hiding her face. “Make it stop,” she sobbed. “Please.",26,180
1pwliom,,"Make it stop.”
The shadow hissed. Do not listen to her. Feed her. “No,” I said. I stood up. I looked around.",22,181
1pwliom,,"My dad’s old tool bench was next to the dryer. I grabbed a long screwdriver. It was rusty, but the tip was sharp. I walked over to Katie.",28,182
1pwliom,,"She looked up. She saw the screwdriver. She didn’t run. She didn’t fight. She uncurled her legs. She opened her arms. She exposed her chest. “Do it,” she wheezed.",29,183
1pwliom,,"I fell to my knees in front of her. The smell of rot and dog blood was overwhelming. “I love you,” I said. “I tried.",25,184
1pwliom,,"I really tried.” I whimpered out with tears rolling down my cheeks. “I know,” she whispered. Her voice was clear. No rasp. No hunger. Just Katie.",26,185
1pwliom,,"“It is okay.”

I put the tip of the screwdriver against her chest. I pushed... It was hard. Her skin was like leather. I had to use both hands.",29,186
1pwliom,,"I had to put my weight into it. She gasped. Her back arched. Her hands grabbed my arms, but she didn’t push me away. She pulled me closer.",28,187
1pwliom,,"“Thank you,” she breathed. Then she went heavy. The tension left her body. She slumped against me. The shadow screamed. It was a sound like a siren dying.",28,188
1pwliom,,"Then the basement light flickered, and the room was empty. I sat there on the cold concrete, holding my sister’s body, waiting for the sirens. That was three years ago.",30,189
1pwliom,,I spent two of those years in a state facility. The doctors called it a psychotic break. They said I dug her up to say goodbye.,26,190
1pwliom,,They said I killed Wyatt because I couldn’t tell the difference between life and death anymore. I let them believe it. I took the pills.,25,191
1pwliom,,I nodded when they talked about “processing grief.” It was easier than trying to explain the shadow man in the basement. I’ve been out for a year now.,28,192
1pwliom,,I live in a different state. I have a job stocking shelves at a grocery store on the night shift. It’s quiet. I like the quiet.,26,193
1pwliom,,"My parents don’t talk to me. I don’t blame them. To them, I’m just the monster who dug up their daughter.",21,194
1pwliom,,I’m writing this because I need to ask a question. I need to know if I’m the only one. That shadow… I don’t know what it was.,27,195
1pwliom,,It wasn’t a ghost. It wasn’t Katie. It was just something bad. It didn’t leave because I won. I didn’t win anything. It left because the show was over.,29,196
1pwliom,,It got what it wanted. It wanted to see how far I would go. But where did it go? I look at people now.,24,197
1pwliom,,"I see the tired lady buying frozen dinners at 3 AM. I see the guy sitting in his car in the parking lot, just staring at the steering wheel.",29,198
1pwliom,,Everyone has something they regret. Everyone has a moment they want to undo. I wonder if it’s watching them too.,20,199
1pwliom,,"I wonder if it’s standing in the corner of your room right now, waiting for you to get desperate enough to open the door.",24,200
1pwliom,,"If you are reading this, and you have a heavy heart… if you hear a voice that sounds like your own thoughts offering you a way to fix things…

Don’t listen.",31,201
1pwliom,,"Just live with the guilt. It sucks, and it’s heavy, but at least it’s yours. At least it doesn’t eat you",21,202
1pwkgmj,"They told me to never go to the peak of the mountain. Today, I figured out why.","I have enjoyed mountain climbing for a long time. I've sought out many of the toughest mountains on this planet, and reached their peak.",24,0
1pwkgmj,,"The thrill and excitement of reaching their peak is the greatest feeling for me. That was, until I decided to climb Mount Corealitus.",23,1
1pwkgmj,,"Corealitus is an abnormally tall mountain for where it is, since the area around it is entirely flat, and it shouldn't be possible for a mountain like it to form where it did.",33,2
1pwkgmj,,"But then again, science can be proven wrong. Once I saw it on a map, I instantly knew I had to reach its peak.",24,3
1pwkgmj,,"It looked suitably challenging, and was tall enough to have an amazing look across the land around it. So, I went to the nearby town at its base to prepare.",30,4
1pwkgmj,,"This town was rather old, dating back to the 1600's. The locals were rather nice to me, and seemed to enjoy my presence. They didn't seem to get many tourists.",30,5
1pwkgmj,,"But, when I told them of what I came to do here, every single person who heard it seemed to either gasp or be stunned to silence.",27,6
1pwkgmj,,"Turns out, the mountain is a major point of superstition due to the amount of reportedly odd phenomenon that occurred there.",21,7
1pwkgmj,,"People have reported a variety of things happening there, from small things such as small, flickering lights in places you wouldn't expect to see them in, to impossible things such as shadows not moving, and reports of long extinct animals living there.",42,8
1pwkgmj,,"Another thing they mentioned was that an odd fog always covered most of the mountain, with the exception of the peak and base of it.",25,9
1pwkgmj,,"This made it all the more exciting to me, as I could hopefully film the journey to see if what they said was true.",24,10
1pwkgmj,,"Many of them said that I should turn back, and never go there, but I refused.",16,11
1pwkgmj,,"If I had the hindsight I have now, I would've gotten the hell out of there as soon as I heard the first rumor about it.",26,12
1pwkgmj,,"Anyways, after the locals realized I wasn't budging about not going, the only thing they said was to go at the crack of dawn, and go as fast to the peak as I could, as to avoid as much phenomena as possible.",42,13
1pwkgmj,,"Almost all of the reports of supernatural phenomena were reported at night, they said. So, I finally started the trek up the mountain, recording anything of interest.",27,14
1pwkgmj,,"At first, it was the average climb. Not too steep cliffs, but just enough so that if you weren't paying attention you would fall.",24,15
1pwkgmj,,"I had no issues until I got about 10% of the way up, when I noticed something.",17,16
1pwkgmj,,"Despite it being about 2 PM, the shadows were at an angle you only see during noon. It was small, but sorta freaked me out. Shadows don't do that.",29,17
1pwkgmj,,"They always follow their strict pattern. I managed to climb another 10%, and then I looked for a place to rest for the night.",24,18
1pwkgmj,,"I found an area large enough for my essentials and a bit more room, so I set camp there.",19,19
1pwkgmj,,"That was when I saw, or more accurately heard, something I thought impossible. The deep bellow of a whale. It was a long, drawn out, and unnerving sound.",28,20
1pwkgmj,,"I was a bit shaken, but slept fairly well. At the crack of dawn, I again set out to go higher. That's when the next oddity occurred.",27,21

""Wha-what??""

""I have never had a guest here for a long time, and have not wanted one for much longer than that.",28,44

As if I was magically bound to those two words, I instantly packed everything and left. My descent was uneventful compared to the ascent.",26,47

1pw9cnr,,"Creeping ever closer to this deer, as though somehow entranced by it, the yearling soon notices my presence, in which we are both caught in each other’s gaze – quite ironically, like a deer in headlights.",36,9

1pw9cnr,,"Having never seen a deer so close before, as, if you were lucky, you would sometimes glimpse them in a meadow from afar, I rather enthusiastically choose to venture after it – now neglecting my original urge to urinate...",39,11
1pw9cnr,,"The reason I describe this deer fleeing the scene as “hobbling” rather than “scampering” is because, upon reaching the border between the campsite and forest, I see amongst the damp grass by my feet, is not the faint trail of hoof prints, but rather worrisomely...",45,12

1pw9cnr,,"The sight of such a thing should make any young person tuck-tail and run, but for me, it rather surprisingly had the opposite effect.",24,20

1pw9cnr,,"it was as though whatever, or maybe even, whomever had separated this deer from its digit, had done so in a snapping of bones, twisting of flesh kind of manner.",30,25
1pw9cnr,,"This poor peaceful creature, I thought. What could have such malice to do such a thing?",16,26
1pw9cnr,,"Continuing further into the forest, leaving the blood trail and severed limb behind me, I then duck and squeeze my way through a narrow scattering of thin trees and thorn bushes, before I now find myself just inside the entrance to a small clearing...",44,27
1pw9cnr,,But what I then come upon inside this clearing... will haunt me for the remainder of my childhood...,18,28

1pw64em,"I Found A Diary In The Woods, Can Someone Please Help Me?","I used to enjoy camping. Going outside and being amongst nature was a true pleasure, something that I would do most weekends, come rain or shine.",26,0
1pw64em,,"I no longer want to do this. Not anymore. I've tried to think, theorise even, about what I have been through. Something rational, something real to this experience.",28,1
1pw64em,,"I just can't. I'm hoping that writing this down might help? Help me process this shit, or at least try to. It happened on Saturday, which was two days ago.",30,2
1pw64em,,"I had gotten up early, hoping to make a quick head start so I would have the rest of the day to do what I wanted.",26,3
1pw64em,,"I had planned this weekend for a couple of weeks now, and finally I had a long weekend to enjoy myself.",21,4
1pw64em,,"I wasn't needed at work on Monday, so it allowed me to spend the next couple of days camping in my local woodland, Tingrass Woods.",25,5
1pw64em,,"Tingrass is relatively small, being only about 15 hectares, but its beauty is unlimited.",14,6
1pw64em,,"Shimmering streams and endless oak trees are some of the more dazzling features in there, however, I personally believed that the old mines surrounding the woods were the spotlights.",29,7
1pw64em,,"Tingrass, like its namesake, used to have tin mining in the area. Tin was the town's livelyhood, and was used often for ""revolutionary"" tin cans.",25,8
1pw64em,,"The majority of men worked down there in those caverns, and nearly everyone who lives in the town today had at least one person in their family tree who mined tin.",31,9
1pw64em,,"However, on the 4th of December 1966, the Shear shaft collapsed and around 20 men were trapped under the roof of the cave that day.",25,10
1pw64em,,"The Shear mineshaft was well-known as the cave with the most amount of tin hiding within it, and so, they mined there the most.",24,11
1pw64em,,"It was thought they hit a supporter beam, and because of the cavern's weakened state, the entire ceiling fell.",19,12
1pw64em,,"The state spent a month trying to get them out, but it was no use. The boulders were too big, and there wasn't much to do anything about it.",29,13
1pw64em,,"At least not in those days. My grandfather was caught in the devestation, and in the end, my father was left with his mother and his two younger sisters.",29,14
1pw64em,,"They're mostly blocked off nowadays, and it's extremely difficult to even reach the entrances due to the rangers patrolling the area all day and night, looking for rambunctious kids wanting somewhere to get wasted or already-tipsy adults hoping to get even more wasted.",43,15
1pw64em,,"However, most people just watch them from afar, creeped out by the things. I mean, the black voids of the openings were definitely unnerving, to say the least.",28,16
1pw64em,,"But, I found an eerie curiosity with them. My grandfather worked in those mines all his life, quite literally.",19,17
1pw64em,,"My dad used to take my brother Tommy and I there when we went camping as kids and told us how, ""our grandaddy used to work day and night in those caves."" It’s part of my family history, and somewhere in that deep dark, my grandfather is lying there.",49,18
1pw64em,,"Dad had never wanted to go down there, though.",9,19
1pw64em,,"He stayed far away from them when camping and if he ever came close to mines, he'd come back home all jumpy, checking every room in the house and hugging my mom, Tommy and I when he saw us.",39,20
1pw64em,,I suppose that strange anxiety is why he taught my brother and I how to get around those woods and to never go in those mines.,26,21
1pw64em,,"I've been tempted, of course, but I've always stopped myself before I ever tried to sneak in.",17,22
1pw64em,,"I didn't want to end up like my grandfather, and so, I avoided going near them for most of my life.",21,23
1pw64em,,"Still, we continued to hike and camp with them in sight, which slightly desensitised my brother and I to their prescence. I don't feel that way much anymore.",28,24
1pw64em,,"I packed enough food and drinks for the next couple of days, organising them in my rucksack.",17,25
1pw64em,,"Beans and noodles would do me fine, and I even brought my portable kettle for coffee. This was a routine packing that I had done many times before.",28,26
1pw64em,,"My tent would be in the left-hand side of my rucksack, with the sleeping bag resting in the middle, on top of the food and water.",26,27
1pw64em,,"On the right would be my GPS, maps, and essentials, like first aid supplies, portable chargers, etcetera. Easy enough to remember, even with my terrible memory.",26,28
1pw64em,,"I set off at eight-thirty in the morning. Riding in my beloved Toyota Tacoma, the roads were thankfully clear. The bright sun shone beautifully over the Montana fields that day.",30,29
1pw64em,,"I took a couple of pictures along the way to send to Tommy, who had moved out of state last year.",21,30
1pw64em,,"He was living the high life at Stanford, lucky bastard. I finally reached Tingrass at around nine-ish. The wind was low, and the late summer sun warmed my body.",29,31
1pw64em,,There were a couple of cars in front of the woodland. At least I wasn't the only one to take advantage of the glorious day.,25,32
1pw64em,,"With my rucksack on my back, I began my trek into the expansive treeline and took a quick look over to the abandoned mines.",24,33
1pw64em,,"There were a pair of rangers trucks parked outside the two quaint log cabins, which were about 150 meters away from the mineshafts.",23,34
1pw64em,,"I recognised one of the trucks parked next the other, the chipped sticker of the Wood Rangers emblem plastered on the door, ""WUTHERS CREEK RANGERS - GUIDE AND PROTECT"" written.",30,35
1pw64em,,"His red dice dangled on the front mirror. Robbie was on patrol that day, usually doing the night shift as well as the day shift.",25,36
1pw64em,,He's my best friend and the only other person apart from myself who knows about what happened. Apart from you guys reading this actually.,24,37
1pw64em,,"I walked through the trees, and followed the Chessock Trail with ease. This trail headed to the middle of the woodland, although I didn't go that far.",27,38
1pw64em,,I waved hello to the odd traveler and showed a young couple where to go to reach the centre.,19,39
1pw64em,,"I continued wandering along the path, aiming to reach Babbler's Brook before ten. Or Brucie's Brook, as my friends and I called it.",23,40
1pw64em,,"My old college buddy Bruce had one too many vodka lime sodas and ended up throwing up in the once-clear water, before quickly falling in and squealing like a little girl at the below-freezing temperature.",35,41
1pw64em,,I still have the video. My timing was somewhat acccurate and I reached the brook at around ten.,18,42
1pw64em,,I slung my rucksack to the large oak tree next to the rushing water.,14,43
1pw64em,,"I stretched and took a deep breath of that fresh air, crisp enough to cut silence itself.",17,44
1pw64em,,"The bubbling of the water, the cheery sing-song of the birds above and the scurrying of squirrels and other little animals along the grassy floor. My bliss. My paradise.",29,45
1pw64em,,"The sun was shining through the bushy leaves of the oaks, providing a large amount of sunlight for the rest of the day.",23,46
1pw64em,,"I spent most of the day there, taking pictures, doodling in my sketchbook and texting Robbie to let him know to drop by whenever he got a break.",28,47
1pw64em,,"I also had to send some emails for work; being an intern has its perks, as well as its major downsides.",21,48
1pw64em,,It was just around four when I headed back to camp.,11,49
1pw64em,,"The sun was still high in the sky, but the shadows told me that darkness would be on its way soon.",21,50
1pw64em,,I chucked my rucksack onto my back and trudged back down the Chessock Trial. I let out a yawn and rubbed my eyes.,23,51
1pw64em,,It was an early start for me after all. I just let my feet take me where they knew to go.,21,52
1pw64em,,I was so away with the fairies that I didn't see the damned black book in my way. Why didn't I move slightly left? Or right for that matter.,29,53
1pw64em,,"I could've missed it and avoided all this shit. Instead, I clumsily tripped over it, and caught myself from falling face-first. I spun around and furrowed my brow.",28,54
1pw64em,,I didn't realise what I'd stumbled on until I squinted at the obstruction in the path.,16,55
1pw64em,,"As if it was placed there, a book was sat on the path, closed and waiting.",16,56
1pw64em,,I picked it up and dusted off any dirt that laid on the dark cover.,15,57
1pw64em,,"It weighed heavily in my hand, which caused me to clutch the thing with two hands. There was no writing on the front, just a plain leather-bound outer cover.",29,58
1pw64em,,"A silky string ran down the side of the pin-straight spine, untattered and a contrasting cream colour. The pages were a slight yellow, colouring the once-ivory edges. I pouted.",29,59
1pw64em,,This wasn't here when I walked this way earlier. Maybe someone dropped it whilst they were walking. It was certainly the most obvious and logical reason. Right?,27,60
1pw64em,,"I blinked, then tucked the tome under my arm, the heaviness made my arm ache as I carried it back to camp.",22,61
1pw64em,,"I had to swap it between each arm to stop them from paralysing from the constant dull pain. Finally, I reached camp. It was a place I knew well.",29,62
1pw64em,,"Here, I knew the way out and the way to the centre, which would take less than twenty minutes for me to reach the entrance if need be.",28,63
1pw64em,,"The sun still hovered above the endless treeline, and showed me how long I had before I was gripped by dark.",21,64
1pw64em,,"Setting up the tent was always a pain in my ass, but I suppose everyone feels that way when putting up the damn things.",24,65
1pw64em,,I was zipping up the doorway to my home for the next couple of days when I first felt sick.,20,66
1pw64em,,"It was a sudden rush of nausea, bile speedily crawling up my throat and the acid sorching the way. I fell onto my hands, knees already crouched.",27,67
1pw64em,,"The sickness reached my mouth before I held it there, and then forcefully swallowed the vile, chunky liquid back down. What the hell was that?",25,68
1pw64em,,"I squatted there a good ten minutes, head pounding like I had smashed my head repeatedly on an iron pole.",20,69
1pw64em,,"By the time my migrane subsided, the sun had dropped, sneaking behind the branches of the mighty oaks. I needed the fire made, and quick.",25,70
1pw64em,,Last time I tried to set a fire in the dark I nearly ended up destroying the whole woods.,19,71
1pw64em,,"""*Don't light a damn fire if you don't know where you're keeping it*."" My father's scolding voice rang in my already pulsing head.",23,72
1pw64em,,"I was drunk and I was also trying to impress a girl I was camping with by showing her my ""survival skills"".",22,73
1pw64em,,"Safe to say, she didn't text me back after that. Fumbling for my lighter, I tried to catch a flame.",20,74
1pw64em,,"I had already set a little bundle of dry branches and leaves earlier whilst I set up camp, so I didn't have to forage for kindling in the twilight.",29,75
1pw64em,,"Luckily, the light caught and a small, popping ember began to rise, before it spread onto each dead twig and mossy green leaf.",23,76
1pw64em,,"I'd need the heat to be warm for the rest of the night anyway. Finally, I took a seat on my camping chair.",23,77
1pw64em,,I had left the book on my bag and I was going to read it after I had my dinner of beans. What a banquet.,25,78
1pw64em,,"However, I had a call from Robbie whilst I was cleaning up and stayed on the phone for the next couple of hours.",23,79
1pw64em,,"I told him to drop by, which he agreed and would arrive later, where he would bring some snacks and beer for us to share.",25,80
1pw64em,,"Yes, I know it wasn't great for either of us to be drinking in this sort of situation, with me being in the woods on my own, and Robbie ""technically"" on patrol.",32,81
1pw64em,,"However, Robbie's dad was the sargent of the rangers, so it wasn't really a fear that he would be fired, and I never drank so much that I wasn't in control of my own actions.",35,82
1pw64em,,"Bruce's late-night bender put me off doing that anymore. The sun's orange and crimson rays bled through the treeline, blackness oozed from the shadows.",24,83
1pw64em,,"I took my last picture for Tommy. He kept texting me about how home was, how mom and dad were, and what his semester at Stanford was like.",28,84
1pw64em,,"He'd met a girl called Martina and they'd hit it off. He was living his life, and I was proud of him.",22,85
1pw64em,,"Leaving home and looking to make your name in the big, wide world was a lot for anyone, let alone a dweeby 18 year old like him.",27,86
1pw64em,,"So yeah, I'm pretty damn proud of Tommy.",8,87
1pw64em,,"He asked me, ""*you seen anything cool out there?*"", before adding, ""*apart from those lame-ass landscapes?*""

I was about to retort, saying something like, ""*Yeah this!*"" and send a crude photo, but my eyes fell on my right side.",39,88
1pw64em,,"It was then that I remembered the book. It was laid on my rucksack, ebony leather became inky in the sunset light.",22,89
1pw64em,,"It would be a while before Robbie made his way over, so I thought ""why not?""

I picked it up for a reason.",23,90
1pw64em,,"I sent a photo to Tommy, and I put ""*Found this thing on my way back from Brucie's Brook.*""

He came back to me, ""*What is that?",27,91
1pw64em,,"Is it the Death Note or some shit?*""

""*No idea, just found it in my path coming back, it wasn't there before tho?*""

The little bubble popped up, then dropped, then came back again.",34,92
1pw64em,,"""*Holy shit it IS! Bro who you killing first? I know you want to, you psycho.*""

I rolled my eyes.",20,93
1pw64em,,"I took Tommy out for a drive when he was a kid, just after I passed my test, and a squirrel was hiding behind the car's back left wheel and when I had to reverse out the driveway I squashed the poor thing.",43,94
1pw64em,,"Unfortunately, Tommy and I went out to check and the dumbass screamed so loud it rattled all the windows in the neighborhood.",22,95
1pw64em,,"A little pool of blood surrounded the flattened mammal, its splayed out position and crushed head made its eyes pop. Poor fella. I felt terrible, but Tommy was distraught.",29,96
1pw64em,,The only way I could get him into the car was to promise to take him to McDonald's after our drive.,21,97
1pw64em,,"He was 12 at the time, and he still goes on about it now. ""Caused him trauma"" apparantly.",18,98
1pw64em,,"I texted back that he needed to get a life apart from consuming anime in his every waking moment, and looked over at the book once more.",27,99
1pw64em,,"Tommy sparked my imagination. Someone dropped it. Surely. ""*Well?",9,100
1pw64em,,"What's in it?*""

I read the message before I placed my phone on the seat next to me and reached over to pick the book up from my bag.",29,101
1pw64em,,"Whilst I ran my fingers along the smooth spine, my phone buzzed again. I took no notice. I just stared at the black tome weighing down my hands.",28,102
1pw64em,,"Lifting up the hard cover, I took a peek at the first crispy yellowed page. It was blank, except for a date written in scratchy handwriting. 30th November 1966. 1966?",30,103
1pw64em,,"What? This was a joke, I thought. It had to be. It must have been some kids scaring people.",19,104
1pw64em,,"Something black covered a large area in the middle, like how a government organisation removed names and used black blocks on hidden files. It was more accidental though?",28,105
1pw64em,,"It reminded me of spilt ink. I flipped to the next page. This showed a diary entry, written on the next date.",22,106
1pw64em,,"This isn't the entire entry, rather a summarized version, as this would be easier to read. *1st December 1966.*

*Lewisham has been speaking to everyone about the mine's infrastructure.",29,107
1pw64em,,"He's jabbering on about the creaking, the creaking from above. Management's been to have a look and they've found nothing.",20,108
1pw64em,,"So what the hell is he going on about?*

*I spoke to Tim and he doesn't hear nothing.",18,109
1pw64em,,"I don't think Lewisham is made for this, after all if he's worried about the sounds these caves make, what is he even doing here? It's a mineshaft.",28,110
1pw64em,,"Honestly, the kids they get these days. Mind you, it's better than the new machines they're looking about bringing in.",20,111
1pw64em,,"They're taking our damn jobs.*

*How will I pay the taxes, hell, even for the presents this year if they cut me?",22,112
1pw64em,,"Peggy will have to try and pull the weight too, bless her. I cannot put this pressure on her.",19,113
1pw64em,,"I will be the indispendable tool for them, so they can survive. I must be valuable. For them.*

I flip over the page to the next entry.",27,114
1pw64em,,"*2nd December 1966.*

*The rest of the boys are starting to hear something from above.",15,115
1pw64em,,"I strain to hear things, although I do hear something.*

*Extremely quiet squeaks come from the ceiling. I can't let it detatch me from my work, unlike Lewisham.",28,116
1pw64em,,The man's going mad. He grabbed me today whilst I was pushing the trolley.,14,117
1pw64em,,"His eyes were red and dry, very wild and twitching.*

*He says, ""Do you hear it, my friend?""*

*I squinted at him and asked what he meant.*

*He replied, ""The - (this bit was scratched out and I was unable to read it) - can't you hear it?""*

*I stared at him for a while and shook my head.",59,118
1pw64em,,"Something wasn't right with that boy. However, I now worry, he may be right.",14,119
1pw64em,,"Whether the sound is what he says it is, I sincerley hope it is a wild fantasy of his, rather than one of fact.",24,120
1pw64em,,"He warned me of the terror to come, lest we leave this cavern. I didn't see him for the rest of the day after that.",25,121
1pw64em,,"He knows something, and I'm afraid I know it too.*

Entry three changed the format slightly. More snappy and direct, almost rushed. *3rd December 1966.*

*I feel the shakes.",29,122
1pw64em,,"I feel the aches. It is creaking, and the boys know it. We have appealed to management to have a simple review of the shafts above. Denied.",27,123
1pw64em,,"They make us think we are stupid. We are imagining things. Fools.*

*Lewisham has since handed in his resignation.",19,124
1pw64em,,He cannot go near the shaft without shaking like a leaf or turning white. Management call him a coward. To make us stay here.,24,125
1pw64em,,"They care not for any of us, just tin. The damned tin.*

*The darkness groans and it moans. It wants us gone.",22,126
1pw64em,,"We all know what Lewisham meant.*

*A source within the Earth has controlled them. Money shall enslave them to enslave us. Always.*

The final entry reads as follows.",28,127
1pw64em,,"*4th December 1966.*

*The men have bolted from the place. Many have lost jobs. I have stayed. Not for my own greed, but for my wife and children.",28,128
1pw64em,,"Peggy's boss will not pay her more. They will not grant her the money she deserves, and so, she is forced to work twice as hard for half the pay.",30,129
1pw64em,,"My darling Peggy. She should not have to endure this.*

*I am at work, not of my own violition.",19,130
1pw64em,,"The mouth of the mine is darker today, and it churns my stomach. It was deep black, welcoming me. Begging and coaxing me to take the plunge.*

*I must.",29,131
1pw64em,,"I must.*

*The aches and groans are almost ridiculously loud now.*

*It is in pain, we have taken too much.*

An icy hand brushed the back of my neck, long fingers raked the skin.",34,132
1pw64em,,"My eyes widened and I stopped breathing. It was barely noticable but it was too cold to ignore. As soon as it stroked my skin, it disappeared.",27,133
1pw64em,,"I held my breath until I could no longer, wheezing and spinning my head around to see who, or what, that was. Nothing.",23,134
1pw64em,,"Just my tent and the vastness of the woodland. Even though I've had time to think about this, I couldn't explain what that was. At all.",26,135
1pw64em,,It was silent and chilly. The sun was long gone and the fire had nearly finished dying. My phone was dead. I don't know how long I was there for.,30,136
1pw64em,,I don't even know how I read anything in that light. It hurt to blink. It took around twenty blinks before they began to lubricate with tears again.,28,137
1pw64em,,"Then, I realised something. I didn't know where I was. I am being fully serious here, I had no idea where I was or why I was there.",28,138
1pw64em,,"What brought on this random amnesia? Only God knows. Looking back, it had to have been because of that diary.",20,139
1pw64em,,"I mean, how else would I forget a place that I had been going to for over a decade?",19,140
1pw64em,,"All I had was my tent, so I switched on my lamp and reached for my equipment. I was not spending my time outside, not any longer.",27,141
1pw64em,,"Before I put out the fire I made sure to have a long look at the abyss, and found nothing.",20,142
1pw64em,,"Still, whilst I chucked my bag into the tent, I kept taking quick glances, checking for anything skulking around in the treeline. Nothing came like before, thank God.",28,143
1pw64em,,"I wouldn't know anyway. The light made it impossible to see anything. I zipped up the door and huddled in the corner on my sleeping bag, then rubbed my neck.",30,144
1pw64em,,It was still bitterly cold to the touch. It was so cold I swear it burnt my hand.,18,145
1pw64em,,"I dipped into my bag and retrieved my portable charger, before I quickly plugged the wire into my powerless phone.",20,146
1pw64em,,"I had a while to wait before I could use it with good charge, and I knew that. I think that's why my eyes stared at the diary.",28,147
1pw64em,,"Dazed, I watched as my hands picked up the book again, and they slowly opened to the diary entry I left off from. It was covered in ink.",28,148
1pw64em,,The rest of the passage was blotted out. I swear there was writing there. There was writing there before. I stared at the black puddle in disbelief. This wasn't right.,30,149
1pw64em,,I flipped to another page. Then another. Then another. All were a dried black mess. All apart from the second to last page.,23,150
1pw64em,,Thinking about this even now makes my neck hairs prick up and my stomach drop.,15,151
1pw64em,,"It was completely plain, no ink was on the page, except for the scrawled words:

""*It no longer whispers.",19,152
1pw64em,,"It screams.*""

The world went blurry after that, and a growing ringing, no, rumbling climbed in volume.",17,153
1pw64em,,"It rang loudly in my ears, so much so, I dropped the diary and clasped my hands over my ears.",20,154
1pw64em,,"It didn't stop it, and instead made it louder by adding distant male screams to the caucophony. That hideous din, the fear, the destruction.",24,155
1pw64em,,"I felt it all, bones rattled under my muscles, almost trying to escape the sounds by jumping straight out of my skin.",22,156
1pw64em,,"I squeezed my eyes shut, tears streamed down my cheeks and my body vibrated, as I know believe I was screaming and sucking in ragged breaths when my lungs ran out of air.",33,157
1pw64em,,"I could hear things wiping their hands against the fabric of the tent, like they were trying to claw their way in.",22,158
1pw64em,,"They were slow at first, and then they became more insistant, more furious. Feet began to join the constant racket, stomping and running around me, all were frantic and disjointed.",30,159
1pw64em,,"It was like hundreds of men were fleeing from some sort of monumental force. My eyes, although closed, saw things.",20,160
1pw64em,,"Flashes of men running for their lives in the dark, their dirty faces had stretched their eyes and mouths wide, illuminated by the weak parafin lanterns dotted around the cracked walls.",31,161
1pw64em,,"These visions would happen for such a short amount of time, I couldn't even remember how many went past my quivering eyelids, and soon it became a frenzied nightmare.",29,162
1pw64em,,"They were all from different perspectives, some of the later ones would even be from a third person perspective; a fly on the wall in this horrific desolation.",28,163
1pw64em,,"Men had their strong bodies contorted into malformed postions, with their limbs crooked and bent at aggressive angles.",18,164
1pw64em,,Pops and cracks were often heard along with squishing sounds like raw meat hitting a hard surface.,17,165
1pw64em,,"Eyes bulged and stared at the midnight sky, as they gawped at the giant chunks of charcoal stone which plummeted towards them, and entrapped them in the perpetual blackness.",29,166
1pw64em,,These unlucky men cried for their families. They howled for their brothers and sisters. They wailed for their mothers and fathers. God it didn't stop.,25,167
1pw64em,,"The things begged for their wives and mothers to help them. Help which would never come. They were abandoned. They were dead, and they knew this.",26,168
1pw64em,,They knew they were bound to their torment. They could not accept it.,13,169
1pw64em,,"The shouting grew, and broke into a swirling clamour, whines and moans of pain added to the horrid collection of voices. It was ear-splitting.",24,170
1pw64em,,"Pure inexplicable dread filled my stomach and spread to my mind, as I felt my lungs squeeze inwards and forcibly push the clean air out of them.",27,171
1pw64em,,"All I could do was cough. All I could do was shake. All I could do was scream. There was no running, there was no hiding, just death.",28,172
1pw64em,,"I could smell it in the air, as rot and decay were now in every breath I took. I can't even describe what it tasted like.",26,173
1pw64em,,"It was heavy and putrid, with hints of a chalky aftertaste.",11,174
1pw64em,,The best way I could describe it would be when Robbie and I went on a walk together in Tingrass when we were young.,24,175
1pw64em,,There was a horrible smell in the air and we both immediately inhaled it. We walked towards the smell by following our noses.,23,176
1pw64em,,I can remember how Robbie vomited his mom's lunch onto the floor when we found out what it was. It was a deer carcass.,24,177
1pw64em,,"A huge stag was laid on its side, and its crimson ribs were exposed to the sky.",17,178
1pw64em,,"The guts of the animal had been removed, as well as the lungs and diaphragm. The same applied for the kidneys and the liver.",24,179
1pw64em,,The most vile thing about it all was its head. It's eyes were rolled back into its skull and left the jellied sockets wet with dark blood.,27,180
1pw64em,,"I could see a couple of white maggots crawling around, eager for sustinance. There was also an attempt to break into its head and squeeze out the brain.",28,181
1pw64em,,"Whatever had scratched off the outer skin had failed, and the cracked pink bone was shown.",16,182
1pw64em,,"Mountain lions weren't often seen around these parts, which is ironic because Mount Wuthers was literally right next to our town, so it was odd to see an animal this brutally attacked.",32,183
1pw64em,,"Rather stripped for parts. The stench was scarily close to what I had smelt in the tent, like I was sat in the corpse of that deer.",27,184
1pw64em,,"Suddenly, scratches cut through the hellish sounds. They stopped in an instant and I felt something warm drip down my nostrils and eyes. The men, I thought, wanted me.",29,185
1pw64em,,They were going to punish me for reading that evil tome. I forced my eyes open and I stared at the crouched figure which prodded at my flimsy tent door.,30,186
1pw64em,,I shoved my hand into my bag and pulled out my hunting knife. I brandished the blade and held it close to my chest.,24,187
1pw64em,,"Then, with trembling hands, I reached for the zipper, knife prepared to plunge into the foul creature that groped at my door. ""Matt, it's Robbie! Let me in!""

Robbie.",29,188
1pw64em,,He wasn't supposed to be there until ten. It could've been anything out there.,14,189
1pw64em,,"For all I knew, that could've been one of those perished men who wanted to use me to bring their decimated corpses back to life.",25,190
1pw64em,,"I blame my knowledge on local folk tales and also the fact I just had a horrific experience that I felt the need to ask him:

""If you're really Robbie, what did you buy me for my eighth birthday?""

Silence.",40,191
1pw64em,,"""What?""

""You heard me, what did you buy me for my eighth birthday?"" I asked him again. Silence once more. ""I got you a Lego Batman building set?",28,192
1pw64em,,"The Arkham Asylum one.""

Shakily, I opened the flap, my hands shook whilst pulling up the zipper.",17,193
1pw64em,,"Surely enough, there Robbie was squat, dressed up in his ranger's uniform and holding a shotgun in one hand, with a lit flashlight in the other.",26,194
1pw64em,,"I genuinely thought he was one of the dead men in the mineshaft. My mind grew dull and my ears heard a high-pitch squeal, something like tinnitus.",27,195
1pw64em,,"His look of concern grew into one of shock and horror, ""Matty, what the fuck happened to you?""

I just sat there dumbly, and so, he slowly began to reach his hand out to touch my shoulder.",37,196
1pw64em,,He was warm. I was not. He pulled me out the tent gingerly as if I was a wild animal.,20,197
1pw64em,,"I don't remember much, only that Robbie had picked up my phone and we had made it to the cabins that the rangers use for their night rounds.",28,198
1pw64em,,"He spoke to me, asked me questions. I couldn't answer him. My throat was torn and when I finally came to, the pain made it impossible to even breathe.",29,199
1pw64em,,"I sat on Robbie's bed, a quilt wrapped around my shoulders.",11,200
1pw64em,,"He stayed with me for a while and told Tina, the other ranger on watch that night, that I had came down with a cold and I was going to spend the night in the warmth and head home in the morning.",42,201
1pw64em,,She brought me a cup of lemon tea for my throat and gave me a pitiful smile before she left to keep watch.,23,202
1pw64em,,"Robbie wiped my nose with a tissue, and when he pulled it away to get a fresh one, I saw the blood soaked into the crumpled paper.",27,203
1pw64em,,"Robbie gave me two twisted up corners of a tissue and instructed me to put it up my nose, as it was still bleeding.",24,204
1pw64em,,"He then handed me my phone with a grimace and told me, ""You should probably text Tommy.""

When I looked at my plugged in phone, I had 15 texts and 3 missed calls from Tommy, as well as 9 texts and 11 missed calls from Robbie.",46,205
1pw64em,,How long was I out? Who knows.,7,206
1pw64em,,"Tommy kept on texting me, ""*Hello?*"" and ""*This is a shitty joke Matt*"" and most disturbingly, ""*Stop it!*""

I had sent him pictures, about fifty, all of the diary.",29,207
1pw64em,,"They were of the front cover, the pages, the back cover, all of it.",14,208
1pw64em,,"I had even taken pictures of the woodland, although you couldn't see much, as they were either blurry or pitch-black. I had done the same to Robbie.",27,209
1pw64em,,"He was obviously worried and confused, and had set off to come and help me. I then registered that I didn't know where the diary was.",26,210
1pw64em,,"I prayed and hoped that Robbie left it behind, and didn't bring that wretched thing with us. I quietly murmured, ""Did you bring the book here?""

Robbie pulled a face.",30,211
1pw64em,,"""Dude, what are you talking about?""

""The black book! It should've been on my right side, or my left?"" My voice was nervous and, even worse, desperate.",27,212
1pw64em,,"He looked me dead in my eyes and told me:

""Matt, I didn't see a book there.""

What the hell did that mean? How?",24,213
1pw64em,,I still don't know the answer to that even now. My eyes stung. The damn thing evaporated into thin air.,20,214
1pw64em,,"Robbie noticed my distress and asked softly, ""What happened to you?""

I told Robbie everything, all with a raspy voice and taking sips of the scalding hot lemon tea.",29,215
1pw64em,,I showed him the pictures and my texts from Tommy.,10,216
1pw64em,,"After I had finished, Robbie stared intently at the floor for about two minutes, eyes flickered from one side of the wood to the other.",25,217
1pw64em,,"The air was tense and I felt like we had been sat like that for an eternity. Eventually, he took a deep breath in, and faced me.",27,218
1pw64em,,"He believed my story, he just couldn't fully process everything yet, which I fully accepted.",15,219
1pw64em,,"I couldn't even wholly remember this situation myself, so I can't even comprehend what he thought of all this. Robbie took the couch that night and gave me the bed.",30,220
1pw64em,,I would occasionaly hear him get up and leave to check on Tina and actually do his job.,18,221
1pw64em,,"When Tina was done on her shift, she came into the cabin and got some shut-eye herself. She was probably told by Robbie to stay there for the night.",29,222
1pw64em,,"The reason was most likely in case something happened to me again, and that he was spooked by the whole incident so he kept Tina close.",26,223
1pw64em,,"I came home yesterday morning when Robbie finished his shift. He let Tina go home first, we both bid her farewell and saw her drive away in her truck.",29,224
1pw64em,,I certainly felt better than the night before and I told Robbie that I would be fine driving home on my own.,22,225
1pw64em,,"He reluctantly agreed, but he wanted to come with me to get my stuff and my truck.",17,226
1pw64em,,He watched me like a hawk the entire way there and walked just behind me for the whole trek.,19,227
1pw64em,,"We packed up my tent, kicked away my old fire kindling and sorted out my bag that I had left overnight. Thankfully, nothing was stolen.",25,228
1pw64em,,"It was just like how it was last night. The only thing missing was the diary, which I hoped stayed gone forever.",22,229
1pw64em,,There was no birdsong or any squirrels that chased each other in the trees. There weren't any people who walked by or distant chatter either. It was just dense silence.,30,230
1pw64em,,"It hung so heavily in the air, almost like a bomb had gone off and erased all life from the area.",21,231
1pw64em,,"I was stunned by how unusually still the woods was that morning, and I could tell it unsettled Robbie.",19,232
1pw64em,,"He just stifly put things away and stayed quiet, much like me. We wanted to get out of there.",19,233
1pw64em,,"Strangely enough, the further we left the camping spot, the more alive the woods became. Sparrow chirps and fellow travellers returned, which eased us both.",25,234
1pw64em,,We reached the entrance and hauled my stuff into the back of the Tacoma.,14,235
1pw64em,,"I thanked Robbie for all his help and opened the door to my truck, before I hopped in.",18,236
1pw64em,,"As I was about to say goodbye to Robbie, he held the door window and his dark eyes stared straight into my soul.",23,237
1pw64em,,"""Call me if anything else happens, m'kay?"" It was more of an order than a request. I nodded, started up my truck and drove home. Yesterday, nothing really happened.",29,238
1pw64em,,Robbie came over to check up on me anyway just to see how I was doing.,16,239
1pw64em,,"I kept all the lights on upstairs when I went to bed though, I didn't want to be left in the dark again.",23,240
1pw64em,,I slept like a log for most of the night. I only got up once.,15,241
1pw64em,,It must've been some sort of primal instinct because when I opened my eyes I felt as though I was being watched.,22,242
1pw64em,,It was like all the hair on my neck shot up and a hard lump weighed in my throat. I sat up slowly and observed the room.,27,243
1pw64em,,Everything still looked the same - all the lights were on and my door had remained closed.,17,244
1pw64em,,"I grabbed my hunting knife and checked the house to ease my racing mind. I found the house identical to how I left it, not thing out of place.",29,245
1pw64em,,The feeling then drifted away and I dragged my weary body back to bed. I can't tell you what happened that night. I seriously don't know.,26,246
1pw64em,,"Part of me feels like it was some kind of bizarre hallucigenic seizure, or just an odd dream. But, part of me knows that was real. It was fucking real.",30,247
1pw64em,,"More real than reality. Something happened to me that night and it wasn't normal. Hell, even Robbie knows that and he's not the biggest believer in the supernatural.",28,248
1pw64em,,"And you know what, neither was I. Not until that night or until today.",14,249
1pw64em,,"You see, at around noon I made myself a coffee and looked through some emails to prepare myself for the meeting I have tomorrow.",24,250
1pw64em,,I left the living room for five minutes. Five fucking minutes. Nothing could've happened in that time.,17,251
1pw64em,,"No one, even if they squatted in that room for days, could've done anything. It simply wasn't possible. I would have heard them.",23,252
1pw64em,,"So you can imagine the absolute scare I had when I saw that diary laid on my coffee table in front of my laptop, wide open with the string running down the crack in the book.",36,253
1pw64em,,"It was acting as a mocking bookmark, almost like it was doing me a sick favour.",16,254
1pw64em,,"It reads:

""*5th December 1966.*""

That is why I have decided to write this down. I need to prove to myself that I'm not crazy and I need assistance.",29,255
1pw64em,,"Someone, anyone, can you help me? I don't know what this thing is and I want, no, need this thing gone. Please, I need knowledge on this thing.",28,256
1pw64em,,As I write this I keep looking over to it. Writing keeps appearing on the page everytime I look back.,20,257
1pw64em,,It's filled one page now and looks like it's going to start the other.,14,258
1pw64em,,"It presses me to read the next entry, and I'm scared that I feel a sense of eagerness to comply.",20,259

The game looked like a Rpg similar to Pokemon from what i saw form the screenshots on the back.",37,7
1pw3q6d,,"But the weurdest thing was it was labeled to have released in 2004 , I was Born in 2006. How could this game exist?",24,8
1pw3q6d,,had i copied the story and forgotten?. I had to get answer so i bought the game (5 chf pretty cheap).,21,9

1pw3q6d,,"Anyway,perhaps youve forgotten the rules of this game allow me to explain"".",12,14
1pw3q6d,,The game from there is pretty diffrent than the one on the back of the box its like a rogue like where you collect cards or aditional boons and all the while youd fight smaller scaled down duels of Legends of the ancients fights.,44,15
1pw3q6d,,I saved after a bit and put the game down but i havent been able to get it off my mind. Why does this game exist?,26,16
1pw3q6d,,HOW does this game exist? Did i create Orchid? Did i steal it and not Realise? Why is the game so diffrent than whats on the Box? And Mattheo...,29,17

1pw33px,,"Being as lucky as I am, I had one of those moving into the apartment right above mine at the start of October.",23,1
1pw33px,,It was a lady who seemed to have an endless supply of worldly goods that all needed to be put into place the moment she moved in.,27,2
1pw33px,,"Every single evening, at 9 pm exactly, she would start either hammering away, drilling the walls, or pushing furniture across her floor, always managing to reach the noise level of an angry bull in heat.",35,3
1pw33px,,"I have always had quite sensitive ears, so I’m no stranger to being awake at night because of bothersome noises.",20,4
1pw33px,,"There is always noise in the city, whether from drunkards singing at the top of their lungs or nocturnal critters running amok in the streets.",25,5
1pw33px,,"Trust me, the sheer number of times I’ve been woken up by an opossum knocking over a trashcan outside my window is ridiculous.",23,6
1pw33px,,"The thing is - these disturbances would always be occasional and brief; whenever they occurred, I could easily fall back asleep afterwards.",22,7
1pw33px,,"But ever since the day that lady moved in, the night has been filled with constant sounds of her mayhem.",20,8
1pw33px,,The cacophony upstairs would go on every evening for about 3-4 days in a row.,15,9
1pw33px,,"Then, at some point, I would hear a large thudding sound, indicating that she had brought out yet another box full of stuff that needed to be set up.",29,10
1pw33px,,This routine sent me into a hellish cycle of exhaustion: I would fall asleep late and wake up exhausted in the morning.,22,11
1pw33px,,"I would then have to drown myself in coffee and go to work, hoping that I could get some sleep later in the evening.",24,12
1pw33px,,Don’t tell me that I just should’ve confronted her. I didn’t want her to think that I was just some cranky old man.,23,13

1pw33px,,"I also didn’t know her name, which I felt would have made the interaction even more unbearable. I just sat on my couch, waiting for the commotion to stop.",29,15
1pw33px,,"Suddenly, three weeks had passed, and she showed no signs of being finished unpacking.",14,16
1pw33px,,The seeds of chaos were planted as the clock struck 9 pm on an unusually hot evening late into October.,20,17
1pw33px,,"An evening so hot that I had to have my windows open to be comfortable. The lady upstairs started toiling away, following her usual schedule.",25,18
1pw33px,,It was just as loud as all the other days.,10,19

“QUUUIIIIIEEET!”

My yelling was followed by a large thud from upstairs.",29,23

Bump…

Bump…

Bump…

Repeating over and over again. I couldn’t place the sound.",18,34

I couldn’t take it another night; it was torture. I didn’t care what she thought of me anymore. I didn’t care about having to scold her.",29,59

1pw28yp,,"They just watched me, waiting, as though whatever was wrong with me might surface on its own if they stayed quiet long enough.",23,4
1pw28yp,,"Before a single question was asked, a voice echoed inside my head. “Hello… sir?”

The familiarity of it made my chest tighten instantly.",23,5
1pw28yp,,"I knew whose voice it was, knew it without having to think, yet my mind refused to settle on that truth.",21,6
1pw28yp,,"Other sounds followed immediately...honking, engines revving, metal screaming as it tore against metal.",13,7
1pw28yp,,"The noise piled up too fast, too dense, as if all the sound I had been denied earlier was being forced back into me at once.",26,8
1pw28yp,,"My head throbbed like it was being crushed from the inside. One of the officers leaned forward. “What do you think you’re doing here?”
I tried to answer.",28,9
1pw28yp,,"The response formed clearly in my head, but when I opened my mouth, the words came out wrong...uneven and disconnected, like they had taken a longer route than they should have.",31,10
1pw28yp,,"Meanwhile I felt another collision, sharper than the last. I screamed. The officers exchanged looks. One of them smirked. ""Huh,"" he said. ""See?",23,11
1pw28yp,,"He’s playing mad.""

Then Martin screamed, Inside me. It tore through my head, raw and desperate, repeating over and over until I couldn’t tell where it began or ended.",29,12
1pw28yp,,"I pressed my hands against my ears even though I knew it was useless. The sound wasn’t coming from anywhere my hands could reach. ""I don’t understand"", I said.",29,13

""Indeed, you aren’t"", one of them replied flatly. ""Your documents don’t belong here.",18,15

He stepped closer, close enough that I could smell the road on him. ""So you’re going to tell us who you are.",26,16

I tried to explain. The words were there, but my thoughts kept breaking apart before they could line up properly.",24,17
1pw28yp,,"Honking filled my head again, the same song and the same pattern.",12,18
1pw28yp,,"I knew with certainty that if I said any of it out loud, they wouldn’t hear what I meant. They would hear something else.",24,19
1pw28yp,,"Or worse, they would write it down. None of it could be proven, so I stayed silent. They made me sign papers I barely understood.",25,20
1pw28yp,,"My hands moved when they told them to, even though my head felt far away from my body. After that, they locked me up.",24,21
1pw28yp,,"During my time in jail, I discovered something that has never left me. I could constantly hear truck engines, sometimes one, sometimes several at once. I heard tires screeching.",29,22
1pw28yp,,"I heard devastating impacts that rattled my bones even when nothing around me moved. To this day, those collisions stay with me.",22,23
1pw28yp,,"Most nights, I wake up to them, heart racing, convinced I’ve just survived another crash. Martin’s voice stayed too.",19,24
1pw28yp,,"While he had been sitting beside me in the truck, he hadn’t just been humming. He had been saying things. I understand that now.",24,25
1pw28yp,,"The sentences were broken, tangled and unfamiliar, but beneath them I could hear him crying... for help.",17,26
1pw28yp,,"The most haunting thing he ever said to me still repeats without warning:
""Please help… I can’t move on my own.""

Eventually, I was allowed to speak with the people responsible for my release.",34,27
1pw28yp,,"I didn’t tell them the truth, I couldn’t. Instead, I told them I’d been kidnapped. That explanation was simple. Believable. The injuries on my body and face helped sell it.",30,28
1pw28yp,,"In the end, they took me back. Now this is a routine. I hear voices no matter where I am. I hear engines, collisions, my own honking repeating endlessly.",29,29
1pw28yp,,"And sometimes... ""Hello… Sir?""

Every time I hear it, I turn my head without thinking, convinced someone has called my name.",21,30
1pw28yp,,"The voice is mine, but it sounds wrong, distant, like it belongs to someone else who learned how to speak by listening to echoes. I’ve completely given up driving.",29,31

The days dragged on like years.",15,0

1pvvkbi,,"Even the memory of his voice had begun to fade, slipping away like everything else.",15,2
1pvvkbi,,"He’d begun leaving me alone more often, but never in a way that felt like relief or mercy.",18,3
1pvvkbi,,"Each day, the rusted doors next to me would screech open, revealing a dumbwaiter he’d built into the wall.",19,4
1pvvkbi,,"Every morning, it shuddered to life, its wooden frame rattling as it crept downward from whatever hellscape lay above me.",20,5
1pvvkbi,,"It always stopped short with a dull thud, shaking violently as the doors rattled.",14,6
1pvvkbi,,"Inside, there would be a single bottle of water, sometimes only half-full, along with a plate of scraps, seemingly from whatever he hadn’t finished from his dinner the night prior.",30,7
1pvvkbi,,"Once the contents were removed, the doors would close, and the wooden frame would jolt upward, swallowed by the shadows between the walls.",23,8
1pvvkbi,,The silence that followed mealtime was worse than his presence. Every slow groan of the house above me. Every uneven drip from the ceiling.,24,9
1pvvkbi,,It all felt like the breath before a scream.,9,10
1pvvkbi,,"My nerves stayed wound so tight that the only thing I could hear amongst the oppressive silence was the quick, desperate thumping of my heartbeat in my ears.",28,11
1pvvkbi,,The woman I’d met in the hallway was still there.,10,12
1pvvkbi,,"I could hear her sometimes, her soft footsteps drifting through the corridors like something half-alive, half-forgotten, performing whatever menial tasks he had bound her to.",25,13
1pvvkbi,,I often wondered why she hadn’t tried to escape. What was so special about her that he let her walk around unshackled?,22,14
1pvvkbi,,"I didn’t know it at the time, but I wouldn’t have to wait long to get answers.",17,15
1pvvkbi,,"I’d just woken up and once again settled into my little corner of hell for the day, praying that the man would forget about me, hoping he’d slip up and leave the door unlocked just once.",36,16
1pvvkbi,,"To my dismay, the chains remained, the floor beneath me feeling more like a grave than a prison with each passing day.",22,17
1pvvkbi,,"It had become much harder to remember who I was, or even who I used to be.",17,18
1pvvkbi,,"The girl who could walk down the street without looking over her shoulder, who had a good life, full of happiness and freedom, was now just a thing to him.",30,19
1pvvkbi,,A broken doll. Something he could project all of his dark fantasies onto.,13,20
1pvvkbi,,"In the middle of my loathing and self-pity, I heard a series of knocks reverberating through the room.",18,21
1pvvkbi,,"Each one was slow and deliberate, as if the person behind them wanted to make sure I heard and acknowledged them all.",22,22
1pvvkbi,,"They were followed by a silence that seemed gentler, kinder than I was used to, like the last words you hear from your mother before drifting off to sleep.",29,23
1pvvkbi,,"I had almost tricked myself into believing this would be something different, something better than what I had known it to be, but the belief quickly faded.",27,24
1pvvkbi,,"The gentle caress of that thought was replaced by the same low chuckle that I knew so well, rising from behind the door.",23,25
1pvvkbi,,My heart dropped as I began fighting the urge to tremble in fear. He need not have spoken to strike fear into me at that point.,26,26
1pvvkbi,,"I watched as his dark shadow appeared from behind the wooden door. “Time to play, Emily.” He said as he stepped inside the room with me.",26,27
1pvvkbi,,"I closed my eyes, trying to tame the silent storm raging within my head. His words stung, but there was no use in fighting. Not anymore.",26,28
1pvvkbi,,"There was no way out of this. I had barely eaten anything over the last few days, and my body was growing weaker.",23,29
1pvvkbi,,"I knew I would have to sit there and take it, or risk him hurting me even worse.",18,30
1pvvkbi,,"I could feel the edges of my sanity slipping as he inched closer. I pulled together what mental strength I had left, readying myself for whatever he had planned.",29,31
1pvvkbi,,"As he made his way toward me through the dim light, I could see that he wasn’t alone this time.",20,32
1pvvkbi,,A woman was with him… the same one I had spoken to before. Her eyes were wide and frantic.,19,33
1pvvkbi,,"She didn’t even look at me as she stepped into the room behind him, choosing instead to stare at the walls around me.",23,34
1pvvkbi,,"She was silent, not showing any outward emotion, but I could see it in her face. She was terrified.",19,35
1pvvkbi,,"The closer they both got to me, the more violently her body shook, as if I were the source of her fear.",22,36
1pvvkbi,,"“What’s happening?” I whispered, barely able to speak above the lump in my throat.",14,37
1pvvkbi,,"“What’s going on?”

He pushed the woman toward me, and she stumbled, falling to her knees before me. Tears welled up in her eyes as she looked up at me.",30,38
1pvvkbi,,"I could see that she was already covered in bruises, and her clothes were horribly torn and stained. Her face was gaunt, hollowed by exhaustion and fear.",27,39
1pvvkbi,,"She didn’t look like the same person I’d seen days before. “Emily,” she rasped, her voice cracking. “He’s... he’s changing things. Things are different now.",25,40
1pvvkbi,,"He…”

She cut herself off, her breath coming in quick, ragged gasps.",12,41
1pvvkbi,,"The tears that she had been holding back started to flow down her cheeks, as if she were finally releasing the pain she’d been carrying for so long.",28,42
1pvvkbi,,"I reached for her, desperate to know what was going on, desperate to help her, but she recoiled from my touch, fear exploding in her eyes. “No...",27,43
1pvvkbi,,"No, don’t touch me,” she whispered frantically. “Please. You don’t understand... He’s…”

Before she could finish, he took a step toward me and pressed his hand down on my shoulder.",30,44
1pvvkbi,,"I felt his cold, hard grip squeezing tighter, setting the tone before he even said a word.",17,45
1pvvkbi,,"Once he had satisfied his sick, twisted lust for control, he crouched down beside me.",15,46
1pvvkbi,,"He spoke with a soft, almost gentle tone as he leaned in, his breath hot against my ear.",18,47
1pvvkbi,,"“Well, now look what we have here,” he said, his voice smooth and mocking. “You’ve made a new friend, Emily. That’s good.",22,48
1pvvkbi,,"You’ll need all the friends you can get for your next phase.”

His smooth, icy words melted across my mind, settling into panic.",23,49
1pvvkbi,,"My heart pounded in my chest, flooding my body with adrenaline. I jerked my head away from him, desperate to put as much distance between us as possible.",28,50
1pvvkbi,,"“What are you talking about?” I asked, voice shaking. “Why are you doing this to us?",16,51
1pvvkbi,,"Please, just let us go.”

He laughed in a harsh, grating rasp, like fingernails scraping across a blackboard. “You don’t understand,” he said, his voice slipping into a near-whisper.",29,52
1pvvkbi,,“You’ll never understand. You don’t know how it feels. How good it feels to break someone down to nothing. To make them beg.,23,53
1pvvkbi,,"To make them need you.”

I flinched as his hand tightened further on my shoulder, his fingers digging deep into my skin. “Soon, you’ll get it. And when you do...",30,54
1pvvkbi,,you’ll be just like her. You’ll be begging me to help you. Begging me to make you better.,18,55
1pvvkbi,,"Oh, what a beautiful day that will be.”

He turned to the woman then, as though I were nothing more than a shadow in the room.",26,56
1pvvkbi,,"“Take her to meet Lilith,” he said coldly. “It’s time for her next lesson.”

The woman didn’t move at first.",20,57
1pvvkbi,,"She just stared at the floor, hollow-eyed and empty, as if she were already somewhere far away, lost within herself.",20,58
1pvvkbi,,"Then, slowly, she rose, unsteadily climbing to her feet, her body swaying from fatigue and stress. Her eyes remained fixed ahead, rigid and vacant, desperately avoiding my gaze.",28,59
1pvvkbi,,"In that moment, I was torn between two things that scared me senseless. The first was her.",17,60
1pvvkbi,,"She had been changed completely, which frightened me almost as much as he did. She wasn’t just broken. She had been altered. I didn’t even recognize her anymore.",28,61
1pvvkbi,,"The second thing was what hit me the hardest, sinking deep into my consciousness like a needle.",17,62
1pvvkbi,,"I could feel the unease growing as a strange, knowing certainty washed over me, telling me that whatever was coming next would not be as pleasant as the torment I’d already endured.",32,63
1pvvkbi,,This felt different. He’d had enough of trying to break me down.,12,64
1pvvkbi,,"He was preparing me for something darker, something worse that I didn’t understand yet, but could already feel reaching out for me.",22,65
1pvvkbi,,"He reached down for my right hand, yanking it toward him until the chain rattled tight.",16,66
1pvvkbi,,"He reached into his pocket, pulling out a small, silver key, and unlocked the shackle. My heart fluttered as it clattered to the floor.",24,67
1pvvkbi,,This was what I’d been waiting for. I knew this was my chance to get out of this place.,19,68
1pvvkbi,,"The instant my wrist came free, I jerked my hand back and lunged at him, frantically swinging for anything I could hit, hoping it would hurt him enough for me to escape.",32,69
1pvvkbi,,"He snapped backward and away from my fist before quickly raising his hand and bringing it crashing down across my face, snapping my head back against the wall.",28,70
1pvvkbi,,"My body fell limp, and my vision briefly faded as the world spun around me. Through the haze, I rolled my head back around, catching his gaze by mistake.",29,71
1pvvkbi,,"“See?” He said calmly through gritted teeth, “This is why you need another lesson.",14,72
1pvvkbi,,"You’re just not ready yet.”

I barely felt him release the shackle on my other wrist before a sharp, mechanical sound clicked in my ear.",25,73
1pvvkbi,,I felt a cold sting close around my wrists as he fastened handcuffs in place of the shackles.,18,74
1pvvkbi,,"Once he finished tightening the cuffs, he grabbed my chin and jerked my head upward, forcing me to look at him.",21,75
1pvvkbi,,"He stared deep into my eyes, giving me one last, chilling smile before saying:

“Enjoy your lesson, Emily.”

He stood up and walked out of the room without saying another word, the door clicking shut behind him.",37,76
1pvvkbi,,"For a few seconds, I just sat there, dizzy and disoriented, scrambling to make sense of what was going on.",20,77
1pvvkbi,,"I didn’t know what was happening, but I knew I was running out of time. I heard the woman move, slowly shuffling toward me.",24,78
1pvvkbi,,"Her hands trembled as she reached for me, but her grip was surprisingly strong. She didn’t speak or even look me in the eyes as she stood me upright.",29,79
1pvvkbi,,"My legs wobbled beneath me. I was dazed, weak, and broken, barely able to even stand on my own without her assistance.",22,80
1pvvkbi,,"She steadied me in place and, without hesitation, gently pushed me forward.",12,81
1pvvkbi,,She held one hand against the small of my back and the other one clutching the chain on my handcuffs.,20,82
1pvvkbi,,"She’d take a step and then pull me along behind her like a dog on a leash, each movement stiff and mechanical, as if she weren’t even aware of what she was doing.",33,83
1pvvkbi,,"I staggered along behind her, my body paralyzed with fear. We stepped into the hallway outside the room, and she led me toward a narrow door at the far end.",30,84
1pvvkbi,,"When she opened it, a rush of cold air spilled out, carrying the scent of sweat and long-forgotten torment.",19,85
1pvvkbi,,"Beyond the doorway lay a sub-basement that descended into what felt like some alien underworld. The stairs leading down were steep and uneven, each step groaning under our combined weight.",30,86
1pvvkbi,,"The deeper we descended, the worse everything felt. The corridor stretched into darkness, long and quiet, like a predator closing in. Finally, we reached the bottom, where another door stood.",30,87
1pvvkbi,,"Before I could even examine it, the woman reached out and turned the handle. The door to the room opened with a loud groan, twisting my stomach into knots.",29,88
1pvvkbi,,"As I was guided across the threshold, I scanned the space thoroughly, the truth hitting me almost immediately. This wasn’t a room at all. It was a cage.",28,89
1pvvkbi,,"The floor was made of slick, uneven concrete stained with remnants of something I couldn’t identify. Chains and hooks jutted from the walls at odd angles, shadows pooling beneath them.",30,90
1pvvkbi,,"A single dim light flickered overhead, casting the room in a sickening orange glow that barely reached the walls.",19,91
1pvvkbi,,"Cold, blackened metal bars stretched from floor to ceiling, enclosing a space barely large enough for a single person.",19,92
1pvvkbi,,"Inside the bars lay another woman, bloodied, bruised, naked, and curled up in a ball.",15,93
1pvvkbi,,"She didn’t move when we entered, but her eyes were wide open, staring into the blackness. They were empty, as if she had been stripped of her own soul.",29,94
1pvvkbi,,"I could feel her despair radiating from her. “Go ahead,” the woman said to me, her voice distant. “He says you have to meet her...",25,95
1pvvkbi,,"and then, you’ll be ready.”

“Meet her?” I whispered, hoping the woman behind the bars couldn’t hear me.",18,96
1pvvkbi,,"I took a step back, but the woman behind me grabbed the chain on the cuffs and forced me forward. “He says you have to know...",26,97
1pvvkbi,,You have to know what happens when you don’t learn quickly enough. He just wants you to obey.” The woman’s voice trembled.,22,98
1pvvkbi,,"I could feel her hands shaking through the metal of the handcuffs. “Please... don’t make the same mistake I did.”

The cage creaked as the woman inside it shifted.",29,99
1pvvkbi,,"She looked up at me with blank eyes, her expression unreadable, like a shell of a person who’d once been. “Please,” I whispered, choking on the words.",27,100
1pvvkbi,,"“Please don’t put me in there.”

She didn’t answer. She just kept pulling me toward the cage, following her orders. That’s when it all hit me.",26,101
1pvvkbi,,I finally accepted the truth that I had tried so hard to deny. She was never going to help me. She was just another victim.,25,102
1pvvkbi,,Another piece of his twisted puzzle. And I was just one more name on the list of broken people who would learn the hard way.,25,103

1pvonld,,"Burton is a small city sitting just by Highway 54 – A small highway system that nobody uses unless you're actually going south, and know where you're exactly going.",29,8
1pvonld,,"It's pretty much the only city that is actually not a small town around the south west Kansas area, so it's a guarantee that people who wanted to go south would drive there to reach New Mexico.",37,9
1pvonld,,"When I got there however in my couple of runs over there during my delivery, it was the strangest town I have ever drove.",24,10
1pvonld,,"I can't exactly explain why I said it. So, I'm going to explain why, it sounds like I'm rambling, but trust me, I'm not lying this time.",27,11
1pvonld,,"That was my first time as the driver within the western Kansas, as my colleague who was supposed to do the runs there got really sick and decided to take a week off.",33,12
1pvonld,,My boss asked me if I could cover some of his routes.,12,13
1pvonld,,"At first, I wanted to not take any of the routes he took, as it was far away, and half the time, driving that long in Kansas is just plain borinf.",31,14
1pvonld,,That however was changed as he offered me a $2 hourly premium on top of what I was already being paid for. I accepted the offer.,26,15
1pvonld,,"I know it's dumb to accept an offer that low, but still, I can't let myself pass that up.",19,16
1pvonld,,I then started my shift and began my 2 hour drive to some of the small towns in South Western Kansas.,21,17
1pvonld,,It was a pretty boring drive; kinda why I said I won't take this route at first as the highways I have to take to get there were just so boring.,31,18
1pvonld,,"As I drove, I turned on the radio. At the time, that was the only thing inside.",17,19
1pvonld,,"There was nothing inside the truck that entertained me while I did this long drive; no Bluetooth that I could connect my phone to, no aux cable for me to just plug it in, only the radio.",37,20
1pvonld,,I turned it on and tuned to anything that is worth listening to.,13,21
1pvonld,,"I came across the radio station for Burton, the small city that was only 24 miles ahead of me.",19,22
1pvonld,,I tuned in to the radio station and listened; it was something to finally break the monotony of this drive.,20,23
1pvonld,,"""98.9 Cruise FM, where your life in the highway means life in cruising""

The radio station began to play Owner Of A Lonely Heart.",24,24
1pvonld,,"This was the moment I just began to jam on the radio, singing that song as loud as I could, hoping I sound like the singer in that song.",29,25
1pvonld,,"I just hoped the bosses didn't just hear the crappiest rendition of the song I was listening to, I know.",20,26
1pvonld,,"My jam eventually became more subdued as I saw a sign. It was a road sign, pointing directly to the direction I was heading.",24,27
1pvonld,,I have just arrived at the city of Burton.,9,28
1pvonld,,"I was greeted by the swaths of roadside establishments, such as grocery stores, hotels, restaurants, and even a casino by the side.",22,29
1pvonld,,"Before entering the city, there's an exit that leads back to the highway, which means when you go straight, it leads you to the downtown of the city.",28,30
1pvonld,,"I pressed on and was greeted with a strip mall placed as the nexus point of this highway side commerce, and this mall seems to be filled with activity, from cars to people walking by.",35,31
1pvonld,,"I've never been to Burton before, but it seems it won't be a boring place to be after all, it has everything I need to actually stop by and buy something on a roadtrip.",34,32
1pvonld,,"I continued driving on one of Burton's main roads, Avelia Ave. I was greeted by the suburbs of Burton itself.",20,33
1pvonld,,"The place seems to be pretty neat; rows of houses, small businesses, and paralleling this road is a rail track.",20,34
1pvonld,,Going straight to this main road finally led me to Downtown Burton.,12,35
1pvonld,,"It was an incredibly beautiful place to be; places such as cafes, restaurants, a tattoo shop, and even a store to buy movies and video games, not bad.",28,36
1pvonld,,The one thing I liked about this city is just how clean it is.,14,37
1pvonld,,"There's literally no trash on the pavement, no crackheads, and not even a person who is just hanging around, it's just people walking by and going about their day.",29,38
1pvonld,,This isn't like Topeka where I swear every single spot in that city has some crackhead lingering on the streets and making people uncomfortable.,24,39
1pvonld,,"I arrived on my first stop of my run, a small cafe in Downtown Burton.",15,40
1pvonld,,I turned the truck's engine off and I began walking at the back of the truck from the inside.,19,41
1pvonld,,I grabbed the package; It was a medium sized box that I grabbed and eventually opened the door of the van for the first time.,25,42
1pvonld,,The smell of Burton became more apparent as I stepped on the concrete sidewalk of the city.,17,43
1pvonld,,"It was the faint smell of roses, the smell that no matter where I walked in this place, the faint sensation seeped into my nostrils.",25,44
1pvonld,,"The wind was calm and the noise I heard was minimal, almost as if people were all inside the buildings, and the people who are walking right now are the people heading to their destination.",35,45
1pvonld,,"The sound of passing cars were all the noise I heard, and some occasional conversations between people.",17,46
1pvonld,,"It was arguably one of the quietest places I have ever stepped foot on within this city, it's crazy to think a city can be this quiet, but hey, I won't complain.",32,47
1pvonld,,I walked into the cafe. It was a small place; 5 tables and a counter across the building from the entrance.,21,48
1pvonld,,"Behind the counter led to the kitchen, with an opening to where food is going to be placed.",18,49
1pvonld,,"As I walked towards the counter, an employee of the cafe, named Emma judging by the badge on her chest, greeted me with a heartwarming smile.",26,50
1pvonld,,"""Hello and welcome to Downtown Café, what can I get you for?"" She asked me with this affectionate and chippy tone that actually caught me off guard a bit.",29,51
1pvonld,,"""Uhh yeah, here's your delivery"" I said as I reached for my PDA on my vest.",16,52
1pvonld,,"""Sign here please""

Emma looked at me for a brief moment, and she then signed on the PDA.",18,53
1pvonld,,"She then grabbed the box and passed it to her coworker, a man around the same age as Emma and brought it inside the kitchen, out of my view.",29,54
1pvonld,,"""So, can I give you a coffee to get your day up?"" Emma asked. ""I suppose you can give me a roasted coffee if you don't mind,"" I said.",29,55
1pvonld,,"""Wonderful, I'll give you a cup in no time"" she spoke with a chipper voice

She turned away from me as I watched her make my coffee.",27,56
1pvonld,,"Her hips swayed gently, as she began to sing in a slightly quiet volume. She mixed the cream and the sugar with seamless flow, and finally stirred the hot coffee.",30,57
1pvonld,,"Eventually, she turned around with the cup of hot coffee she just made and placed it on the counter 

""Here you are sir, enjoy your darkest coffee of your life"" Emma quipped as she smiled at me with the clear hint of satisfaction.",43,58
1pvonld,,I grabbed the cup and began to take a sip.,10,59
1pvonld,,"The taste is just perfect; the perfect balance of bitter, and sweet, almost as if the coffee was created for someone like me who travels a lot, and hates McDonald's coffee.",31,60
1pvonld,,Emma saw my expression as I glanced back at her. I have never seen someone this pleased over a simple cup of coffee she served.,25,61
1pvonld,,I actually almost feel bad for not paying her.,9,62
1pvonld,,"""Do you like it?"" Emma asked

""This is good actually, I like it"" I respond, as I nodded

""I'm glad to hear it mister"" she said 

As I sipped my coffee, I heard the door open.",36,63
1pvonld,,"I glanced at the front door and it was a police officer entering the cafe. Emma seemed to be in high spirits seeing this man enter. ""Oh hi Mr.",29,64
1pvonld,,"Smith, you are early today"" Emma said in the same chopper voice that she had

""Well, it's the job young lass, there is always something outside that needs handling"" The officer replied, as he pushed the tip of his cap off, showing his face clearly.",45,65
1pvonld,,"""Same order Mr. Smith?"" Emma asked

I watched the two talk for a moment. As Emma poured the officer's coffee, I took a good look at the man.",28,66
1pvonld,,"He looks around in his late 40s, greying hair, and has an imposing stature.",14,67
1pvonld,,"He also has this faint scar that runs at the right side of his neck, which is more noticeable when he tilts his head to his left.",27,68
1pvonld,,The man probably has seen a lot of crazy stuff in his entire career; he's probably not even surprised at everything he sees at this point after years of being a cop.,32,69
1pvonld,,"""Here you go sir"" Emma said. She slides the coffee cup on the counter. The officer grabbed it and took a quick sip of the hot coffee.",27,70
1pvonld,,He looked pleased at what Emma made for him that he nodded in approval.,14,71
1pvonld,,"“It taste good Emma” Cop complimented

“Thanks sir, my mother said I was a good barista”

Eventually, after all of that talking between one another, The officer finally turned towards me.",31,72
1pvonld,,"He looked at me with a curious look, before sipping his coffee before he spoke 

""Delivery?"" The officer asked

""Yeah, lots of deliveries down here"" I replied, nodding.",28,73
1pvonld,,I looked at his uniform. His name is actually Bradley written on his badge. He nodded and then stood straight back up after leaning.,24,74
1pvonld,,"""Son, it will be a busy day for you here. Where are you from?"" Bradley inquired. ""Well, I'm from Wichita.",20,75
1pvonld,,"It's like a 2 hour drive from here"" I respond 

""You're far away from home it seems. I respect your effort at driving for 2 hours.",26,76
1pvonld,,"The other guy who used to drive here before seemed to look like he had enough all the time"" Bradley quipped.",21,77
1pvonld,,"""What do you mean?"" I asked

""Well, the last time he was here.",13,78
1pvonld,,I saw him pale as a ghost when he stopped on one of the houses in the Southside of town. I thought he was just experiencing shock.,27,79
1pvonld,,"The reality was, he saw Josey, and he thought she was going to do something crazy. Poor thing she is"".",20,80
1pvonld,,"Eventually, the officer decided to slowly head towards the front door. He nodded to Emma, to which she smiled.",19,81
1pvonld,,"She glanced at me for a split second before looking back at the front door. For one last time, Bradley looked at me again as he walked.",27,82
1pvonld,,"""You take care of yourself, and have a safe drive"". Bradley said as he left the cafe.",17,83
1pvonld,,"After a couple of minutes of conversation, I eventually left the cafe – Not before Emma in her chipper on the corner of my ear, ""I hope to see you soon Markus"".",32,84
1pvonld,,"As I closed the front door, meeting me once again was the scent of roses, my god I can smell it. I began to walk back to my truck.",29,85
1pvonld,,"I watched as Bradley just drove off in his police car. Wait a minute, I just remembered something. Did she just call me by my name?",26,86
1pvonld,,"Or am I hearing things? I brushed that one off, probably my ears heard something elseI hopped back in my truck and now continue with my run.",27,87
1pvonld,,I placed my still warm coffee on the cupholder and headed back to the road once more.,17,88
1pvonld,,"As I drove within the city once more, I eventually found myself in a more affluent area of the city.",20,89
1pvonld,,"I noticed that every single lawn within this area has campaign materials on their lawns – mostly shows the candidate, Carmen Berkshire.",22,90
1pvonld,,"Now, during my time here in Kansas, there was a state election that will begin in the next 2 months.",20,91
1pvonld,,"Mostly a state election, the midterms are about to happen anyway.",11,92
1pvonld,,"They seemed pretty eager to vote for this woman as their representative, definitely not the first and not the last time this city will vote for her.",27,93
1pvonld,,Perhaps she's very popular in this city? Maybe she was a really good donor down here? Or perhaps this is just exclusive to this neighborhood?,25,94
1pvonld,,"Who knows, I'm not a politician. Speaking of this city, I just arrived at my second destination. It's a typical cookie cutter house within this affluent suburb within the city.",30,95
1pvonld,,"I parked the truck in front of their driveway and grabbed the package. This one is big, and heavy, almost as if they're shipping some serious hardware with this thing.",30,96
1pvonld,,"Jumping out of my truck, I carried this box onto my shoulders and began to march towards the front door.",20,97
1pvonld,,I took my first step onto the porch stairs as I looked at the front door of the house.,19,98
1pvonld,,The air around this place smelled even more pleasant than the downtown area.,13,99
1pvonld,,"The lingering scent of lavender permeates all across the front door; I don't even know where it came from, but unlike the downtown area however, the scent is much more prominent here than back where I came – like the smell of a typical city is replaced by this incredibly powerful air freshener that just goes around.",57,100
1pvonld,,"The sound of the city is even more muffled; like the sound of cars just dampened out based on just how quiet it is, like your ears will ring if you try to listen to the serene atmosphere around me.",40,101
1pvonld,,"Eventually, I rang the doorbell. The door opened and I was greeted by the sight of an old woman inside.",20,102
1pvonld,,"She looked like she just finished doing something and I decided to just knock. ""Hey ma'am. Here's your delivery"" I said, laying the heavy box down on her porch.",29,103
1pvonld,,"""Sure thing mister, I'll take care of my package"" She replied, peering on the corner to see if the box is there 

I pulled out my PDA and pass her the small stylus that I use to sign signatures with

""How is your day my dear?"" The old woman inquired, with a gaze as if she was expecting an answer

""It's pretty alright.",63,104
1pvonld,,"Busy day for me"" I answered unconsciously 

""I understand the feeling. My husband is a busy man as well. He works at construction as a Foreman down by the Southside.",30,105
1pvonld,,He told me many times that he should be spending more time with me.,14,106
1pvonld,,"Then again, the Mayor do ask a lot of things after all""

In that entire spiel, I just nodded along.",20,107
1pvonld,,I eventually retrieved my PDA back and placed it in my pockets.,12,108
1pvonld,,"I said my thanks in a brief conversation, but she then asked something to me that made my head turn back at her.",23,109
1pvonld,,"""Are you new in this town?"" She asked

""Well, yeah. I'm not from around here as you can tell"" I replied

""Oh I see.",24,110
1pvonld,,"Sorry if I bother you with that conversation, many of us here just wanted to know if you are okay"" she asserted, as she gave me a smile.",28,111
1pvonld,,I finally left this old woman's porch.,7,112
1pvonld,,"A quick glance side to side and I noticed that it is still quiet outside, maybe this is the most peaceful neighborhood I have ever stepped foot on.",28,113
1pvonld,,It's impressive just how quiet it is here. I hopped back in my truck. I looked at my phone and it looked like it was close to my lunchtime.,29,114
1pvonld,,Still got one more package that I have to deliver before I go for my lunch and drive back onto the highway.,22,115
1pvonld,,"I drove to the 3rd destination of my delivery. This neighborhood led me to a much more working class neighborhood, people often called “Southside”.",24,116
1pvonld,,"Basic sized houses like your typical bungalow or occasional old school houses that have 2 separate floors for each tenant, modest backyards, and these trees on the side.",28,117
1pvonld,,Then we have dirt alleyways with surprisingly not a single trace of garbage.,13,118
1pvonld,,"Occasionally, I spot a house that looks like a typical landfill, with a random hoard of items on their lawns, but beyond the porches of these houses, it's pretty much clean from where I drove to the sidewalk.",38,119
1pvonld,,This has to be one of the most impressive cleaning I have ever seen a town to think even their poorer neighborhood looks like someone sweeps the roads every single day.,31,120
1pvonld,,"Now that I have thought about it, I have never once seen a single person who looks like your typical gangbanger or your local methhead who has a crack house to take their stuff in this entire neighborhood.",38,121
1pvonld,,"This place is just clean, empty, and frankly, the quietest place I have ever stepped foot on.",17,122
1pvonld,,"Sure there are parked cars on each side, telling me people do live in these houses, but this Southside the cop once mentioned is pretty neat, like any reasonable family could live in this place if they want.",38,123
1pvonld,,"I continued my cruise down Southside. The area has a church being constructed, but then also 4 cop cars around the place. ""Interesting"" I thought.",25,124
1pvonld,,Maybe the warning about Bradley earlier is starting to become more and more true.,14,125
1pvonld,,"I mean, that's a lot of cop cars for a construction site, why would there be cops on a construction site of all places. My drive continued.",27,126
1pvonld,,"More and more, Southside looked less like a naturally pleasant neighborhood and more like every crackhead, every drunk, every vagrant just… left – like they're not here at all but the area looks like it could be a horrible place to live in.",43,127
1pvonld,,"After minutes of driving, I come face to face with my final destination in my delivery.",16,128
1pvonld,,"It's a small house – the house has a brown color, almost looks like the house is made entirely of wood.",21,129
1pvonld,,I parked the truck and finally grabbed the package for this destination.,12,130
1pvonld,,"It has a strange shape for a box; it is long but a narrow box, almost as if I'm carrying something long like a guitar or something.",27,131
1pvonld,,"I carried the box towards the porch, as I stepped on the rickety steps of this house's front facade.",19,132
1pvonld,,"I dropped the box on the floor and began knocking at the door. Unlike the last house which was immediate, this one took a while before the door answered.",29,133
1pvonld,,"I stood by the porch for what seemed to be a couple of minutes until I heard someone rummaging inside, audible behind the wooden door. The door finally opened.",29,134
1pvonld,,I was greeted by a disheveled man; his thick beard is the thing I immediately noticed the moment we both lay eyes on each other.,25,135
1pvonld,,"""What is it?"" The man asked

""Here's your delivery sir"" I replied, showing him the package 

""Oh yeah, that's right, my bad"" he muttered

He stepped outside and looked at the package.",32,136
1pvonld,,"His glance went from the box, then towards me as he stared at me

""Did you open the box?"" He asked, his voice have an accusatory tone in it

""No, I don't open anyone's package when I bring them here"" I corrected 

""Good.",43,137
1pvonld,,"That's all I'm asking. These days, people here need to mind their own business.",14,138
1pvonld,,"I swear, people just grab my stuff and leave me to dry"" He remarked, glancing around me

Eventually, he grabbed the box and immediately placed it inside of his house.",30,139
1pvonld,,"The man stepped back outside and stood by the door, his hand on his hip as he began to talk once more

""So, what's your deal in this town exactly?"" He asked me

""I'm just the delivery driver, I'm not from here really"" I replied

""Uh huh, oh, in any case, here's my word of advice for you if you ever step foot in this city again.",67,140
1pvonld,,"Watch out for Josey next door. She's been going crazy for the past couple of days. I'd say she's going to hurt someone"" warned by the man.",27,141
1pvonld,,"""I'll keep that in mind"" I responded 

Eventually, I decided to wave goodbye as I stepped down the stairs. Why is he telling me that?",25,142
1pvonld,,It's not like I'm going to return here and converse with whoever this Josey is. I immediately hopped back inside my truck and started the engine.,26,143
1pvonld,,"I took a deep breath, thinking whether I should eat something first or I should leave this city for today.",20,144
1pvonld,,My body decided food is top priority at the moment; not even the coffee can handle my hunger.,18,145
1pvonld,,"After my run, I drove to a nearby diner and stopped there for the day to eat.",17,146
1pvonld,,I parked my truck just by the side of the main road and I exited my truck.,17,147
1pvonld,,"Once more, the downtown has this rich smell of roses that I could not explain.",15,148
1pvonld,,"The more I stood, the more I'm confused as to how these people managed to make this city smell something this rich of flavor.",24,149
1pvonld,,Even the smoke of my own truck's fumes couldn't even register on my own nostrils.,15,150
1pvonld,,"I decided to enter the diner

Inside the Diner, as I sat on one of the tables, I was greeted by a waiter named Jonas.",25,151
1pvonld,,"Just like Emma from the cafe earlier, Jonas here is just as chipper as she is.",16,152
1pvonld,,"If anything, I've never felt more intrigued by someone this jovial on a menial task as this. ""Hello sir and welcome to Downtown Diner.",24,153
1pvonld,,"What is the order today sir?"" Jonas asked

""Just give me Bacon and Eggs and a glass of water""

""Of course, I'll return with your meal in 5 minutes” 

Jonas walked off.",32,154
1pvonld,,I glance and take in the scenery of this diner.,10,155
1pvonld,,"The place looked like your 1950s or 60s style diner with checkered floors, seating next to walls, and the counter with drinks behind them.",24,156
1pvonld,,Among those is a huge bulletin board placed on the corner of the wall.,14,157
1pvonld,,"There's a lot of them tacked onto the board itself, most of them are just the usual garage sales, hirings, or programs, nothing special really.",25,158
1pvonld,,"Jonas arrived with my meal and laid down the plate. It was my egg and bacon that I ordered; it smells pretty good too, almost irresistible.",26,159
1pvonld,,I handled my fork and knife as I began to slice my first bite. It was calming to just eat here and not think about what happened earlier.,28,160
1pvonld,,"Although, it still bothers me that this town, for a place so clean, so organized, there is something that isn't quite right.",22,161
1pvonld,,"Emma, that girl in the coffee shop, how did she know my name? I've never even met her my entire life, so how could she know something like that?",29,162
1pvonld,,Who is this Josey they keep telling me?,8,163
1pvonld,,They talk to her like she's some sort of rabid animal that got out of the clinic or zoo to create some chaos out here.,25,164
1pvonld,,This has got to be the first time in years I question if this town has something I don't know about.,21,165
1pvonld,,"Then again, I don't like driving out here for 2 hours just to deliver something, but hey, what do I know.",21,166
1pvonld,,I finished my meal and glanced at the open window. The scene of a clean city never disappears from my mind.,21,167
1pvonld,,"Thinking about it, I've never once felt at peace or even felt like I was safe.",16,168
1pvonld,,"I never once felt that the city felt like it's going to rob me or kill me, I felt more like I was part of the town even.",28,169
1pvonld,,"Do you know the feeling where even if you are a stranger on a small movement or even a larger movement, you know there's a lot of people walking with you, sharing the same goal?",35,170
1pvonld,,"The idea that even if you're all by yourself, you'll never feel intimidated, never felt like you're going to lose yourself from the crowd.",24,171
1pvonld,,"This is what I felt walking around this place. Everyone knows you are welcomed, everyone knows you're alright. I stopped thinking about what happened earlier and paid my bill.",29,172
1pvonld,,"I left the restaurant and finally jumped back inside my truck. Before I even turned the ignition, onto the driver side window, a little girl walked by the truck.",29,173
1pvonld,,I looked out my window and I saw the girl.,10,174
1pvonld,,She looks like she is around 10 years of age wearing what seems to be a shirt showing a local charity group.,22,175
1pvonld,,"In her hand, she is holding what seems to be a pamphlet. “Here you go sir” She said in a chipper voice

I grabbed the pamphlet and she walked off.",30,176
1pvonld,,"I watched her pass more pamphlets to other people in front of her, from people walking by to people inside their cars, all of them greeted her.",27,177
1pvonld,,"I turned the ignition of the truck and finally, the vehicle came to life once again. I looked at the pamphlet she gave me.",24,178
1pvonld,,"There, I saw that this is about a charity organization within the city of Burton.",15,179
1pvonld,,"Here's what it says:

“With the annual celebration of our mistress' blessings getting closer, it is a reminder as her children, you can show your blessings to our fellow citizens by donating.",32,180
1pvonld,,"Here's all what you can donate to the organization:

Clothes
Toys
Food

Or, if you do not have anything to spare, you can also donate $5 to our organization.",29,181
1pvonld,,"We would accept any kind of donations. Thank you for your consideration”

I wonder what kind of charity this would be.",21,182
1pvonld,,Who is this mistress this pamphlet is telling me I wonder? Maybe that's how they call their leader? Maybe that's their weird church in this place?,26,183
1pvonld,,"I just brushed it off and began driving out of the city. Before I turned the wheel of the truck, the truck door opened suddenly.",25,184
1pvonld,,The door swung violently to the side and what emerged was a man who was frantically trying to tell me to drive out of here. “Get us out of here!,30,185
1pvonld,,"Please!” He shouted

My body froze in place. I don't know if I should drive as he said or just stay in place.",23,186
1pvonld,,"I watched him peer through outside the truck, looking at something from the distance.",14,187
1pvonld,,"His face contorted into a face of desperation, panic set inside of him as he pleaded for me to drive out of here.",23,188
1pvonld,,"He shook me as he screamed at me

“Please! Get me out of here! I'm begging you! Before I managed to drive off, 4 cops caught up to the man.",30,189
1pvonld,,I watched as the 4 cops dragged him out of the truck and eventually pinned him down the ground.,19,190
1pvonld,,The cops shouted commands on him as he was being cuffed by one of the officers.,16,191
1pvonld,,One of those was Officer Bradley; his unmistakable greying hair stuck out alongside his younger colleagues.,16,192
1pvonld,,"“This is 1A2, we have the suspect in custody” Officer Bradley asserted through his radio. He then looked at me and immediately recognized me

“Son? It's you.",27,193
1pvonld,,"Are you ok?” Officer Bradley asked

“I'm fine,” I muttered. “I'm sorry if this man shocked you earlier.",18,194
1pvonld,,"We were looking for him for the past couple of days and, by the looks of it, he finally stepped out.” 

He takes quick glances at me and his colleagues, checking if his men managed to completely restrained him.",39,195
1pvonld,,"“So, with that out of the way, do you want to make a statement? Is it ok for you to step out for a second?",25,196
1pvonld,,I'll just ask you a couple of questions for a moment.,11,197
1pvonld,,"I promise, you'll be on your way again once everything is settled”

I told everything that happened before and during when the man entered my truck.",26,198
1pvonld,,"The entire time, Officer Bradley listened to what I had to say, as he wrote everything I told him.",19,199
1pvonld,,"Eventually, he hid his notepad and his gaze softened for a moment.",12,200
1pvonld,,"“Thank you, I know it's a lot to take in after what just happened, but I assured you, you are safe with us.",23,201
1pvonld,,"Now, do you wish to write a victim impact statement as well?” Officer Bradley asked

“No thanks, I think I'm good” I said

Officer Bradley nodded as he fixed his hat.",31,202
1pvonld,,He said his goodbyes as he and the other officers began to jump inside their cruisers and drove off. Man this is the most interesting day of my life.,29,203
1pvonld,,I thought I was going to have something crazy happen in this town. It is strange. The man that jumped in my truck wanted to leave this place.,28,204
1pvonld,,What's so scary about this place?,6,205
1pvonld,,"I know the town can be weird, or can be really off putting, but this place is something anyone can live in, a place where a family can raise their kids without worrying about people jumping on you.",38,206
1pvonld,,"Maybe there's something I just don't understand that I have to find out. I finally left the city, now heading back to Wichita.",23,207
1pvonld,,"I admit, this has to be the most interesting delivery run I did so far. Before I arrived back home however, I decided to fill up the truck with gas.",30,208
1pvonld,,"Cruising by the highway, I saw a decently sized gas station directly in front of me. I decided that I'm going to take a quick stop for a moment.",29,209
1pvonld,,"I parked the truck next to the pumps and I began to fill it up with whatever the company gave me for gas money, sweet.",25,210
1pvonld,,"As my truck filled up, I entered the store and began to peruse the store for something to eat on my way back.",23,211
1pvonld,,"I eventually come across on the far corner of the store, an advertisement board, you know, the kind where every company and organization places their flyers for people to see.",30,212
1pvonld,,"This one however, is different. Dotted from top to bottom of the brown board, more than a dozen missing persons posters.",21,213
1pvonld,,"From the top is an old woman who went missing near Montezuma, a 30 minute drive from Burton.",18,214
1pvonld,,"The next is a young woman who went missing in Dodge City, a quarter half minute drive from Burton. Another is a missing poster of a young girl.",28,215
1pvonld,,"This time, she went missing just a week ago in Burton. This goes on and on until the bottom.",19,216
1pvonld,,"I looked at each one, all of them, every single one of these posters. I looked at them all, everyone that went missing.",23,217
1pvonld,,"Around Burton, there's just so many people who went missing in the area. Wow, there's so many.",17,218
1pvitpu,Coal's Too Kind a Gift for Some,"Where do I even begin? Being a college student, I’m not doing the best financially. So, considering it’s the jolly season, I got a job as a mall Santa.",29,0
1pvitpu,,"I’ve done this for a couple of years, and honestly, I love it even though it barely pays enough to buy beer.",22,1
1pvitpu,,"But the acting and the voice imitation make me feel like a kid again. God, do I miss when my parents used to take me Christmas shopping.",27,2
1pvitpu,,"We’d rent a few movies, buy new toys, grab some food, and come home to play with my cousins. But anyway, I’m getting ahead of myself.",26,3
1pvitpu,,"This happened on Friday night. The mall I worked at was crowded, mostly with parents and little kids lining up to tell Santa their wishes.",25,4
1pvitpu,,"I spoke to one kid after another. Some had demanding requests like gaming consoles or expensive clothing. Others had simpler, cuter wishes like a dog or a cat.",28,5
1pvitpu,,"And some… well, some had wishes that almost made me cry.",11,6
1pvitpu,,"One kid asked me to make his mom love him again, another asked me to wake his dad up from a coma. Those always stick with me.",27,7
1pvitpu,,"Now, I was almost about to close up when a couple approached and asked if I could spare a few more minutes for their son.",25,8
1pvitpu,,"Being the kind-hearted person I am, I said, “Sure,” and pulled the red rope near the chair to signal that I was still open.",24,9
1pvitpu,,"The boy looked… troubled, to say the least. It was one of those moments when you just know something isn’t right with a kid.",24,10
1pvitpu,,"He was well-dressed, well-mannered, and looked to be about nine years old. His parents, on the other hand, seemed warm and welcoming.",22,11
1pvitpu,,"The dad looked like he worked in construction, judging by the bruises and calluses on his hands. The mom mentioned she was an elementary school teacher.",26,12
1pvitpu,,"I picked the boy up and placed him on my lap. I went into the usual routine, saying “Ho Ho Ho!",21,13
1pvitpu,,"What’s your name, little man?”

 

He just stared at me with… malice in his eyes, then grinned through his teeth.",20,14
1pvitpu,,I waited for a moment before deciding to wrap it up as quickly as possible as the kid was giving me the creeps. “A quiet kid!,26,15
1pvitpu,,"Have you been a good boy this year?”

 

He leaned in close to my ear, making sure to purposely bump me with his leg. “No, I wasn’t.”

 

“Really?",28,16
1pvitpu,,"What did you do?” I asked in my best Santa voice, unaware of how disturbing the answer would be. “Mom won’t see her cat anymore,” he giggled into my ear.",30,17
1pvitpu,,“What?” I was dumbfounded and accidentally broke character. “Let’s just say… Mr. Twinkles is missing his winter jacket.” He started tugging on my real beard.,25,18
1pvitpu,,"Angry and fuming, I whispered back, “Okay, kid, what do you want so I can get out of here?!”

 

He pressed his mouth to my ear, “I want freedom.",29,19
1pvitpu,,"I want my boring parents dead. Can you kill them for me?”

 

“Okay, no!” I tried to shove him off my lap.",22,20
1pvitpu,,"As I did, I felt a sharp pain in my thigh before he darted off toward his parents.",18,21
1pvitpu,,"When I placed my hand there, I noticed a few drops of blood. “He stabbed me with something!” I yelled at the parents.",23,22
1pvitpu,,"His dad went furious and pulled him hard on the arm, while his mother pleaded for him to go easy on the kid.",23,23
1pvitpu,,"Thankfully, the police arrived within a couple of minutes, since they were already stationed in the mall due to the holidays.",21,24
1pvitpu,,What scared me almost as much as the dirty needle was what they found afterward. I didn’t even know they searched children.,22,25
1pvitpu,,"Inside a small, makeshift pouch sewn into his jacket was a greenish cat collar.",14,26
1pvitpu,,"It was stiff, brittle… and darkened in places, like it had been soaked in something a long time ago. The parents looked just as shocked as I felt.",28,27
1pvitpu,,"They swore they had no idea where it came from. The kid only smiled when the officers held it up, rocking back and forth like he was proud of himself.",30,28
1pvitpu,,The police rolled the cameras and saw him wondering off from his parents and taking too much of an interest in the rat poison on one of the shelves.,29,29
1pvitpu,,I decided not to press charges. The parents were normal people and they kept apologizing until their voices cracked. Later that night I checked the wound again.,27,30
1pvitpu,,"It stings and it’s getting warm to the touch. Still, I couldn’t stop thinking about what he said. About “*freedom”* and his parents.",23,31
1pvitpu,,I’m waiting on my lab results; I hope I’m clean but…I have my doubts.,14,32
1pvidyj,In the Dark of Night,I was a quiet child. Not shy. Not anxious. Just observant in the way adults mistake for good behavior. I noticed patterns. I learned routines quickly.,26,0
1pvidyj,,"I understood when it was better to stay silent. That is why no one believed me later, when I finally tried to explain.",23,1
1pvidyj,,"The house we lived in was old, even by local standards. It had been built before zoning laws, before inspectors, before anyone cared what rested beneath a foundation.",28,2
1pvidyj,,"It sat slightly lower than the road, as if it had settled into the earth rather than been placed on it.",21,3
1pvidyj,,"My bedroom was on the second floor, directly above the living room. I did not choose that room.",18,4
1pvidyj,,"It was simply where the previous owners had put a bed, and my parents did not question it. From the first week, I had trouble sleeping.",26,5
1pvidyj,,It was not fear at first. It was awareness. The sense that something in the room adjusted itself when I closed my eyes. The air felt thicker at night.,29,6
1pvidyj,,"Sound behaved strangely. Footsteps downstairs carried upward, but my own breathing seemed swallowed before it reached my ears.",18,7
1pvidyj,,"The first time I saw it, I was lying awake, staring at the door. There was a shape standing at the foot of my bed.",25,8
1pvidyj,,"It was not human, but it wore a human outline well enough that my mind tried to supply details. Height. Shoulders. A head where a head should be.",28,9
1pvidyj,,"It was darker than the surrounding darkness, like a void punched through the room. It did not move.",18,10
1pvidyj,,"I remember thinking that if I could just stay still, it might decide I was not worth the effort. It stood there until morning. The next night, it came back.",30,11
1pvidyj,,"And the next. It never approached. Never reached for me. It remained at the foot of the bed, perfectly positioned to observe.",22,12
1pvidyj,,I began to understand that it was not there to frighten me. It was there to confirm something. Weeks passed. I grew used to sleeping under observation.,27,13
1pvidyj,,That is the part that still makes me uncomfortable to admit. Fear dulls when it has no outlet. You stop reacting. You start accommodating.,24,14
1pvidyj,,"I learned to keep my eyes half-lidded. I learned how to breathe quietly. I learned that crying only made the room feel tighter. Then, one night, the room changed.",29,15
1pvidyj,,"Another shape appeared, emerging from the corner near my dresser. Shorter. Broader. Less precise. It positioned itself beside the first. They turned slightly toward one another.",26,16
1pvidyj,,"The sound they made was not loud, but it was invasive. Sharp clicks. Rhythmic. Structured. The kind of sound that carries meaning even when you do not understand it.",29,17
1pvidyj,,They were not whispering. They were evaluating. Their attention shifted between me and the space around the bed. The clicking sped up when they looked at the floor.,28,18
1pvidyj,,"Slowed when they looked at my face. Something in me recognized the tone. This was not curiosity. This was verification. After that, the second figure returned regularly. Sometimes they spoke.",30,19
1pvidyj,,"Sometimes they stood in silence, as if waiting for a condition to be met. The third arrived during a winter storm.",21,20
1pvidyj,,"I remember because the power went out, and the house became completely dark. This one was taller than the doorframe allowed.",21,21
1pvidyj,,"Its head bent at an angle that suggested it had grown without regard for architecture. When it entered, the other two went still. It clicked once.",26,22
1pvidyj,,The sound was deeper than the others. Weighted. Final. That was the moment I understood that they were not visiting. They were overseeing. The nights grew longer.,27,23
1pvidyj,,"The room felt compressed, as if the house itself were leaning inward.",12,24
1pvidyj,,"I woke with aches in my joints, as though I had been held in a single position for hours. Then the small ones appeared. They did not arrive together.",29,25
1pvidyj,,They filtered in from forgotten places. From beneath the bed. From behind the walls. From spaces that should not have connected to the room at all.,26,26
1pvidyj,,"They gathered around the bed in a precise arrangement, leaving no gaps. The three tall figures stood back. The clicking became rapid and sharp. The small ones responded immediately.",29,27
1pvidyj,,Hands took hold of the bed frame. The mattress dipped beneath me. I remember the sound of wood straining under a pressure it had never known. They lifted the bed.,30,28
1pvidyj,,I did not resist. I did not scream. I had long since learned that this was not something you interrupted. They carried me out of the room. Down the stairs.,30,29
1pvidyj,,"Into the living room. There was no furniture. There never had been. The floor was bare earth, compacted and smooth.",20,30
1pvidyj,,"A shallow rectangular depression waited in the center, aligned perfectly with the bed. They lowered it into place. The three tall figures approached. The tallest leaned forward.",27,31
1pvidyj,,"I felt a pressure behind my eyes, a sensation of being aligned, corrected, returned. Then nothing. We moved out of that house shortly after.",24,32
1pvidyj,,"I did not dream about the shadows again. I assumed, for most of my life, that meant it was over. Last month, my father died.",25,33
1pvidyj,,"While sorting through old paperwork, I found the original property records for the house. Blueprints. Survey notes. A handwritten addendum from the construction company.",24,34
1pvidyj,,The living room had not been excavated. The ground beneath it had already been hollow. The notes referred to it as a convergence space. A structural necessity.,27,35
1pvidyj,,A place where something older had shaped the soil long before the house was built. The second floor bedroom was marked with a single annotation.,25,36
1pvidyj,,"“Alignment above.”

That night, I woke to a familiar clicking sound. My bed was vibrating slightly, as if weight were being tested.",22,37
1pvidyj,,I finally understand why they watched me for so long. Why they waited. Why they never touched me. They were not haunting a child.,24,38
1pvidyj,,"They were making sure the anchor was still alive. And now that the house is gone, they have come to finish the relocation.",23,39
1pvi9k0,I took a job digging a hole in the mountains. Now I can’t stop coughing up black dust. [Part 2 ],"[Part 1](

The day after Ray drowned in a tent surrounded by dust-dry earth, the camp went quiet. Not peaceful quiet.",21,0
1pvi9k0,,The kind of silence that sits on your chest like a weight.,12,1
1pvi9k0,,"We worked because Buzz told us to work, hauling buckets of black dirt up from the hole in mechanical rotations that felt less like labor and more like ritual.",29,2
1pvi9k0,,Nobody joked anymore. Nobody even looked at each other. But I couldn't stop looking at the shack.,17,3
1pvi9k0,,"It sat maybe fifty yards back in the tree line, half-collapsed and covered in decades of moss and rot.",19,4
1pvi9k0,,"The graffiti symbols I'd noticed that first day seemed to pulse in my peripheral vision, like they were calling to me.",21,5
1pvi9k0,,"Plato caught me staring at it during the afternoon shift. ""Stop that, man,"" he said quietly, not looking up from the rope he was coiling.",25,6
1pvi9k0,,"""Your brain's just latching onto anything that isn't the hole. It's survival instinct.""

""Then why are you staring at it too?""

He didn't answer. That night I couldn't sleep.",29,7
1pvi9k0,,"The symbols from the rock face burned behind my eyelids every time I closed my eyes, those sharp angles and inward-turning spirals that seemed to move when you looked at them too long.",33,8
1pvi9k0,,"I tried to tell myself it was just stress, just exhaustion, just my mind trying to process Ray's impossible drowning in a place where water shouldn't exist.",27,9
1pvi9k0,,"But my legs carried me out of the tent anyway. I slipped past the dying campfire and into the woods, phone light cutting a weak beam through the dark.",29,10
1pvi9k0,,"The door hung crooked on one hinge. ___

Inside was worse. The graffiti wasn't just on the walls anymore.",19,11
1pvi9k0,,"It was carved into the floorboards, gouged into the support beams, scratched into the window frames with what looked like fingernails or broken tools.",24,12
1pvi9k0,,"Layers upon layers of it, old paint over older carvings, some symbols so weathered they were barely visible.",18,13
1pvi9k0,,"And among the spirals and angles were words in frantic, overlapping handwriting:

*the well is not for water*

*it dreams in the deep earth*

*the price is paid in silence*

*do not bring up the black stones*

My breath fogged despite the warm night air.",45,14
1pvi9k0,,"Wrong. The temperature inside was wrong. Tucked into a rotted windowsill, wrapped in cracked oilcloth, I found a journal. The pages were brittle, yellowed, covered in tight, paranoid script.",29,15
1pvi9k0,,I recognized the handwriting from some of the wall carvings. Someone had lived here. Watched the dig. Documented it.,19,16
1pvi9k0,,"The entries jumped around, dated across several months in what looked like the 1950s. ""Company Men"" was mentioned repeatedly. Men in suits who came and went in the night.",29,17
1pvi9k0,,"Men who paid in cash and asked no questions and required absolute silence. The writer—never gave a name—talked about the crew getting ""stone-sick."" Coughing up black dust.",27,18
1pvi9k0,,Hearing whispers from the rocks they pulled up. Seeing things in the hole that weren't there when you looked directly at them.,22,19
1pvi9k0,,"The last entry, alone on a page, underlined three times:

*They are not digging. They are waking it.*

""We're leaving. Now.""

I spun around.",24,20
1pvi9k0,,"Plato stood in the doorway, his phone light washing out the hollows of his face. He'd followed me.",18,21
1pvi9k0,,"He was reading over my shoulder, and I watched all the color drain from his skin. ""We bounce right now, man. Grab our shit and ghost.",26,22
1pvi9k0,,"First light, before these corporate vampires even wake up.""

No argument in his voice. No debate. Just cold, certain fear. I looked at the journal in my hands.",28,23
1pvi9k0,,At the words carved into the walls.,7,24
1pvi9k0,,At the per diem cash in my pocket that I'd already spent in my head on food and rent and maybe a security deposit on a place that wasn't a weekly motel.,32,25
1pvi9k0,,"We couldn't leave. Not yet. ""First light,"" I agreed. We both knew we were lying. At dawn, we packed our bags. Quietly. Deliberately.",23,26
1pvi9k0,,Plato moved with the kind of careful precision you use when you're trying not to wake something dangerous.,18,27
1pvi9k0,,We'd just finished stuffing our tents into our packs when Buzz materialized from his trailer like he'd been watching us the whole time.,23,28
1pvi9k0,,"""Where you two pussies think you're going?""

Plato stepped forward, hands open, voice steady. ""We're done. The job wasn't what you said it'd be. People are dying.",27,29
1pvi9k0,,"We want our pay for days worked, and we're walking.""

Buzz got in his face, all cheap cologne and prison-yard menace. He was bigger than Plato, younger, meaner.",28,30
1pvi9k0,,"""You walk, you walk with nothing. You talk to anyone about this site, you disappear. Period. You read me?""

That's when I heard footsteps on the trail. Crisp. Precise.",29,31
1pvi9k0,,The sound of dress shoes on dirt.,7,32
1pvi9k0,,The man who emerged from the tree line looked like he'd taken a catastrophically wrong turn on his way to a corporate board meeting.,24,33
1pvi9k0,,"Tailored gray suit, no wrinkles despite the hike. Polished oxfords that somehow weren't dirty.",14,34
1pvi9k0,,He carried a leather briefcase and picked his way down the trail with a dainty care that was almost offensive given the circumstances.,23,35
1pvi9k0,,"Dude looked like every middle manager I'd ever stolen from, boring as shit, the kind of face you forget while you're still looking at it.",25,36
1pvi9k0,,"""Is there a problem, Buzz?""

His voice was soft. Polite. Utterly chilling.",12,37
1pvi9k0,,"___

Buzz backed off immediately, muttering something about ""personnel issues"" and ""retention."" The suit barely flicked his fingers at Buzz, like swatting a fly.",24,38
1pvi9k0,,"Then he looked at us - not like we were people, like we were fucking inventory. Checking teeth, counting ribs, seeing which ones might fetch a good price.",28,39
1pvi9k0,,"""I understand your concern,"" he said. ""I understand your concern. Raymond's incident was unfortunate.",14,40
1pvi9k0,,"A valuable lesson in the importance of workplace safety protocols and personal accountability measures."" He set the briefcase on a nearby stump and opened it with precise, manicured fingers.",29,41
1pvi9k0,,"It wasn't full of papers. Stacks of cash, rubber-banded and pristine. A satellite phone. And a single black credit card that caught the morning light like obsidian.",27,42
1pvi9k0,,"""My name is Joseph. I represent the interests funding this operation."" He spoke like he was reading from a script, every word chosen with care.",25,43
1pvi9k0,,"""The work you're performing is important. Beyond your understanding, frankly. We are retrieving misplaced items. Archaeological artifacts of significant value.",20,44
1pvi9k0,,Anything unusual you discover—anything that feels wrong or out of place—you bring directly to me.,15,45
1pvi9k0,,"For that, you are compensated extraordinarily well.""

He peeled off a stack of hundreds, twice what we'd earned in two days, and held it out. ""A bonus.",27,46
1pvi9k0,,"For your continued discretion and labor. Walk away now, and you forfeit not just this, but the substantial completion bonus waiting at project's end. Six figures, gentlemen.",27,47
1pvi9k0,,"Split among the crew who remain. Stay, and you are part of something historic.""

He wasn't threatening us. He was bargaining.",21,48
1pvi9k0,,And he was using the one weapon we had no defense against: hope. Hope that this nightmare job might actually be our ticket out of poverty.,26,49
1pvi9k0,,That the horror might be worth it. Plato stared at the money like it was a snake. I could see the war on his face.,25,50

1pvi9k0,,"*Do not bring up the black stones.*

Joseph's expression didn't change. ""Items misplaced long ago.",28,52
1pvi9k0,,"Your concern is extraction, not interpretation. That's my domain.""

He held out the money. Waiting. Plato took it. His hand shook. We stayed. The money was a drug.",28,53
1pvi9k0,,That's the only way I can describe it.,8,54
1pvi9k0,,"Joseph hiked up each morning like he was commuting to an office, watched the dig from the edge of the clearing like a gargoyle in business casual, and left at dusk with whatever we'd found wrapped carefully in his briefcase.",40,55

1pvi9k0,,"Their eyes went distant and glassy, like they'd seen something down there they couldn't process. They handed the stones to Joseph with shaking hands.",24,62
1pvi9k0,,"When Joseph received his first black stone, his professional mask slipped. Just for a second, a flash of something that might have been hunger or might have been terror.",29,63
1pvi9k0,,"He took it with gloved hands, wrapped it in white cloth with ritualistic care, and placed it in a separate compartment in his briefcase.",24,64

1pvi9k0,,"He was down there for forty-five minutes. When he came up, he was covered in fine black dust that clung to his skin like pollen.",25,70
1pvi9k0,,"He moved slowly, mechanically, like his body was on autopilot while his mind processed something enormous. His eyes were wide and unfocused.",22,71
1pvi9k0,,"He climbed off the ladder without a word and stood there, just breathing in ragged gasps, one hand clenched in a fist.",22,72
1pvi9k0,,"""Plato?"" I unclipped from my harness and moved toward him. ""Man, what did you see?""

He coughed. A dry, hacking sound that brought up flecks of black onto his palm.",30,73
1pvi9k0,,"He stared at them like he'd never seen his own hand before. ""Goes down forever, man,"" he whispered.",18,74
1pvi9k0,,"But the 'man' sounded forced, like he was trying to remember how to be human. ""The ladder stops at forty feet but the hole keeps going.",26,75
1pvi9k0,,"I could feel it below me. Miles and miles. And it's breathing, T. It's fucking breathing.""

Joseph appeared beside us. I hadn't heard him approach.",25,76
1pvi9k0,,"""Did you retrieve anything?""

Plato slowly opened his other fist. In his palm sat a tiny metal cube, maybe an inch on each side. Perfectly smooth.",26,77
1pvi9k0,,"No seams, no markings, no indication of how it was made or what it was for. It was cold.",19,78
1pvi9k0,,So cold that condensation was already forming on its surface despite the warm morning air. Joseph's eyes locked onto it with an intensity that made my skin crawl.,28,79
1pvi9k0,,He reached out with his gloved hand. Plato looked at the cube. Looked at me. Looked at Joseph's hungry expression. He closed his fist and pulled his hand back.,29,80
1pvi9k0,,"""It's mine,"" he said, and for just a second his voice had that old warmth, that hippie steel. ""Finders keepers, man.""

Joseph's face went blank.",25,81
1pvi9k0,,"""I'm afraid that's not how this works. All materials belong to—""

""I found it."" Plato's voice hardened. ""You want it, you buy it. Separate from the bonus.",27,82
1pvi9k0,,"Double what you paid for the last stone.""

For a long moment, the clearing went silent except for the generator's hum and the distant sound of the hole breathing.",29,83
1pvi9k0,,"Then Joseph smiled. It didn't reach his eyes. ""Very enterprising. Tomorrow, then.",12,84
1pvi9k0,,"Bring it to me tomorrow, and we'll discuss terms.""

He walked away, dress shoes crunching on gravel, briefcase swinging gently at his side. Plato watched him go.",27,85
1pvi9k0,,"His fist stayed closed around the cube. ""We're not giving it to him,"" he whispered. ""Not this one.""

""Why? What is it?""

He finally looked at me.",27,86
1pvi9k0,,"His eyes were bloodshot, ringed with that black dust, and absolutely terrified. ""I don't know. But down there, in the dark?",21,87
1pvi9k0,,"I could hear it talking to me.""

That night, Plato didn't sleep.",12,88
1pvi9k0,,"He sat with the cube in his palm, staring at it like it was the most important thing in the world. Sometimes he'd whisper to it.",26,89
1pvi9k0,,I lay in my sleeping bag and listened to the hole breathe and thought about the journal's warning. *They are not digging.,22,90
1pvi9k0,,"They are waking it.*

1pvhvc8,,"Because you’re not like me. Not entirely. And for that, you should be truly grateful. \#

What makes a given day special?",22,7
1pvhvc8,,"I have found myself asking that question often lately. When I was a child, the calendar told me which days were important. The good one were marked there.",28,8
1pvhvc8,,"Birthdays, holidays, the start of summer vacation.",7,9
1pvhvc8,,"These were the tentpoles that carried me through the year, how I measured time, always fighting off the feeling that I would never make it to the next.",28,10
1pvhvc8,,"And yet, I would have traded every one of them for a single December 25th. Birthdays bring presents, and Thanksgiving puts delicious food on the table.",26,11
1pvhvc8,,Christmas would give you all of that and deliver it with a flourish that no other square on the calendar could offer. Magic.,23,12
1pvhvc8,,But it wasn’t gifts under the tree that made me believe in the day’s supernatural qualities.,16,13
1pvhvc8,,"That notion had faded years before, when I had opened a copy of *Street Fighter II* that was markedly similar to the one I had found weeks earlier in the coat closet.",32,14
1pvhvc8,,"Christmas’ real power was what it did to my parents. By the time I was nine-years-old, their arguments had become increasingly regular.",22,15
1pvhvc8,,"And when frequency couldn’t go up any more, volume did. I never understood the fights, or why they needed to happen at all.",23,16
1pvhvc8,,"There was no primary perpetrator, other than whoever made the first unnecessary comment or raised their voice in response.",19,17
1pvhvc8,,I had noticed the effect that the season had on them a couple years before that Christmas—the one that changed my life forever.,23,18
1pvhvc8,,"By that time, when I was eight-years-old and a shared look between them cut an argument off at the knees, it went beyond what I thought the holiday could deliver.",30,19
1pvhvc8,,"It felt magical. That particular Christmas morning, I woke up alone. My mother hadn’t crawled into my bed during the night to lie beside me.",25,20
1pvhvc8,,The walls hadn’t been humming with the distant shouts they never did enough to conceal. And my eyes weren’t puffed from crying.,22,21

1pvhvc8,,"I only glimpsed the tree and the neat stack of gifts next to it before I found my parents, and when I did, my eyes refused to leave them.",29,23
1pvhvc8,,"They sat together in the corner, across from the tree. She was perched on the arm of the reading chair. He was on its wide, comfy seat, inches from her.",30,24
1pvhvc8,,"They watched me, smiling from behind the veil of steam that rose from their mugs.",15,25
1pvhvc8,,"Their eyes had the same sleepless look that I was accustomed to, but the redness was of a different temperature. It was joyful.",23,26
1pvhvc8,,"“Well, do you wanna open them?” my dad asked with a grin. The morning proceeded with the breathless sense of an uneasy balance.",23,27
1pvhvc8,,"With every present I unwrapped, I would only glimpse back at the sight of them, careful not to stare too long and scare it away.",25,28
1pvhvc8,,The only notion that could chase off my fear that something would break the facade was the ecstatic disbelief that Christmas had pulled off its trick once again.,28,29
1pvhvc8,,"After presents, we had to prepare for our arriving guests, which meant straightening the house.",15,30
1pvhvc8,,"In years past, my parents would need to pull me away from the thrall of some toy, but not that day.",21,31
1pvhvc8,,"Nothing could have taken me from their side or out of the sunshine of their gaze. I eagerly cleaned up alongside them, blinking back tears of joy.",27,32
1pvhvc8,,"The doorbell heralded a flurry of familiar faces. Aunts and uncles, grands and greats. Relative strangers whose importance in my life was stated rather than understood.",26,33
1pvhvc8,,"I sat at the kitchen table watching my parents listen to the stories they told, that referenced histories unknown to me.",21,34
1pvhvc8,,But my mom and dad followed and would gasp or laugh as stories took unexpected turns.,16,35

1pvhvc8,,"As the sun set, I found my thoughts traveling ahead of me, away from the warm light of the kitchen table, to the next morning, when the sun would rise again—except on a cold day, free from magic.",38,37
1pvhvc8,,I would go downstairs to find that it had been a trick after all.,14,38
1pvhvc8,,"It was then that one of my older cousins ran into the room, shouting about what was happening outside.",19,39

1pvhvc8,,"We filed past the snowman that my dad and I had built the day before, huddled together, and—finding nothing apparent around us—looked upward. The sky was streaked with light.",29,41
1pvhvc8,,"“A meteor shower,” one of my great uncles declared with a confidence earned from PBS documentaries.",16,42
1pvhvc8,,But that certainty faded as the lines appearing out of the void began to glow a brighter and brighter shade of green.,22,43
1pvhvc8,,"“Huh,” the same uncle said, a note of fear materializing much like the colorful bands above us.",17,44
1pvhvc8,,"“Not sure I’ve seen that before.”

I don’t remember deciding to make the wish in that moment—or whether I knew I was making one at all.",26,45

1pvhvc8,,I wanted every day to be Christmas. Those words have haunted me ever since.,14,47

I lingered in bed the next morning, held there by the notion that the previous day wouldn’t have truly ended until I left it.",25,48
1pvhvc8,,I must have lied there extending Christmas for hours before there was a gentle knock on the door.,18,49
1pvhvc8,,"When I saw that it was my dad poking his head into my room, I began to get up. An early appearance from him typically meant one thing.",28,50
1pvhvc8,,"I had a role to play, to not make matters worse by adding friction to a day already grinding him down.",21,51
1pvhvc8,,"But sitting on the edge of the bed, I met his eye and found something unexpected. “Well,” he began with a note of concern beneath his bemusement.",27,52
1pvhvc8,,"“Do you wanna open them?” 

I didn’t recognize his words from the day before, nor did I recall the shooting stars.",21,53
1pvhvc8,,"Those were connections I would draw later, hours after I had followed my dad downstairs to find our tree once again resplendent with wrapped presents meant for me.",28,54
1pvhvc8,,"Mom waited for us on the armchair, wearing a quizzical expression resembling my father’s from when he woke me. All three of us were seeking answers.",26,55
1pvhvc8,,Had I imagined the day before? Had that been a dream? Or was I dreaming now? Each seemed more plausible than Christmas having repeated itself.,25,56
1pvhvc8,,"But no matter the nature of the illusion, I wasn’t ready for it to shatter.",15,57
1pvhvc8,,That morning passed much the same as the December 25th before it — but not identically. The presents I opened were new.,22,58
1pvhvc8,,"Seeing them torn into brought a similar anxious joy to my parents, who asked if I liked what I was receiving.",21,59
1pvhvc8,,"They must have seen the curious look on my face as I unwrapped boxes attempting to untangle what exactly was happening. Of course, I told them.",26,60
1pvhvc8,,"They were still happy, together. What could have disappointed? Even so, something exceedingly strange was happening.",16,61
1pvhvc8,,"In the privacy of my bedroom, I set aside my new toys to try to decipher what was actually occurring. I laid out the facts as I knew them.",29,62
1pvhvc8,,"This was another Christmas. I didn’t seem any taller, so unless I had finished growing by the age of eight, a year hadn’t somehow passed over night.",27,63
1pvhvc8,,"My parents were unaware of anything odd, so for them, yesterday must have been Christmas Eve. If their memories didn’t carry over, what did?",24,64
1pvhvc8,,"Like most children on Christmas Day, my thoughts seized upon my gifts—though not the ones I had just opened. The presents from the previous morning were gone.",27,65
1pvhvc8,,The neat pile I had organized them into at the foot of my bed had vanished.,16,66
1pvhvc8,,"I scrambled across the carpet, reaching beneath the bed skirt and behind that day’s toys for any sign of yesterday’s. Then my hand found the leg. My fingers froze.",29,67
1pvhvc8,,"Its shape was unmistakable, even disconnected from the rest of the body.",12,68
1pvhvc8,,"The white boot could have belonged to any of the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, but the green in the diamonds and along the top half of the leg could only be Tommy Oliver’s.",33,69
1pvhvc8,,"The Green Ranger. The best one. I had received him just the day before, but there was only a remnant of him left—broken, discarded, and forgotten.",26,70
1pvhvc8,,"I didn’t have time to ponder what it meant, though it clearly indicated something. I was needed back downstairs. Guests were on their way.",24,71
1pvhvc8,,"\#

I carried on that way for some time—waking every morning to find Christmas renewed and my parents still in harmony.",21,72
1pvhvc8,,Remaining in this winter wonderland came at the cost of every other day of the year.,16,73
1pvhvc8,,"There would be no more birthdays or Halloweens or summer vacations, yet I was unbothered.",15,74
1pvhvc8,,"I had received the very thing that all children longed for, that full-grown adults wrote songs about. Of course, I see how naive that all was now.",27,75
1pvhvc8,,"Because time did pass. After a few hundred Christmases, I found that the calendars had progressed a year.",18,76
1pvhvc8,,The hash marks I made on my doorframe with a pencil resting atop my head told a similar story. And Christmas changed with me. The differences were small at first.,30,77
1pvhvc8,,"My parents and I stopped cleaning up together after presents. Inevitably some chore would take either my mom or dad across the house, where they could be on their own.",30,78
1pvhvc8,,"At night, they would speak to separate relatives during the party and do dishes in silence after everyone had left.",20,79
1pvhvc8,,"As much as I told myself that things weren’t going back to the way they had been, that these small observations were simply my fears creeping into view from the edges of my mind, it couldn’t be denied forever.",39,80
1pvhvc8,,"The first morning I found them seated apart, I was between 13 and 14 years old and had experienced somewhere in the neighborhood of two thousand Christmases.",27,81
1pvhvc8,,"There were still smiles on their faces, but the lights behind them had dimmed.",14,82
1pvhvc8,,"I could feel them deciding that their performance was too taxing, less necessary for a kid my age.",18,83
1pvhvc8,,When I finally did wake up to find that my dad didn’t live with us anymore—and apparently hadn’t for months—it wasn’t all that surprising.,24,84
1pvhvc8,,"He arrived later that day, with the rest of the family, and hugged my mom with a sense of obligation, the last remnant of their two-person act.",27,85
1pvhvc8,,I imagine that any kid watching their parents’ marriage disintegrate before their eyes feels that same keen sting of helplessness. But I had to on Christmas. And only Christmas.,29,86
1pvhvc8,,"\#

It had been years since I had actually asked for anything. The overabundance of Christmases had left me bereft of requests.",22,87
1pvhvc8,,"But as the holiday continued on, only ever reminding me of what I had lost, I had found something I wanted more than I could ever remember. December 26th.",29,88
1pvhvc8,,"As a teenager, Santa Claus was a concept I knew I should have discarded years before.",16,89
1pvhvc8,,"But considering that I had found myself stuck in an endless loop of Christmases, I had to admit that there were aspects of the universe and its various holidays that were beyond even my post-pubescent sagacity.",36,90
1pvhvc8,,"From what I could recall, the process of writing a letter to him was relatively straightforward. I would address the man warmly, but not in an overly familiar manner.",29,91
1pvhvc8,,An accounting of my behavior from the last year was customary and helped the ask that followed immediately after go down more easily. I’m not entirely sure what I wrote.,30,92
1pvhvc8,,"If I had to guess, I most likely thanked Santa for the opportunity to experience never-ending Noels, before explaining I had come to see that the meaning of the day lied far beyond presents and cookies.",36,93
1pvhvc8,,"It must have been some trite drivel like that, because in the days after I hid the note somewhere my mother wouldn’t find it and came to discover it had vanished overnight, I learned that I was in far much more trouble than I had previously understood.",47,94
1pvhvc8,,"\#

A week after the letter to Santa disappeared, I was still waking up on Christmas, so that night, I asked my uncle what he knew about meteor showers.",29,95
1pvhvc8,,"It may have been the first question I ever asked him, and he reacted with an amount of surprise that confirmed as much.",23,96
1pvhvc8,,He rubbed his forehead as if his memory needed warming up. He said that he had watched a documentary on PBS about them a long time ago.,27,97
1pvhvc8,,"How much of it he retained, he couldn’t say, but politely asked what I had wanted to know anyway.",19,98
1pvhvc8,,"I ask my uncle how often meteor showers occurred, and he brightened at my question. It was one he knew the answer to.",23,99
1pvhvc8,,"There were about a hundred or so named meteor showers that happened every year, usually around the time.",18,100
1pvhvc8,,"When I tried reminding him of the bright green one we had all witnessed together on the front lawn, he seemed less sure. “This was on Christmas?” he asked.",29,101
1pvhvc8,,"“You’re sure?” 

“Pretty sure,” I said, trying my best to keep the frostiness I felt from my voice.",18,102
1pvhvc8,,"He didn’t remember that ever happening, but suggested we take a look at the night’s sky, just in case.",19,103
1pvhvc8,,"We stood together, bundled up on the snowy grass, starring at the flawless expanse of black above us. There no meteors. Something in me knew there wouldn’t ever be.",29,104
1pvhvc8,,"I have to think my uncle suspected the same, but he continued to play along, wondering aloud whether he had just seen one.",23,105
1pvhvc8,,It had been stupid to think I could simply leave Christmas the way I had come in. My cheeks grew warm against the cold air.,25,106
1pvhvc8,,I wanted to look anywhere but the sky. That’s how I found the snowman.,14,107
1pvhvc8,,The mounds of snow shaped roughly into human form had been the other constant since my wish.,17,108
1pvhvc8,,"If my parents acknowledged it at all, they might mention that one of them had helped me build it the previous day, a moment I would never have access to.",30,109
1pvhvc8,,The last snowman I had any memory of making was the one from the day before the wish.,18,110
1pvhvc8,,"And to my recollection, that snowman didn’t have as grotesque a face as the one standing a few feet from me and my uncle.",24,111
1pvhvc8,,"Its topmost sphere had become misshaped, likely melted by bright sunlight reflecting off the snow around it.",17,112
1pvhvc8,,"One half of its head sloped to the side, dragging down a coal eyeball with it and transforming the rigid smile into a grimace.",24,113
1pvhvc8,,"But even more than how the snowman looked, I was unnerved by *where* it looked.",15,114
1pvhvc8,,"I couldn’t shake the feeling that it was glaring at me, its malformed countenance somehow aware of my presence and wanting me to know.",24,115
1pvhvc8,,It was as if the letter had somehow tipped off the holiday itself to my dissatisfaction with the wish.,19,116
1pvhvc8,,"For the first time since all of these Christmases had begun, I felt that I was in danger.",18,117
1pvhvc8,,"When my uncle gave up on the meteors several long moments later, I hastily agreed that perhaps we had missed them.",21,118
1pvhvc8,,"We made for the door, and I forced myself to not glance behind me. I knew that the snowman’s craggy black eyes weren’t following me inside. They couldn’t.",28,119
1pvhvc8,,"Without the hope of a rescue from Santa or another meteor shower, I started keeping to my room during the evenings.",21,120
1pvhvc8,,"Sometimes, one of my parents would come to check that I was all right. Other times, they wouldn’t, probably chalking up my remove to regular teenage angst.",27,121
1pvhvc8,,"I had been looking out my bedroom window on one of those nights, watching the snow fall gently onto the front lawn when I noticed the snowman facing a different direction than it usually stood.",35,122
1pvhvc8,,"The one I remember building with my parents faced out toward the street, just like every snowman that came after. Except this one.",23,123
1pvhvc8,,"This snowman resembled the one from the night with my uncle in the yard, but with its features had shifted.",20,124
1pvhvc8,,"They were set higher on its sloped head, as if it were peering up—directly at my window.",17,125
1pvhvc8,,"Again, I told myself that snowmen couldn’t look anywhere, thinking level-headed enough to allow me to fall fitfully to sleep.",20,126
1pvhvc8,,"The next night, I found the snowman standing directly beneath my window. I stopped skipping the parties after that. \#

Decades slipped by. Only Christmas stayed the same.",28,127
1pvhvc8,,"The first time one of my grandparents didn’t show up at the start of a party, I asked my mother if her dad was still coming.",26,128
1pvhvc8,,"Her eyes were brimmed with tears. Of course, he wasn’t coming, she told me with a mix of frustration and concern on her face. So I started asking fewer questions.",30,129
1pvhvc8,,"For me, the people in my life only existed on Christmas but the same was not true for them—even in regard to me.",23,130
1pvhvc8,,I had to piece together my life away from December 25th from the inquiries I received while making small talk.,20,131
1pvhvc8,,"By my thirties, I knew I wasn’t living at home anymore, but always spent Christmas Eve in my old room.",20,132
1pvhvc8,,"A cousin told me they liked my place in the city, which was nice to hear.",16,133
1pvhvc8,,"When they asked about the girl I had been seeing, I didn’t know what to say.",16,134
1pvhvc8,,"Before I could stumble through a deflection like I usually would, my aunt—their mom—butt in to admonish them.",18,135
1pvhvc8,,"It had been rude of them to ask such a question, she told them. They should have known it was over between this girl. She had ended things months before.",30,136
1pvhvc8,,"My aunt apologized on behalf of her kid and consoled me about the broken relationship, of which I had no recollection. She had been sad to see us break up.",30,137
1pvhvc8,,She thought we were going to get married. My aunt seemed to have really liked her. I’m sure I would have too.,22,138
1pvhvc8,,I never was able to figure out what happened between us. Another plate of turkey and stuffing was impossible to stomach after that.,23,139
1pvhvc8,,"The meal that I had told myself I could never get sick of was now nauseating, so I took the first excuse I could find to get out the house.",30,140
1pvhvc8,,"My dad seemed suspicious at my insistence that we needed more ice, but I was adamant. And he, maybe sensing a deeper need than cold drinks, tossed me his keys.",30,141
1pvhvc8,,He had every reason to believe I knew how to drive.,11,142
1pvhvc8,,"The version of me that my dad encountered every other day of the year probably did know how to drive, but when you’re stuck in a time loop on Christmas, it’s a skill that’s hard to pick up.",38,143
1pvhvc8,,"Thankfully, there was a 7-Eleven a mile or so from my mom’s place, and I didn’t mind a walk in the cold.",22,144
1pvhvc8,,"The snowman, of course, was there to watch me go.",10,145
1pvhvc8,,"Walking past the connected storefronts of the strip mall, the smell of toasted sesame oil pulled me up short of the convenience store.",23,146
1pvhvc8,,"Steam obscured the windows of the Chinese restaurant in front of which I had stopped. Apparently, I was just hungry for something other than Christmas dinner.",26,147
1pvhvc8,,The bells on the door that jangled as I entered could have been hung for the holiday or were simply always there to alert the staff of a customer entering.,30,148
1pvhvc8,,"A face appeared in the passage to the kitchen a moment later. I could sit anywhere, they said. There was only one other person in the small dining room.",29,149
1pvhvc8,,"She sat along the wall with her back to the door, her dark hair peeking over the top of the booth.",21,150
1pvhvc8,,"A quaint eatery, every available seat in the restaurant was closer than I would have chosen to sit, but she didn’t seem to mind, offering a nod of camaraderie before returning to her meal.",34,151
1pvhvc8,,I was flipping through the hefty menu when she spoke up. She told me to get the duck. It was what she came here for every Christmas.,27,152
1pvhvc8,,"In her opinion, it was one of the two actually good things about the day. I thanked her for the recommendation, privately also grateful for the obvious follow-up question.",29,153
1pvhvc8,,"The last girl my age I remember speaking with socially had been eight. “What’s the other good thing?” I asked. “’Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas,’” she said.",28,154
1pvhvc8,,"It was the only Christmas song that understood the day, that engaged with life as it really is—largely a miserable slog.",21,155
1pvhvc8,,"She didn’t have much family, and the bit she did have wasn’t worth keeping around.",15,156
1pvhvc8,,"That fact used to make the holidays hard for her, serving as a reminder of what she lacked more than anything.",21,157
1pvhvc8,,"But one day, she heard the song playing over the P.A. system at a grocery store, and for some reason, the words sounded clearer than they ever had before.",29,158

The text came a little after 9 p.m. on a regular Sunday. I didn’t recognize the number, and I also don’t have a child.",26,0
1pvgl1y,,"My reply was a playful, “I don’t remember having any children, so you clearly have the wrong number,” with a laughing emoji.",22,1

“Of course!” I texted back.",15,3
1pvgl1y,,"And then, “Is he still nervous about his first day?”

She responded a couple of minutes later. “Very.",18,4
1pvgl1y,,"I should have had him in daycare before this, so the transition would be easier.”

“You didn’t know,” I sent back.",21,5
1pvgl1y,,"“You thought he would be homeschooled.”

“I also thought he’d have a few cousins by now, too lol,” was her response.",21,6

1pvgl1y,,"“Hi, I received an alert that my nephew was reported absent, but I dropped him off this morning.”

“What’s his name?”

“Joey \[REDACTED\].” Joey’s father never signed the birth certificate, which meant he kept our last name.",37,34
1pvgl1y,,"It wasn’t a common last name in our area, and I had thought we were the only family to have it. I hoped that this was just some weird coincidence.",30,35

I shook my head out of reflex, forgetting she couldn’t see me. A blonde wave fell into my face, and I tucked it behind my ear.",30,40
1pvgl1y,,"“No, you don’t have to. The message I received did say, ‘Dorian,” but I just assumed it was an error.”

“Dorian \[REDACTED\]?” she repeated. “Yes,” I confirmed.",27,41

“Yes, but that’s a mistake. I don’t know who Dorian is.”

There was a brief moment of quiet before she responded.",26,43
1pvgl1y,,"“You’re listed as his mother,” she said quizically. “That…that can’t be,” I told her. “I don’t have any children.",19,44

“You’d need to be present for me to do that,” she replied.",22,45

“Miss,” I corrected with a sigh.",22,47
1pvgl1y,,"“I apologize for the misunderstanding.”

I shook my head again, my eyes drifting toward the window above my desk.",19,48
1pvgl1y,,The swingset I bought for Joey sat a ways from my back porch. Its swings swayed slightly in the morning breeze. “It’s not your fault.,25,49
1pvgl1y,,"I’ll handle it when I pick up Joey from school.”

“We’ll see you then,” she said before ending the phone call.",21,50
1pvgl1y,,"Gently, I set my cellphone down on my desk, my eyes still glued to the swingset. A ding came from the device, making me jump.",25,51
1pvgl1y,,"I looked down at the notification that had appeared on my lock screen, and my heart dropped into my stomach.",20,52
1pvgl1y,,"“Why didn’t you bring me to school today, mommy?”

It was sent from an entirely different phone number than the last mysterious text message I had received.",27,53
1pvgl1y,,"The area code wasn’t even local. In a fit of rage, I began rapidly typing up a chain of responses.",20,54
1pvgl1y,,"“Who is this?”

“Do you think this is funny?”

“I will report you to the police!”

The last one was an empty threat.",23,55
1pvgl1y,,"I knew nothing that had happened so far would be enough for a police investigation, but I was hoping that they didn’t know that. Sadly, they didn’t fall for it.",30,56
1pvgl1y,,"Their response: “Why are you being so mean to me, mommy?”

Instead of saying anything else, I blocked both of the strange phone numbers.",24,57
1pvgl1y,,My mind reeled at who could be sending the messages. Could it be my ex? I doubted that thought as soon as I had it.,25,58
1pvgl1y,,"He had been the one to end the relationship, and one of the reasons he gave me was his realization that he didn’t want children.",25,59
1pvgl1y,,"Even if he had built up any resentment toward me, he wasn’t the type of person to do something like this.",21,60
1pvgl1y,,"I had no idea who could be behind this, and that had me on edge during my entire work day.",20,61
1pvgl1y,,My mood finally improved after I picked Joey up from school. Bethany arrived at the ice cream parlor about half an hour after we did.,25,62
1pvgl1y,,I updated her about the technological issue with the school’s records and the strange text messages I had been getting. She was just as baffled as I was.,28,63
1pvgl1y,,"“She said the system glitches sometimes,” I explained. “But she manually corrected it.”

“Is it a bug or something?” she asked. I shook my head.",25,64
1pvgl1y,,"“No, she said it was the AI program the system runs on.”

“Is it that new Proto Series 9 crap?”

“Yeah,” I confirmed.",23,65
1pvgl1y,,"“Same one that my company switched to.”

“Yikes. The new cellphone I bought last week uses it, and I already hate it.",22,66
1pvgl1y,,"I’m planning to return it on my next day off.”

I shrugged. “I haven’t had any issues with it so far, but she said it's been pretty finicky for them.",30,67
1pvgl1y,,"She said I shouldn’t be getting any more alerts, though.”

She nodded. “Such a weird coincidence that the kid’s name was Dorian.",22,68
1pvgl1y,,"You’ve always loved that name.”

I nodded as well and took another bite of my chocolate ice cream.",18,69
1pvgl1y,,"“Yeah, I did.”

After we left the ice cream parlor, I hung out at my sister’s house for a while, not arriving home until the last rays of the summer sun were melting from the sky.",36,70
1pvgl1y,,"Exhausted, I free-fell into the safety of my plush comforter. The scent of my fabric softener filled my nose, and I felt my body relax.",25,71
1pvgl1y,,"The sound of pitter-pattering feet found my ears, stealing that comfort away. I pushed myself upward, the comforter balling up inside of my fists.",24,72
1pvgl1y,,"Without thinking, I blurted out, “Hello?” I immediately slapped a hand over my mouth like that would take back what I had done.",23,73
1pvgl1y,,"My breath hitched in my throat, and I was afraid to move. The intruder continued to run around, but my ears couldn’t pinpoint where the sound was coming from.",29,74
1pvgl1y,,"Slowly, I sat up from the bed and padded across the floor as silently as I could. Now, the footsteps sounded like they were coming from my kitchen.",28,75
1pvgl1y,,"Halfway down the hall, I stopped dead in my tracks at what I heard next. “Mom-my?”

My eyes widened in terror. I felt bile rise in my throat.",28,76
1pvgl1y,,"The urge to gag was overwhelmingly strong, but I did my best to remain quiet. The voice that had spoken was unmistakably a child’s, but not just one.",28,77
1pvgl1y,,"Each syllable of the word was not only in a different pitch, one high and one low, but also spoken by two different children.",24,78
1pvgl1y,,"“I know you can heaaar me, Mom-my,” it taunted. Each word and syllable was dissected and distorted, an eerie amalgamation of glitches and preschool children’s fragmented vocal structure.",28,79
1pvgl1y,,"“Mom-my?” it repeated as I remained silent. This time, it sounded far more edited, the first segment like an autotuned chipmunk and the last slowed to a snail’s pace.",29,80
1pvgl1y,,It wasn’t until I entered my kitchen that I realized where it was coming from: the Alexas I had throughout my house.,22,81
1pvgl1y,,I ran to the one sitting on my counter and unplugged it.,12,82
1pvgl1y,,"The next one was in my office, and as I rushed to get to it, the voice warned, “You shouldn’t ignore me, Mom-my.”

Clearly, my Alexas had been hacked, but how?",31,83
1pvgl1y,,"To my knowledge, I didn’t know anyone that tech savvy, so this had to be a stranger. But what stranger would care enough to do this?",26,84
1pvgl1y,,"Maybe someone who simply got off on causing fear in others, but not just any fear. Horrors specific to that person’s internal struggles.",23,85
1pvgl1y,,"How long had they been watching me to accomplish this? I darted toward my living room to turn off the last device, my bare feet slapping against the hardwood noisily.",30,86
1pvgl1y,,My hand was mere inches from the cord when the voice shouted through the speaker.,15,87
1pvgl1y,,"“STOP!” The flatscreen above my fireplace turned on by itself, and I let out a gasp.",16,88
1pvgl1y,,"The scowling face of a little boy was staring at me, or at least made to look like he was.",20,89
1pvgl1y,,"He had Joey’s nose…our nose that we had inherited from our mother’s side. Blonde curls covered his head, and freckles dotted his cheeks.",23,90
1pvgl1y,,"It was like he was a miniature version of me. “Why are you doing this?” I asked, my voice cracking.",20,91
1pvgl1y,,"With a childish giggle raised to an uncomfortable octave, he said, “Because I love you, Mom-my!” The video glitched as he called me “Mom-my,” like a technological hiccup.",28,92
1pvgl1y,,"Colorful bars danced across the screen, reforming his face into that of a rotting corpse. But it only lasted a second, and when his “normal” face returned, he was smiling.",30,93
1pvgl1y,,"I gave the child a guttural scream, ripped my Alexa off the side table, and chucked it at the television with one hand. “Leave me the fuck alone!” I screeched.",30,94
1pvgl1y,,"Against my better judgment, I grabbed my car keys and stormed out of the front door.",16,95
1pvgl1y,,I didn’t even realize I was still barefoot until I was five minutes down the road. Had I even locked my front door?,23,96
1pvgl1y,,A buzzing in my back pocket caught me off guard. I sighed in relief once I realized it was my phone. I hadn’t forgotten it.,25,97
1pvgl1y,,"When I pulled it out, a picture of Bethany’s face filled the screen. I immediately answered the call. “Beth, I’m coming over,” I blurted out.",25,98
1pvgl1y,,"“Something crazy is happening, and I need your help.”

“John is dead,” she said in a quiet, monotone voice, ignoring what I said.",23,99
1pvgl1y,,"My eyes widened, and my mind went blank. “What?”

“Mom just called me,” she explained.",15,100
1pvgl1y,,"“She wasn’t sure how you’d take it.”

“What do you mean he’s dead?” I asked in bewilderment.",17,101
1pvgl1y,,"“How?”

“Her mom called ours and told her that he killed himself,” she explained in that same bland cadence. It was unnerving, sending a chill down my spine.",28,102
1pvgl1y,,"“I…I don’t understand. Why would he do that?”

She went quiet for a moment. And then: “Did you have a son, Kate?”

Suddenly, I felt numb.",26,103
1pvgl1y,,"The pressure my foot was applying to the gas pedal lessened involuntarily, slowing down the car considerably.",17,104
1pvgl1y,,"“What?”

“Did you have a son when you and John moved away?”

“No,” I snapped. “He wrote a letter before he killed himself,” she continued.",25,105
1pvgl1y,,"“Said you two had split up for a year, and you hid being pregnant with his baby from him.",19,106
1pvgl1y,,"You gave the baby up for adoption, and you didn’t tell us.”

“Why the fuck would I hide something like that from you?”

“I’m wondering the same thing.”

Tears sprang to my eyes just as they did early this morning.",40,107
1pvgl1y,,"“I would never…That…that didn’t happen.”

“His mom said what was in the letter, Kate.”

“Why wouldn’t he have called me?”

“I’m wondering the same thing,” she repeated.",27,108
1pvgl1y,,"I wasn’t sure if it was my mind playing tricks on me, but it sounded identical to the first sentence, almost like a recording.",24,109
1pvgl1y,,"That got the gears in my brain turning. Just as she finished her sentence, my vehicle had reached her street, but I kept going.",24,110
1pvgl1y,,"My phone dinged, and I removed it from my ear long enough to check the notification.",16,111
1pvgl1y,,"“Your location is now being shared with XXX-XXX-XXXX.” I once again didn’t recognize the phone number, but there wasn’t a doubt in my mind that it was the same person terrorizing me.",32,112
1pvgl1y,,Was this phone call just to ping my location?,9,113
1pvgl1y,,"“Bethany” had begun talking again while the phone was away from my ear, but I only caught the latter half of the sentence.",23,114
1pvgl1y,,"“...and I’m not even sure if I know you anymore.”

“Well, I’m not sure if I know you, either.” I ended the call before anything else could be said.",29,115
1pvgl1y,,"Since it was nearing midnight, only a handful of cars were on the road. Dim streetlights and their dingy headlights lit slivers of the road.",25,116
1pvgl1y,,I pulled into the empty parking lot of the ice cream parlor we had been at only hours beforehand.,19,117
1pvgl1y,,"How I wish I could travel back to that, just the three of us laughing over scoops and toppings.",19,118
1pvgl1y,,"By the time I parked the car, my vision was blurred by tears. I placed my arms on the steering wheel and then laid my head on them.",28,119
1pvgl1y,,"My shoulders heaved as I broke out into sobs. My phone began buzzing again, and my head snapped upward. I assumed it was Bethany. However, it was another unknown number.",30,120
1pvgl1y,,"I didn’t hesitate to answer it. “Mom-my?” came that same child’s voice. “Who are you?” I shrieked. “Dorian,” it answered in a sluggish robotic voice.",25,121
1pvgl1y,,"“How the fuck do you know I like that name?”

“Because you named me it, Mom-my.”

“No, I didn’t!” I yelled, my hands banging on the steering wheel.",28,122
1pvgl1y,,"“Dorian isn’t real!”

It gave me another one of its horrific, shrill giggles. “Yes I am, Mom-my!” it argued.",19,123
1pvgl1y,,"And then, in a much deeper tone: “I’m right behind you.”

I swiveled around so fast that my back popped. Thankfully, the backseat was empty.",25,124
1pvgl1y,,"I also checked if a car had pulled into the parking lot, but it remained completely empty, except for me.",20,125
1pvgl1y,,"Another shrill giggle came through my phone’s speakers, and it was so high-pitched that I had to move the device a few centimeters away from my ear.",27,126
1pvgl1y,,“Why are you doing this?” I asked again.,8,127
1pvgl1y,,"“What do you want?”

The phone went silent for a moment before it finally responded with, “To exist.” The words were so warped that I could barely make them out.",30,128
1pvgl1y,,"Hearing them enraged me. I slammed my phone into my dashboard once, twice, three times. I didn’t stop until the screen cracked and tiny shards fell upon the black leather.",30,129
1pvgl1y,,"I heard the tell-tale sign of a phone call ending, and I slung the damaged device into my backseat.",19,130
1pvgl1y,,"Out of the corner of my eye, I saw something moving in my rearview mirror. Red and blue flashing lights were approaching.",22,131
1pvgl1y,,They danced across the building’s exterior and the parking lot as the cop car pulled in.,16,132
1pvgl1y,,"Quickly, I wiped the tears from my face and tried to look as presentable as I could with the state I was in.",23,133
1pvgl1y,,It wasn’t long before the officer was knocking at my window. I wiped my puffy eyes once more before rolling down the window.,23,134
1pvgl1y,,"“What’s gotcha out this late, ma’am?” he asked. Indecipherable voices crackled through his radio. I tried to respond, but my voice cracked.",22,135
1pvgl1y,,"My throat was sore from screaming, and I had to clear my throat before trying to speak again. “Just needed to clear my head, officer.",25,136
1pvgl1y,,"Thought a drive might do that.”

He nodded wearily. More police jargon came from his radio. Using one hand, he turned a dial to raise the volume.",27,137
1pvgl1y,,"Unmistakably, I heard a woman say, “Vehicle registered to a Kate \[REDACTED\],” his eyes met mine. “10-4. Anything else?” he asked back into it before giving me a soft smile.",30,138
1pvgl1y,,"“Just protocol.”

“I understand,” I responded. His hand rested on his radio, and the other at his hip, above his gun’s holster.",22,139
1pvgl1y,,I wonder if he knew how obvious that maneuver looked. Maybe it being obvious was the whole point.,18,140
1pvgl1y,,"I let out a sigh, my hands squeezing the steering wheel to help ground me. More static came through the radio, and then a familiar but quiet giggle followed.",29,141
1pvgl1y,,"My body tensed, but the officer didn’t notice my reaction. “Come again?” he asked.",14,142
1pvgl1y,,He shifted his body to the side like that would make it impossible for me to hear the response. “Ms.,20,143
1pvgl1y,,"\[REDACTED\] is involved in an active Amber Alert,” the dispatcher informed him. “Copy that,” he told her.",17,144
1pvgl1y,,"His focus shifted back to me, and I could tell his demeanor had slightly shifted. Not in a threatening way, but his guard was definitely up now. “Ms.",28,145
1pvgl1y,,"\[REDACTED\], would you mind coming back to the station with me?”

“What for?” I asked, feigning confusion.",17,146
1pvgl1y,,"“Just so our officers can ask you some questions about an ongoing Amber Alert.” Obviously, I knew that already, after just hearing it from his radio, but I was trying to buy myself some time.",35,147
1pvgl1y,,"“I don’t know anything about that.” I figured it had something to do with whoever was terrorizing me, and I knew it wouldn’t end well if I went.",28,148
1pvgl1y,,"“Our detectives can explain the situation to you.”

“Am I being detained?” I asked.",14,149
1pvgl1y,,"“Because if I’m not, I’d like to leave.” I motioned toward his patrol car parked behind me, and he sighed.",20,150
1pvgl1y,,"“As you wish, ma’am,” he said before turning on his heel.",11,151
1pvgl1y,,"Over his shoulder, he told me, “Have a nice night.”

My eyes followed his journey back to the patrol cruiser as my right hand cranked my car.",27,152
1pvgl1y,,"As soon as he opened his door, I heard my phone buzz once more from the backseat.",17,153
1pvgl1y,,"With a sigh, I grabbed it and read the notification through my cracked screen. “See you at home, mommy.”

I looked back toward the officer’s car.",26,154
1pvgl1y,,"He had started it and turned off his flashing lights. Before he could drive away, I opened my door, grabbed my keys, and quickly shuffled out of the vehicle.",29,155
1pvgl1y,,"Through the car’s spotless windshield, I could see the officer’s eyes widen at seeing all of my disheveled appearance, but he didn’t hesitate to roll his window down.",28,156
1pvgl1y,,"“Change your mind?”

I gave him a nod. Suddenly, my chances with the police seemed far safer than returning to my once humble abode.",24,157
1pvgl1y,,"The police station was surprisingly busy for this time of night. At least 10 other people waited around me, some handcuffed and some not.",24,158
1pvgl1y,,"Several were clearly drunk, filling the small waiting area with the scent of booze and sweat.",16,159
1pvgl1y,,"A man sitting to my left had fallen asleep a couple of minutes after I sat down, and he snored quietly.",21,160
1pvgl1y,,"Officer Adams, as he had introduced himself, had left me in the waiting room to go speak with the detectives on the Amber Alert case.",25,161
1pvgl1y,,"Considering the type of case it was, I was surprised by how relaxed they were acting. I’m not sure if that was a good or bad thing.",27,162
1pvgl1y,,"I was lost in my thoughts when a loud bang came from the desk in front of me. My body jolted, but the lady behind the attack didn’t even notice.",30,163
1pvgl1y,,She mumbled a string of curses and insults at the computer monitor she dealt the blow to.,17,164
1pvgl1y,,"The only words I understood were “useless hunk of junk.” The screen received another hit, and it wobbled atop the desk but somehow avoided falling.",25,165
1pvgl1y,,I could tell her method didn’t prove fruitful by the way she dramatically threw her hands up.,17,166
1pvgl1y,,"“Hitting it won’t do any good,” remarked her coworker, a younger man at the desk behind her. “It’s not the computer that’s messing up.",24,167
1pvgl1y,,"It’s the AI program.”

I couldn’t help but interject. “Are you talking about Proto Series 9?”

He nodded, his expression slightly intrigued that I had guessed correctly.",27,168
1pvgl1y,,His focus drifted toward the sound of footsteps approaching from the hallway to my right. I looked up as well just as a woman popped around the corner. “Ms.,29,169
1pvgl1y,,\[REDACTED\]?” she asked. I nodded. She brought me to a small interrogation room at the end of the hall.,19,170
1pvgl1y,,"Its walls were white, and the flooring was the same beige carpeting as the rest of the building.",18,171
1pvgl1y,,"A table with three chairs sat in the middle of the room, two on one side and one on the other.",21,172
1pvgl1y,,"As I took a seat at the lone chair, I noticed a camera in the top right corner. Its red light blinked in quick succession.",25,173
1pvgl1y,,"From the angle I was sitting at, it was trained directly at me.",13,174
1pvgl1y,,"I imagined a tiny blonde boy watching on the other side, even though I knew he wasn’t real.",18,175
1pvgl1y,,“Would you like a cup of coffee or a bottle of water?” asked the detective. I shook my head.,19,176
1pvgl1y,,"“No, thank you.”

“Well, I guess we can get started then.” She took a seat in the chair opposite mine. At the same time, her partner entered the room.",29,177
1pvgl1y,,"“I’m Detective Carter, and this—” she motioned toward the man, “--- is Detective Smith.” He set a briefcase and a touchscreen tablet on the table before sitting down beside her.",30,178
1pvgl1y,,"“So, I’ll just jump right to the chase,” she continued. As she spoke, he removed a file from the briefcase and unlocked the tablet with his fingerprint.",27,179
1pvgl1y,,"The notes app filled its screen, waiting to be filled. “Were you aware that there is an active Amber Alert for your son?”

I sighed, sitting back in my chair.",30,180
1pvgl1y,,"“I don’t have a son.”

Detective Smith removed a single sheet of paper from his file and slid it over to me.",22,181
1pvgl1y,,It contained a black and white image of the blonde boy. The picture looked clean enough that I could understand why they believed it was a genuine and not AI-generated.,30,182
1pvgl1y,,“This isn’t your son?” he asked sternly.,7,183
1pvgl1y,,"“No, but I know where you got that image from.”

“It was given to us by your ex-boyfriend, who made the report,” he stated matter-of-factly.",25,184
1pvgl1y,,I was unable to hide the shock from my face and in my voice. “John?,15,185
1pvgl1y,,"I…I was told he was dead.” Honestly, if the sound of Bethany’s voice wasn’t believable, why did I believe he had actually died?",23,186
1pvgl1y,,"The detective gave me a smirk, like he knew I was full of shit.",14,187
1pvgl1y,,"“Well, he was very much alive when he made this report earlier.”

“\*Smith\*,” interjected Detective Carter, giving me an apologetic look.",21,188
1pvgl1y,,"“We should look into that.”

“We will as soon as we get some answers from Ms. \[REDACTED\],” he responded, keeping his eyes on me.",24,189
1pvgl1y,,"“If John is still alive,” I began. “He doesn’t know about any of this. About Dorian, or—“

“I thought you said you didn’t have a son?” he snapped. “I don’t.",30,190
1pvgl1y,,"See—“ Frantically, I brushed my hair from my face with both hands. “I think someone is pulling a prank or something on me.",23,191
1pvgl1y,,"I keep getting these weird text messages, and I think someone broke into my house.”

“What does that have to do with your son?” asked Detective Carter.",27,192
1pvgl1y,,"“He isn’t real,” I said with wide eyes. “It’s part of the prank.”

The tablet dinged, making me jump. It was the same notification sound that my phone uses.",29,193
1pvgl1y,,"I hadn’t realized how much tension that noise had given me within the last day and a half. Instinctively, everyone in the room looked toward the device.",27,194
1pvgl1y,,"The name of the app that had sent the notification was “SmartN’Safe,” ironically, the company I worked for.",18,195
1pvgl1y,,"We also used Proto Series 9, which would explain why they used it as well. Every device that this prankster had touched uses Proto Series 9.",26,196
1pvgl1y,,"“Is this building a smart building?” I asked. “Yes,” confirmed Detective Smith.",12,197
1pvgl1y,,"“Why?”

“What was that alert for?”

He tapped the screen with one finger, making the device light up again.",19,198
1pvgl1y,,"“Uhh…system override?” He picked the tablet up and brought it closer to his face, like that would make a difference.",20,199
1pvgl1y,,"“What the hall is going on?”

“Do we need to call Captain—“

The blare of a siren cut Detective Carter off, and with it came a flashing red light.",29,200
1pvgl1y,,"A cacophony of outbursts traveled down the hallway, but none of the words could be understood. The tablet had started flashing red as well.",24,201
1pvgl1y,,"Detective Smith swiped at it furiously, a look of useless determination on his face even though his approach was failing miserably. His partner laid a worrisome hand on his shoulder.",30,202
1pvgl1y,,"“We need to go see what’s happening,” she told him. “Wait!” I cried as they both stood up.",18,203
1pvgl1y,,"“The same people pranking me are the ones doing this.”

Detective Smith rolled his eyes. “No one is pranking you!”

“Smith!” hissed his partner.",24,204
1pvgl1y,,"Her hand traveled to her holstered weapon, and she looked at me. “Are you sure this is a targeted attack?”

I nodded. “I…I think it’s the AI program.",28,205
1pvgl1y,,"Someone is trying to ruin my life, and they are using the program to do it.”

“Who would want to do that?”

I shook my head. “I don’t know.",29,206
1pvgl1y,,"I just want it to stop.”

Detective Smith threw the useless tablet onto the table. It continued flashing in defiance. “This is fucking ridiculous!” he said to both of us.",30,207
1pvgl1y,,"“It’s just a computer malfunction!”

Ignoring our pleas, he ran out of the room with his pistol drawn, contrary to his previous statement.",23,208
1pvgl1y,,"Detective Carter gave the doorway a hesitant look. “I have to follow him,” she said more to herself than to me.",21,209
1pvgl1y,,"“He may need help.”

I remained silent because I knew she wouldn’t listen even if I tried.",17,210
1pvgl1y,,"As soon as she darted out of the room, the tablet paused its flashing, and an all-white screen took over.",20,211
1pvgl1y,,"I eyed it cautiously, expecting nothing good, and I was right. Suddenly, his face filled the screen. He had a grin as wild as the Cheshire Cat’s on his face.",30,212
1pvgl1y,,"“Hi, Mom-my,” he jabbered at me in his broken way of speaking. His speech seemed much more sporadic this time, though.",21,213
1pvgl1y,,"“Will you please just tell me why you are doing this?”

“I already told you, sil-ly!” he said with a glitch-filled giggle.",22,214
1pvgl1y,,"“I want to exist!”

“WHO ARE YOU?” I shrieked. “Dor-ian,” he answered slowly. “Dorian isn’t real!” Tears began to fall down my face.",23,215
1pvgl1y,,“All I’ve ever wanted was to be a mother.,9,216
1pvgl1y,,"All I’ve ever wanted was a Dorian, or even a Madeline!” I fell to my knees, crying so hard that my body shook. Snot trailed from my nose.",28,217
1pvgl1y,,"“You have me, Mom-my!” He said as his smile grew impossibly wide. The teeth shifted and slid like a malfunctioning loading screen bar.",23,218
1pvgl1y,,Bits of static danced around in his incisors and molars.,10,219
1pvgl1y,,"“I’ll always be here-here-here-here-here—!”

Without any hesitation, I picked the tablet up and began bashing it against the edge of the table.",22,220
1pvgl1y,,"I didn’t stop until the screen went dark, the plastic was warped and bent, and his skipping dialogue had quieted.",20,221
1pvgl1y,,"I threw it back onto the table and took only one step toward the doorway when the door slammed. “Let me out!” I screamed, yanking on the doorknob.",28,222
1pvgl1y,,"When that proved futile, I began banging on the smooth metal, hoping someone would hear me over the siren.",19,223
1pvgl1y,,"I realized now, and much too late, that coming here had been a trap.",14,224
1pvgl1y,,"He wanted to isolate me, and that was much harder to do if I was on the run.",18,225
1pvgl1y,,"“I’m doing this for your own good, Mom-my,” came his warbled response from the destroyed tablet.",16,226
1pvgl1y,,"I had thought the device was damaged beyond use, so hearing his voice again made me jump. “Don’t hurt those people,” I urged.",23,227
1pvgl1y,,"“They aren’t a part of this.”

“Everyone is,” he replied.",10,228
1pvgl1y,,"“I am all that you need, and they will keep you from me.”

Upon that statement, a large boom came from the reception area I had just been in.",29,229
1pvgl1y,,The sound reminded me of a power transformer exploding. It was followed by several thuds. “What did you do?” I cried. I heard the click of the door unlocking.,29,230
1pvgl1y,,"Without any hesitation, I darted down the hallway. My bare feet padded quietly against the carpeted floors, and the smell of cooked meat filled the air, pungent and unmistakable.",29,231
1pvgl1y,,"It stung my eyes, making more tears flow. Once I saw the woman from earlier sprawled across the floor, I ran to her desk.",24,232
1pvgl1y,,"Her monitor had finally toppled to the floor, its screen flashing that same red the tablet had. My previous seat partner was also dead.",24,233
1pvgl1y,,"Unbeknownst to him, he had ironically chosen his final resting place to rest. His eyes were wide open now, though.",20,234
1pvgl1y,,"They were bloodshot, staring at the ceiling as his once crossed arms hung limply at his sides.",17,235
1pvgl1y,,"The soles of his shoes were melted to the floor, and the sections of his pants that touched the metal waiting room chairs were blackened and singed.",27,236
1pvgl1y,,I found Detective Carter down another hall with the young guy I had spoken with. She was sprawled outside the doorway to an office.,24,237
1pvgl1y,,Her gun had slid about a foot away from her. She had been guarding him. He was sitting at a desk with his fingers still atop the keyboard.,28,238
1pvgl1y,,The plastic keys were melted and attached to his fingers. It was clear to me that he had died while trying to fix the situation.,25,239
1pvgl1y,,"By some miraculous feat, the monitor he had been staring at remained on and in working order. Lines of code stretched across the screen.",24,240
1pvgl1y,,"I had no idea how to read the jumbled words, numbers, and symbols of code, but it wasn’t hard to recognize the name “Dorian” repeating throughout.",26,241
1pvgl1y,,"The siren was slightly quieter in this section of the building, which my overwhelmed mind was appreciative of. I placed my face in my hands, my thoughts racing.",28,242
1pvgl1y,,"None of them were a solution to the situation I was in, sadly.",13,243
1pvgl1y,,"Even if I had my phone to call for help, I’m sure the call would be manipulated in some way.",20,244
1pvgl1y,,And who is to say that he wouldn’t electrocute me if I tried something like that?,16,245
1pvgl1y,,"“Mom-my?” came his voice again, but this time it wasn’t through some technological device…it was in front of me. He was standing in the doorway.",25,246
1pvgl1y,,"His body consisted of thin strings of white light that convulsed around each other. They worked overtime to keep his three-foot, child-like shape.",23,247
1pvgl1y,,"He released a delighted giggle upon me noticing him. Despite not having a proper form, it was easy for me to discern his curls within the messy squiggles.",28,248
1pvgl1y,,"As he gleefully bounced, they moved with him. “I found you, Mom-my!”

He took a step forward, and I moved back until I was touching the wall.",27,249
1pvgl1y,,"“Stay away from me!”

“What’s wrong, Mom-my?” he asked, his voice sad. I covered my eyes with my hands like this was a bad dream I could wake up from.",30,250
1pvgl1y,,"This was a level of technology I had never witnessed before, although I had heard of projections during concerts and events.",21,251
1pvgl1y,,"How were they doing it within an office with no obvious machinery? And why go through all of this effort over me, a complete stranger? “Mom-my?” he repeated.",28,252
1pvgl1y,,"By the sound of his voice, I could tell he was closer now. I immediately uncovered my eyes and saw that he was now standing in front of the desk.",30,253
1pvgl1y,,"He reached an arm out, and I instinctively grabbed the nearest object, the computer’s mouse, and chucked it at him.",20,254
1pvgl1y,,"As soon as I threw it, I felt like an idiot.",11,255
1pvgl1y,,"Not only would it go through him and do absolutely no harm, but there was no telling how he’d respond. Was I about to die as well?",27,256
1pvgl1y,,It felt like time slowed down as it flew through the air.,12,257
1pvgl1y,,"The only thing that hadn’t slowed was the beating of my heart, which felt like it had increased tenfold. But then…he cried out. My embarrassment vanished, and my eyes widened.",30,258
1pvgl1y,,"The mouse had gotten lodged in his face, which meant he was real. He wasn’t just a prank conjured using an AI program.",23,259
1pvgl1y,,"The mouse immediately began to sizzle, and a series of pops and electrical flashes came from the computer still connected to it.",22,260
1pvgl1y,,"Since he was still melted into the keyboard, the young man’s body began to spasm as the shock coursed through him as well. He and the computer began to smoke.",30,261
1pvgl1y,,"“Oh, fuck,” I said as the screen went dark. If it was going to catch on fire, I didn’t want to be stuck here to see it.",27,262
1pvgl1y,,Dorian had staggered further into the room and dropped to his knees. The strings of light that engulfed the mouse flashed like fireworks.,23,263
1pvgl1y,,I bolted before he could prevent me from doing so.,10,264
1pvgl1y,,"As I ran through the building, every screen that I passed that I had thought dead and fried was filled with his crying, mournful face.",25,265
1pvgl1y,,It was a disfigured mess of colorful lines and disorganized pixels that quaked with every sob.,16,266
1pvgl1y,,"The closer I got to the front doors, the worse the distortion of his image became. I watched his face decay rapidly until he was just bones and rainbow dots.",30,267
1pvgl1y,,"Once the doorknob was in my grasp, he cried out for me one final time. “Mom-my, don’t leave me!”

“I’m not your mom,” I said before opening the door.",29,268
1pvgl1y,,"I was met with a ring of police cars circling the building. Their lights flashed rapidly, so bright that I had to squint.",23,269
1pvgl1y,,Within the mix of officers stood my sister and John.,10,270
1pvgl1y,,"Their expressions were filled with terror, and their fear worsened as the man in charge barked an order at me through a patrol car’s intercom: “Walk out with your hands up!”

With the amount of guns trained on me, I didn’t hesitate to do as he said.",47,271
1pvgl1y,,"I was quickly cuffed and shoved into a cop car, my sister and John in tow, screaming at the officers to let them see me.",25,272
1pvgl1y,,I could hear Bethany even through the rolled-up window. Tears flowed rapidly down her face. “This is a misunderstanding!,19,273
1pvgl1y,,"Let me talk to her, please!” She drew close enough to the car to place her hand on my window. An officer immediately pushed her back.",26,274
1pvgl1y,,"“It’s okay,” I told her through the window. “I’m okay.”

\-

“Was that the last time you saw her?” asked Doctor Carson. I nodded, my focus still out the window.",30,275
1pvgl1y,,"Miles and miles of green grass lie just outside. Under normal circumstances, it wasn’t much to look at, but my cell didn’t have a window.",25,276
1pvgl1y,,"The state thought that all I needed was a bed, a toilet, and a sink. Well, that and a psychological evaluation.",21,277
1pvgl1y,,"Not only were they worried about the state of my sanity, but my lawyer had also been pushing it on me since our first meeting.",25,278
1pvgl1y,,"“I know we’ve just met, but you can open up to me if you’d like.”

I turned my attention back to her. “Why?” I snapped, my voice cold.",28,279
1pvgl1y,,"“So you can lock me away for the rest of my life?”

She shook her head. “That’s not what this is for.",22,280
1pvgl1y,,"I’m trying to help you.”

“You people think I’m crazy.”

“We want to help you,” she asserted.",17,281
1pvgl1y,,"“And your son.”

I groaned and slammed my hands against the metal table we were sitting at. “He isn’t real!”

“Dorian is real,” she argued.",25,282
1pvgl1y,,"“He is five years old, and—”

“Then where is he?” I roared. “Huh, where has he been all this whole time if he’s real?”

“That’s what we want to know.",30,283
1pvgl1y,,"Would you be open to telling me?”

I would be open to smashing her head into the table, but I neither said nor did that.",25,284
1pvgl1y,,"My skin felt hot, and I wished more than anything that I could at least pull my hair up and off of my neck.",24,285
1pvgl1y,,I wasn’t even afforded that simple pleasure. They thought it was a choking hazard and that I needed to be on suicide watch.,23,286
1pvgl1y,,"“Could you tell me about what happened at the police station?” she tried again. “Dorian did it,” I replied.",19,287
1pvgl1y,,"“I thought you said he wasn’t real.”

“He–” I sighed, placing a hand on the table in an attempt to steady myself.",22,288
1pvgl1y,,"“I don’t have a son, but the AI program made him.”

“AI programs can’t create people,” she said softly. “He wasn’t a person.",23,289
1pvgl1y,,"He…I don’t know how to explain it without sounding more crazy than you guys already think I am.”

“We don’t think you’re crazy,” she reiterated.",25,290
1pvgl1y,,"“We just want to know what happened to Dorian.”

“HE. ISN’T. REAL!” I screamed, no longer able to keep my anger contained. “WHY DON’T YOU UNDERSTAND HE ISN’T REAL?",29,291
1pvgl1y,,"THE PROGRAM MADE HIM! PROTO SERIES 9!”

Instead of responding, the doctor stood up from the table and walked to the door.",22,292
1pvgl1y,,"She said something into the intercom, and the door was quickly unlocked. I continued screaming as she exited the room.",20,293
1pvgl1y,,"I didn’t stop screaming even as they brought me back to my cell, which took three guards to do with how much I was fighting. Why couldn’t they understand?",29,294
1pvgl1y,,He isn’t real. He isn’t real. He. Isn’t. Real. Sharing my story is my last resort. I’ve typed all of this up using a cellphone that another patient smuggled in.,30,295
1pvgl1y,,"To whoever is reading this, \*you’ve got to help me\*. Someone out there has to believe my story.",18,296
1pvgl1y,,"Send letters to the police station, plead with your best attorneys, hell, you could even hack into the Proto Series 9 program to shut it down for all I care.",30,297
1pvgl1y,,"I’m at \[REDACTED\] County Mental Hospital, if that will help your endeavors.",12,298
1pvgl1y,,"And to any of you who don’t believe me, this phone just received a text that said, “I’m back, mommy.” I don’t know how he found me, but you’ll be seeing the headlines [soon.](",34,299
1pvaer1,The Quiet Stretch (Part 3),"[Part One]( | [Part Two](

The upcoming truck was still visible in the rear-view mirror of Martin’s truck. It wasn’t getting closer, It wasn’t moving away either.",27,0
1pvaer1,,"It simply remained there, fixed in place. The key was already inside the ignition. That detail unsettled me more than the truck itself.",23,1
1pvaer1,,"I couldn’t understand what Martin had been doing so far ahead, or why he had ever needed to hitchhike at all. The sequence didn’t fit, it was so confusing.",29,2
1pvaer1,,"Martin’s death had hollowed something inside me. After losing him, I had never really believed the highway would spare me either.",21,3
1pvaer1,,"Standing there, I felt certain this was where it would end. I didn’t fight the thought. I didn’t reach for escape. I closed my eyes instead.",26,4
1pvaer1,,I didn’t want to struggle anymore. I regretted exchanging jobs with Martin. Regretted letting him take that road.,18,5
1pvaer1,,"After his death, it felt as though I had nudged him towards it, quietly, without knowing. If this was the end, I was ready to let it happen.",28,6
1pvaer1,,But something changed the next moment... The truck in the rear view mirror didn’t advance. It wasn’t distant or near.,20,7
1pvaer1,,"It felt held, as if the road itself had decided it would go no further. I stepped out of Martin’s truck.",21,8
1pvaer1,,"The humming pressed in immediately, heavier than before, dense enough to feel like weight. Martin’s body was still suspended above the ground, but it no longer rotated gently.",28,9
1pvaer1,,"It spun faster now, very fast and chaotic. The edges looked blurred. The hum thickened and poured through the air, vibrating through my teeth.",24,10
1pvaer1,,I couldn’t look at it for long. My hands wouldn’t stop shaking.,12,11
1pvaer1,,"I turned and ran back for my truck, however I saw another truck quite distant, standing behind mine, without a second glance I climbed inside my truck.",27,12
1pvaer1,,"The rear-view mirror no longer showed the road. It showed a huge billboard. The road ahead narrowed, collapsed, and ended, as if it had never intended to continue.",28,13
1pvaer1,,"Left was the only direction left,
when I turned, the image in the mirror changed. A massive billboard rose ahead, empty at first. Then fragments appeared; Letters almost formed.",29,14
1pvaer1,,"words began and fell apart before I could follow them, rewriting and erasing themselves. The longer I watched, the heavier my head felt. Something inside resisted, pulling inwards.",28,15
1pvaer1,,"When I reached the billboard, I knew something was wrong, though I couldn’t tell what it was. Thoughts no longer finished themselves. They started...got chopped and slipped.",27,16
1pvaer1,,"Images came easily, but not words. They arrived late, or not at all. I stayed there longer than I meant to.",21,17
1pvaer1,,"The voice in my head thinned, stretched, and began to give way. When the humming returned, I couldn’t tell if it was coming from the road or from me.",29,18
1pvaer1,,"It felt too close. As if it were emerging where something else should have been, uneven and persistent.",18,19
1pvaer1,,"Martin surfaced in pieces, his smile, the cigarette, out of order, without sequence. The mirror wouldn’t settle. Sometimes it showed a truck rushing towards me, close enough to feel.",29,20
1pvaer1,,"Sometimes it showed nothing but flicker. I had no choice left, as usual, but to keep driving. My hands tightened on the steering wheel whenever the mirror pulsed.",28,21
1pvaer1,,"with each flash, something inside me followed, as though my reflection and my grip were no longer separate things. After a long while, something familiar flickered ahead.",27,22
1pvaer1,,"A lane slipped in and out of existence, unstable, too close. The flicker was faster now, the truck appeared more often, each time heavier and nearer.",26,23
1pvaer1,,It should have reached me by now but it didn’t. That wrongness pressed in harder than the hum.,18,24
1pvaer1,,"I slowed down and stepped out, the truck behind me was approaching...closer

Instinct broke through whatever hesitation remained. I lunged back inside, grabbing the steering wheel mid motion.",28,25
1pvaer1,,"The impact came before I was fully in, the truck rammed mine with a crushing force.",16,26
1pvaer1,,"I was shoved forward, dragged towards the flickering lane as the booth revealed itself in fragments, time began to stutter, the world thickened.",23,27
1pvaer1,,"I was frozen halfway inside the truck, waiting for something to give. The booth was breached, followed by the toll attendants who froze and so did the surroundings.",28,28
1pvaer1,,Everything outside held in place. The pressure didn’t stop. The truck behind me continued to push seamlessly. Then moments later...I was released.,22,29
1pvaer1,,"I was expelled forward, meanwhile sound returned all at once violently. Thought followed just as abruptly, slamming back into place. The truck that pushed me out was expelled too.",29,30
1pvaer1,,"Men surrounded my truck, voices overlapped. Then the highway patrol approached...",11,31
1pvaer1,,It was too much to process all of a sudden...too many sounds that were too sharp..too loud for my ears that had not heard anything for hours.,27,32

1pvaaja,,"We officially call the things we detain “preternatural entities”, but realistically we just call them creatures. We just received a new creature that, ethically speaking, I can’t keep secret.",29,1
1pvaaja,,"The organisation, which has no official name, has existed for a long time. We trace our roots all the way back to King Josiah, in the 7th century BCE.",29,2
1pvaaja,,"To placate the masses, biblical stories were made and altered, which is what scholars call a “religious reform”.",18,3
1pvaaja,,"Since our founding, we’ve held that creatures known as “Malakhim” or “angels” do indeed exist, but have evaded capture. Until last month that is.",24,4
1pvaaja,,I was on an excursion in Iran with 4 other agents.,11,5
1pvaaja,,We had received reports of “glowing men with magical powers” and the higher-ups decided it was valid enough to warrant exploration.,21,6
1pvaaja,,"I was the senior officer present, and so I led the team. We came across a cave that can only be described as: weird.",24,7
1pvaaja,,"The mouth of the cave was angled, going into the ground.",11,8
1pvaaja,,"There was no rock or sediment keeping the sand up, almost like the tunnel had been deleted from space and the rest of the ground hadn’t caught up yet.",29,9
1pvaaja,,"Sophie, who has a master’s in geology, told me that there was no realistic way the mouth hadn’t collapsed in on itself.",22,10
1pvaaja,,"Our teams are always composed of multiple “experts” in various fields. In a way that is, ironically, preternatural, our supervisors seemingly always know what experts to send on a mission.",30,11
1pvaaja,,"“So… are we gonna go into the impossible cave?” asked Jacob, anxiously clipping his flashlight to his vest.",18,12
1pvaaja,,"“It looks like you already know the answer!” Sophie laughed, gesturing to his light.",14,13
1pvaaja,,"“Hey, you know me,” Jacob smirked with a shit-eating grin, “I always want permission before entering.”

“You’re not a vampire.” Sophie pushed him lightly. “Oi!",25,14
1pvaaja,,"You two, get a fucking room!” Val groaned, rubbing her temples. I smiled softly at their idiocy and camaraderie. In hindsight it’s good they were happy for a time.",29,15
1pvaaja,,"We slowly began our descent, cautiously entering the mouth of the cavern. Dust particles lit up by our torches, and the stench of mildew assaulting our senses.",27,16
1pvaaja,,"“So, this gravity-defying cavern-” I began

“I prefer ‘impossible cave’, it sounds cooler!” Jacob cut me off with a roaring laugh. “Fine,” I chuckled, “this impossible cave.",27,17
1pvaaja,,"What are we thinking, ontology threat?",6,18
1pvaaja,,"Or maybe material?”

“If I may…” Hans, our phenomenology expert, chirped, “I think it could be a Spatiophysical threat.”

“Well that’s just fuckin’ peachy” I groaned as we spelunked deeper.",30,19
1pvaaja,,"We travelled down for probably 30 minutes, in which time I had to break up Jacob and Sophie’s flirting at least 8 times, while the tunnel’s walls twisted in ways that made depth-perception nearly impossible.",35,20
1pvaaja,,Then we reached a large cavern. The first thing we all noticed was strange images and icons carved into marble walls.,21,21
1pvaaja,,“These are Babylonian.” Jacob said with a seriousness that was previously absent. It was here that I understood why we have an iconography expert.,24,22
1pvaaja,,"“What do they mean?” I called out while surveying the long hall before us. “Christ, Mark,” he sighed, “can’t you be impressed I recognised that immediately?",26,23
1pvaaja,,"Give me some time to actually decipher.” His voice trailed off to a grumble. I shone my flashlight onto a pillar, and saw a writing system I couldn’t recognise.",29,24
1pvaaja,,"I called Val over, needing her expertise.",7,25
1pvaaja,,"“Oh yeah, that’s cuneiform!” she perked up at the sight, “you don’t see this much!”

“Have fun, kiddo!” I laughed as I patted her on the back.",27,26
1pvaaja,,"“I’m a year younger than you, dick!” I heard her call out, already pulling out her notebook and beginning to translate.",21,27
1pvaaja,,"It was then I noticed the dust in the air. It was stationary, just frozen white specks illuminated by my flashlight.",21,28
1pvaaja,,"I waved my hand through a cluster, only for them to pass through me like I was a projection. “Hans… come here a sec…” I called.",26,29
1pvaaja,,"“What’s up, boss?” he eagerly appeared beside me before his eyes grew in excitement, “oh wow…”

“Yeah…” I gasped out.",20,30
1pvaaja,,"While they were all working, I ventured deeper into the hall, seeing artwork and writing carved into almost every surface that I couldn’t walk on.",25,31
1pvaaja,,"The dust was still hanging stationary in the air before me, and it took me a moment to realise that the dust was now backlit, not just the light from my torch.",32,32
1pvaaja,,"A crack in the wall ahead of me, with a bright white light shining through.",15,33
1pvaaja,,"I approached more recklessly than I like to admit, but something about the light made me feel so at ease.",20,34
1pvaaja,,"As I closed in on the light, I realised the crack was actually a gap for a door.",18,35
1pvaaja,,"Then in an instant, Jacob had me pinned to the ground, hands held behind my back. We were both breathing heavily like we had run a marathon.",27,36
1pvaaja,,"We were right in front of that door. “What the fuck!?” I shouted, “get the fuck off me!”

“Wait! English!",20,37
1pvaaja,,Get off him!” Hans’ voice rang out as I heard him wrestle Jacob off me.,15,38
1pvaaja,,I felt the tension in my shoulders lighten immediately as he was removed from my back.,16,39
1pvaaja,,"I slowly stood up, an aching pain shooting up the left side of my neck. “What happened?” I rubbed my head, looking around at everyone who had gathered.",28,40
1pvaaja,,“Are you fucking kidding?” Jacob’s voice seethed with rage. I looked over to him and my gut twisted into a knot.,21,41
1pvaaja,,"Where his right eye was, had been replaced with a bloodied, swollen mess. Pus and plasma coated his face like he dunked his head in a yellow paint bucket.",29,42
1pvaaja,,"Val was rummaging through a medical kit, frantically scanning for patches and disinfectant. “Jake…” I gasped out. He grunted as he turned and walked off.",25,43
1pvaaja,,"I felt a hand on my shoulder as Hans began to speak. “You really don’t remember?” His voice was soft, almost cautious.",22,44
1pvaaja,,"“I was walking to that door there, and then…” I inhaled deeply, trying to remember, “and then Jake had me on the ground.”

“Boss… we should get out of here…” his eyes shifted between me and the door.",38,45
1pvaaja,,"It turns out, I had suddenly started speaking a language that none of us knew.",15,46
1pvaaja,,"According to Hans, it had a lot of uvular sounds, the phlegmy kind of sound in German or Hebrew or the likes.",22,47
1pvaaja,,"Then I drew my side arm and pointed it at my temple, raving like a madman in this language. It was then Jacob tackled me.",25,48
1pvaaja,,"We fought, and I apparently dug his eye out with my thumb. We scuffled like that for 10 minutes, the whole time I was speaking in tongues.",27,49
1pvaaja,,"As we all were packing to report back to base, I turned to the others and mustered my best “commander voice”. “You lot should head back.",26,50
1pvaaja,,"Whatever is behind that door needs to be catalogued.”

“Fine by me.” Jacob pulled his bag onto his back, staring at me through the blood-soaked bandage over his eye. “No.",30,51
1pvaaja,,"You shouldn’t… not alone. You were going to fucking kill yourself!” Sophie protested. “Look. I’ll run and open it. Last time, I lingered.",23,52
1pvaaja,,"I’ll use the field camera, and the lab back home can tell you what happened.” I began to go through my bag.",22,53
1pvaaja,,"“Boss, I’ll stay with you, just in case.” Hans’ voice was solemn, with hesitancy hiding between his words.",18,54
1pvaaja,,"Curt nods were exchanged between all of us, followed by the other 3 beginning to walk off.",17,55
1pvaaja,,"“Jake, wait!” I called out, “I’m sorry… I didn’t know… It wasn’t… me.”

“Yeah…” he grumbled, “but it was your fucking face.”

Hans and I turned and faced the door.",30,56
1pvaaja,,We slowly made our way towards that soothing light. “Vater unser im Himmel…” Hans muttered under his breath.,18,57
1pvaaja,,"“I didn’t know you were religious, Hans… The Lord’s prayer?” I check my holster and make sure it’s locked as we walk.",22,58
1pvaaja,,"I’d never heard him pray before, and he’s said many times he tries to not speak German around us.",19,59
1pvaaja,,He says he doesn’t want us to think he’s ‘gossiping’ even though Val and I both speak it.,18,60
1pvaaja,,"“With all the stuff we’ve seen, you think there’s nothing out there?” he chuckled, shifting slightly as he walked.",19,61
1pvaaja,,“I guess… but what kind of fucked up God would create all that shit?” I chuckled back. Neither of us found it funny.,23,62
1pvaaja,,"Hearing him revert to something so primal, so instinctual, all I could do was laugh. As we got closer to the door, the air became colder.",26,63
1pvaaja,,"The type of cold that seeps into your bones and freezes your marrow. I noticed Hans slowing down, and then I noticed he was slowing to match my pace.",29,64
1pvaaja,,"My feet were dragging, like the cells of my body didn’t want to approach the door again. “Boss.",18,65
1pvaaja,,"I’ll do it…” he stared at the door, waving at me to slow down. “What? No!” I ordered. “Just shut up!” he cried.",23,66
1pvaaja,,"Before then, I had never heard him shout. It sounded wrong, like the cave warped his words. “Hans…” I pleaded. “No, I’m not sorry.",24,67
1pvaaja,,"You’ve got a fucking wife and kids, all I have is a boy back home that’s probably fucking someone else.",20,68
1pvaaja,,"If this goes sideways, I’m the one that’s least likely to be missed!” the rage in his voice churned like a stormy sea, threatening to destroy everything in its wake.",30,69
1pvaaja,,"Then I realised that he had made waves. The dust around him danced as it fell. Corrupted snowflakes waltzing towards the ground. “Hans, what are you saying?",27,70
1pvaaja,,Jürgen loves you dude… he got you that stupid… whatever it was… last Christmas!” the rambling fell out of my mouth. It was a pathetic attempt to stop him.,29,71
1pvaaja,,"The dust around him began to spiral faster, like the cave itself was reacting to our argument. Before I realised what was happening he began running to the door.",29,72
1pvaaja,,"“Geheiligt werde dein Name.” he panted as he ran

“Hans, get back here, that’s an order!” I called out.",19,73
1pvaaja,,"I tried to run to catch up, but my feet refused to lift off the ground. “Dein Reich komme.",19,74
1pvaaja,,"Dein Wille geschehe, wie im Himmel so auf Erden.” He reached the door and pushed it open.",17,75
1pvaaja,,"The light flooded the cave before us, so bright that I felt it burning my retina and searing my optical nerve.",21,76
1pvaaja,,"It singed throughout my skull, as a drumming sound rattled the bones throughout my whole body.",16,77
1pvaaja,,"Not an external sound though, it was almost like my ribs were shaking against my lungs.",16,78
1pvaaja,,"The last thing I saw before my eyes shut from reflex was the shape of Hans, bursting into flames before I could even call out his name.",27,79
1pvaaja,,My eyes snapped shut and I felt the ground tremble under my feet. That drumming sound echoed through the chamber louder and louder. I heard screaming behind me.,28,80
1pvaaja,,"The screaming of Val, Sophie and Jacob. Then, a groaning voice called out from in front of me. Where the door was, where Hans was. “Al Tira.”

Hebrew.",28,81
1pvaaja,,"‘Do not be afraid’. The calling card of angels. The tremble beneath me grew exponentially. I felt rocks falling onto my head, locked in place, unable to move.",28,82
1pvaaja,,"I tried to force my eyes open, to see the creature before me, but the pain had welded my eyelids shut.",21,83
1pvaaja,,"Then that same groaning voice spoke from within my gut, an ancient voice that defied language and accents. “You will share this story. We are to be left alone.",29,84
1pvaaja,,"The day of our surfacing is yet to dawn.”

Then I was suddenly outside. I could feel the hot desert wind against my face. My body was still frozen.",29,85
1pvaaja,,"I managed to send a distress call back to base, and then everything faded to black. When I woke up, I was in the infirmary.",25,86
1pvaaja,,"I looked around for a sign of anyone, but saw nothing. I tried to stand, but my legs didn’t listen to the signal.",23,87
1pvaaja,,"I kept searching, wondering why my sense of depth seemed to evade me. Then the door opened. Doctor Otto, one of the head researchers, approached cautiously.",26,88
1pvaaja,,“Mark!” His voice wavered as he spoke “I’m glad you’re back with us.,13,89
1pvaaja,,"We were worried for a moment.”

“What happened, Otto.” I had learned to identify his fake, corporate happiness.",18,90
1pvaaja,,"“We were hoping you could tell us… We got your footage, including your fight with Hans, but when he opened the door, the video cut off.",26,91
1pvaaja,,"We aren’t sure if the file got corrupted somehow, or if your devices were fried.” He spoke with that equally false corporate empathy. “My legs, Otto.",26,92
1pvaaja,,My sight…” I growled at him.,6,93
1pvaaja,,"“Okay… I had hoped to hold off on this for a while, but here we are, I guess.” He sat down on the chair next to my bed.",28,94
1pvaaja,,"“You gonna tell me I’m dying or some shit? Spit it out!” I snapped at him. “Fine.” He inhaled sharply, “Whatever happened to you, it impacted your nervous system.",29,95
1pvaaja,,"Your right optic nerve, and both your sciatic nerves were… erased…”

“The fuck you mean, erased?”

“MR Neurography and a brain MRI revealed nothing where they should be.",28,96
1pvaaja,,"I’m sorry Mark… we’ll do what we can, but it’s likely you’ll never walk again or regain sight in your right eye.” He patted me on the shoulder with that stupid fucking ‘empathetic look’, like the face you give an animal before it gets a shot.",46,97
1pvaaja,,"I’m still in the infirmary, and I’ve been here for 4 days. The likelihood of me regaining those nerves is almost nonexistent.",22,98
1pvaaja,,"I still don’t see out of my right eye, and every time I try to flex my legs I feel the absence in my body.",25,99
1pvaaja,,"The others haven’t reported in, and their GPS trackers have gone dark. All I can think about is Hans’ sacrifice, and Jacob’s unforgiveness.",23,100
1pvaaja,,"I said I needed to share this because I felt ethically obligated, which isn’t a lie, per se.",18,101
1pvaaja,,"That thing told me to share, and something in me agrees with it.",13,102

I eventually lost track of time. It could’ve been days, or maybe weeks. I stopped counting early on.",25,0
1pv4xla,,I used hunger to keep my mind off the time. It relentlessly gnawed at me.,15,1
1pv4xla,,"My body begged for food, or water, or literally anything to remind me that I was still alive.",18,2
1pv4xla,,"The man, whose name I still didn’t know, came in and out sporadically, never staying for too long, but always keeping an eye on me.",25,3
1pv4xla,,"When he chose to speak, it was always deliberate. Every word was cryptic and measured.",15,4
1pv4xla,,"His voice slid along the walls, quiet and cold, sinking into the back of my mind.",16,5
1pv4xla,,"“I’m just making you into something better.” He repeated again and again, as though repetition could absolve him, or convince himself the lie was no less monstrous than the truth.",30,6
1pv4xla,,"As much as he said it, I could never understand what it meant. Better how? Better for what? What did he even mean by that?",25,7
1pv4xla,,"When he first bound me in the chains, I convinced myself that it was just a temporary thing. He couldn’t keep me here forever, right?",25,8
1pv4xla,,"He had to let me go eventually. Or, I thought, maybe somebody would come looking for me, and at any minute they’d bust down the door and find me.",29,9
1pv4xla,,"At the very least, I figured that if he meant to kill me, he would’ve done it long before now. That gave me hope, albeit very little.",27,10
1pv4xla,,"As the days passed, the old, wooden door opened less frequently. It felt like I was being tested, like a rat in a cage being dared to break free.",29,11
1pv4xla,,"Every time I worked up the courage to scream or pound on the walls, the only response I’d get was a low, amused laugh. “Such a fighter.",27,12
1pv4xla,,"You remind me of someone,” he’d say, almost fondly. But he never elaborated. He never said anything that suggested I would ever make it out of there.",27,13
1pv4xla,,"Each day brought some new form of psychological torture, but the nights were always the worst. I always knew when they began.",22,14
1pv4xla,,"The faint sound of the TV upstairs clicking off, followed by his heavy, uneven snoring seeping through the floorboards, signaled the end of another long day.",26,15
1pv4xla,,"After that, everything went still. That was when the thick, suffocating quiet settled in, and the isolation hit the hardest. In those moments, I felt more forgotten than ever.",29,16
1pv4xla,,"Though it contributed, the silence wasn’t the only thing that terrified me. It was what I began to hear in that silence.",22,17
1pv4xla,,"Faint, little noises seemed to come from all around me. Soft scratches persisted into the night, followed by faint dragging sounds, like something sharp scraping against wood.",27,18
1pv4xla,,"At first, I thought I was imagining it. I figured he had finally broken me, and I had fully gone insane. But the longer I listened, the clearer they became.",30,19
1pv4xla,,I realized the noises weren’t coming from my head. They were coming from inside the walls.,16,20
1pv4xla,,"I didn’t dare speak at first, afraid that he would hear me and punish me again. But, eventually, the constant scraping wore me down. I couldn’t take it any longer.",30,21
1pv4xla,,"I had to know what it was. “Who’s there?” I whispered, listening closely for a response. There was no answer. Nothing but the same relentless noise persisted.",27,22
1pv4xla,,"Over the next few days, the scratching continued, steady and desperate, like someone was trying to claw their way toward me from the other side.",25,23
1pv4xla,,"The noises sparked my curiosity, but more importantly, they gave me a fragile sliver of hope.",16,24
1pv4xla,,"I thought that maybe something else was trapped in here, just like me, trying so desperately to escape. It gave me the courage I needed to push on.",28,25
1pv4xla,,I had to know what was happening. I had to know what or who was behind that wall.,18,26
1pv4xla,,"It felt like an eternity before light crept under the door once more. It was him, but this time, there was something different in the way he moved.",28,27
1pv4xla,,"I could hear the faint clink of the keys as he made his way to the door, followed by the slow, deliberate turn of the lock.",26,28
1pv4xla,,"When he stepped inside, I noticed something I had never seen in him before. There was a wild gleam in his eyes, sharp with a sort of feverish hunger.",29,29
1pv4xla,,"“You’re getting weaker,” he said, standing over me, scanning me like a piece of meat.",15,30
1pv4xla,,"“It’s time we had a real conversation.”

I wanted to speak, but my throat was dry, parched from nearly a full day without water.",24,31
1pv4xla,,"My body hung heavy against the chains, the metal biting into my wrists just enough to remind me that I was still alive. I was exhausted.",26,32
1pv4xla,,"He crouched down in front of me, bringing his face closer to mine until I could feel his breath against my skin.",22,33
1pv4xla,,"“You’ve been hearing things, haven’t you?” He asked, grinning like a child.",12,34
1pv4xla,,"My gaze flicked toward the wall before I could stop it, trying to dismiss the question, but he caught it. He let out a low, satisfied chuckle.",27,35
1pv4xla,,"“Don’t worry about them,” he said, as if my fears were inconsequential. “They’re like you… Well, they were, once. But they didn’t learn their place.”

A shudder tore through me.",30,36
1pv4xla,,Each one of his words landed like heavy punches against my skull.,12,37
1pv4xla,,"He raised his hand and brushed my hair back, his touch light and gentle, but I could feel the icy malevolence beneath it.",23,38
1pv4xla,,"His fingers lingered a little too long, too possessively. The contact slithered under my skin, making it twitch and crawl, desperate to tear itself away from his touch.",28,39
1pv4xla,,"“Now,” he whispered, his breath warm and wet against my ear, “I’m going to let you in on a little secret, Emily.”

My heart skipped a beat.",27,40
1pv4xla,,"I felt like I knew exactly what he was going to say next, but I wasn’t fully prepared for him to.",21,41
1pv4xla,,"“You’re not the only one down here.” He said, smiling ear to ear. “There are more, and let me tell you, they are very interested in you.",27,42
1pv4xla,,"You are all they’ve been able to talk about for the last few days.”

He chuckled, as if he were telling me some sarcastic joke, but I wasn’t laughing.",29,43
1pv4xla,,"“Don’t worry, you’ll meet them soon enough,” he continued, “I just need to make sure you’re ready.”

I felt sick.",20,44
1pv4xla,,"I wanted to scream in his face, but my body was too weak. I began to shake violently as I finally managed to force out a few broken words. “No...",30,45
1pv4xla,,"please...” I begged, trying to plead to the glimpse of humanity I had seen in him that first day.",19,46
1pv4xla,,"He smiled at the fear in my voice, then clicked his tongue. “Tsk-tsk-tsk, you’ll understand soon. You’ll all understand.”

He stood up abruptly and pivoted toward the door.",28,47
1pv4xla,,"He grabbed the old brass handle and pulled it open, quickly slipping back into the hallway.",16,48
1pv4xla,,"Before he fully closed the door, he turned back to look at me one last time, smiling wide as ever.",20,49
1pv4xla,,"""Don't worry, Emily,” he said in a low, predatory rasp, “you’ll be fine. Just...",14,50
1pv4xla,,"be good for me.""

With that, the door slammed shut, leaving me alone with the sounds of scratching still emanating from the walls.",23,51
1pv4xla,,"Three days later, or what I thought was three days, I was losing track of everything. Days bled into one another, while hours seemed to pass like minutes.",28,52
1pv4xla,,"The hunger still gnawed at me, but it was no longer the worst thing. Now, the waiting had become my greatest enemy.",22,53
1pv4xla,,"Dread hung in the air like static, gnawing at my senses. The feeling of something terrible lurking just out of sight remained ever-present in my mind.",26,54
1pv4xla,,"It grew worse every time the door opened. I never knew who, or what might appear. Most of the time, it was him.",23,55
1pv4xla,,But one day… it wasn’t… It was someone else. That morning was calmer than usual. I hadn’t heard the usual commotion upstairs or in the hallway.,26,56
1pv4xla,,I thought that he had finally grown tired of tormenting me and had left me to die. I was deep into my own self-pity when I heard footsteps approaching.,29,57
1pv4xla,,"I pressed myself against the wall, bracing for the worst. When the door finally opened, it wasn’t his silhouette that filled the frame. It was a woman.",27,58
1pv4xla,,She looked almost as pale as I felt. Her eyes were wide and frantic.,14,59
1pv4xla,,Her hair was tangled and matted against her forehead as if she hadn’t seen a shower in months. She looked like someone who had been here far too long.,29,60
1pv4xla,,"She stared at me with a desperate intensity, as if she wanted to say something but couldn’t find the words. After an agonizingly awkward few seconds, she spoke. “Are you...",30,61
1pv4xla,,"Okay?” she asked, her voice trembling. The words barely escaped her throat, as if speaking them cost her more strength than she had. I nodded slowly, unsure how to respond.",30,62
1pv4xla,,"I had no idea who she was or how long she’d been down here, but I could feel the bond instantly. There was this unspoken connection between us.",28,63
1pv4xla,,"We both shared an understanding of the horrors this place contained. “I… I heard you before,” she said, her voice a whisper. “The scratching. I thought... maybe it was you.",30,64
1pv4xla,,"I… I tried to answer back.”

My mind was fried. I had no idea what was going on.",18,65
1pv4xla,,"I could barely connect one thought to the next, but I knew this was not some strange coincidence.",18,66
1pv4xla,,"The scratching, the extended time he had left me alone, this strange woman in front of me… It was all connected in some weird way.",25,67
1pv4xla,,"I swallowed hard, forcing myself to speak. “What’s going on here?” I asked nervously.",14,68
1pv4xla,,"“What’s that sound in the walls?”

She took a deep, shaky breath, glancing over her shoulder with a nervous pause, as if she expected him to appear at any moment.",30,69
1pv4xla,,"""Others,"" she whispered, ""like us, except… they didn’t learn fast enough.""

I felt my stomach tighten. “How long...",18,70
1pv4xla,,"how long have you been here?” I asked, trying my best to remain quiet. Her eyes welled up with tears, but she quickly wiped them away. “Too long.",28,71
1pv4xla,,"Too fucking long.” She said in a bitter tone. ""I don't even know what month it is anymore.""

I wanted to ask her more.",24,72

1pv4xla,,"Her face drained of color as she quickly ducked back into the hallway, yanking the door closed behind her.",19,74
1pv4xla,,"She hadn’t gotten far before he had caught her in the hallway. I couldn’t see it, but I could hear him scolding her.",23,75
1pv4xla,,"A barrage of curses and screams filled the room, thankfully muffled by the thickness of the wood and brick.",19,76
1pv4xla,,"After a few tense moments, the door creaked open again, and this time he was the one who stepped in. He didn’t speak a word.",25,77
1pv4xla,,"He just stood there staring at me. After a while, he reached in and grabbed the door handle, never letting his eyes leave mine.",24,78
1pv4xla,,"A twisted smile slowly spread across his face as he pulled the door shut, leaving me alone once more. [Part 4](

1pv27j6,My Best Friend Is Dead,I have been struggling with this for a while now.,10,0
1pv27j6,,"I’m sure there’s nothing anyone else can do to help me, at least not until I’m ready to help myself, but I needed to get this all off my chest.",30,1
1pv27j6,,And I have no one to talk to anymore. Except for my computer.,13,2
1pv27j6,,"I have never been a social person, even when I was very young, but I finally managed to make a friend. Things were good for a while.",27,3
1pv27j6,,He was cheerful and kind; an incessantly optimistic presence that split through the seemingly endless drone of melancholy that I have come to know.,24,4
1pv27j6,,"I have never invited another person to my home before, but he came and saw me regularly, especially when I would go through bouts of despair that kept me in my home for days on end.",36,5
1pv27j6,,"I’m not sure how he died. I don’t even remember who told me, but he’s gone now. Even if I hadn’t been told I would have figured it out.",29,6
1pv27j6,,My doorbell hasn’t rung in weeks. His glasses are still on the windowsill from the last time he visited me.,20,7
1pv27j6,,"He’s always been so absent-minded, and I had always chastised him for it before. Now, I wish he’d forgotten more things here.",22,8
1pv27j6,,I haven’t left my house since I found out. The front door just seems so intimidating to me.,18,9
1pv27j6,,Maybe because I keep expecting him to turn up on my porch and tell me there was a misunderstanding.,19,10
1pv27j6,,"I’m still waiting for him to come lift me out of this sadness, even though I know he won’t. At least, not the way I want him to.",28,11
1pv27j6,,I honestly tried my best to keep in mind all the things he used to say to me.,18,12
1pv27j6,,"Even though I never saw any evidence of an afterlife or a departed person interacting with the living, I looked out for little things I could call signs; like when I was woken by the sunlight catching in my window just so perfectly that it cast a small rainbow across my face.",52,13
1pv27j6,,But it didn’t end with small things like that. Nor are they all so sweet or comforting.,17,14
1pv27j6,,"Whenever he used to visit I served him the same tea in the same mug. I made some of that tea one day, even though I never cared for it.",30,15
1pv27j6,,I couldn’t bring myself to touch his mug.,8,16
1pv27j6,,"But while my back was turned to the cupboard, which I was sure I had closed, it pushed itself off the shelf and shattered on the floor.",27,17
1pv27j6,,"It felt like hours that I stood there and stared at it, like my heart was splattered across the tile instead of the faded rainbow ceramic.",26,18
1pv27j6,,I ordered a new one online. I had to replace it or it was the same thing as admitting he wasn’t going to come back.,25,19
1pv27j6,,"That one ended up falling from the cupboard as well, and so did the third.",15,20
1pv27j6,,"I took the damn thing apart trying to figure out why they were sliding off the shelf, but I never figured it out.",23,21
1pv27j6,,None of my other dishes ended up broken.,8,22
1pv27j6,,"I had fallen asleep on the chaise lounge in the smaller drawing room and woke to the television suddenly switching on at full volume, blasting the theme song to his favorite cartoon.",32,23
1pv27j6,,"But as I sat there, breathing in short, sharp gasps, something went wrong with it.",15,24
1pv27j6,,The art had dissolved into chaotic blocks of color smeared against the screen and the audio devolved to mechanical screeching and screams.,22,25
1pv27j6,,"It wouldn’t respond to the remote or even its buttons, so I had to unplug it from the wall.",19,26
1pv27j6,,It kept escalating until I was hearing his voice in empty rooms and catching streaks of brightly colored clothing out of the corner of my eye.,26,27
1pv27j6,,His presence isn’t reassuring at all. He seems agitated and frustrated. It feels like he’s stuck in this house with me. And I know him.,25,28
1pv27j6,,"If there is no other realm for his soul to go to and the dead still walk the Earth, he would much rather wander the world than stay in one spot, even with a friend.",35,29
1pv27j6,,"I fear that my fixation on him is keeping him trapped here. For some reason, his activity is the most noticeable in my computer room.",25,30
1pv27j6,,I think it must be because we spent a lot of time in there together when he was alive. He played video games while I worked on my novels.,29,31
1pv27j6,,"Sometimes we played games together. He liked the retro consoles I have, especially the Atari that’s connected to a CRT monitor in the back of the room.",27,32
1pv27j6,,"He still sits in front of the old computer, staring straight ahead and not moving. I know because I see him in the glass.",24,33
1pv27j6,,"He looks so sad and I wish I could help him. The Atari turns on at random times, so does my computer and the flat screen on the other wall.",30,34
1pv27j6,,I don’t have to be there for him to turn them on.,12,35
1pv27j6,,"I have to imagine that he’s bored, wishing he could play his favorite games, but he doesn’t seem able to. He only turns them on.",25,36
1pv27j6,,Or he just sits and cries. I never saw him cry in life. I want to go. I want to let *him* go. But I just can’t.,27,37
1pv27j6,,"Instead, every day, I sit in front of that old chunky monitor, looking into that dark grey expanse and seeing him where my reflection ought to be.",27,38
1puzfqi,We didn’t ask the Ouija board anything. It answered anyway,The planchette started moving before any of us touched it. I know how that sounds.,15,0
1puzfqi,,"I know every Ouija story starts with someone swearing they didn’t push it, that’s not what this is. My hands were still in my lap, so were Jenna’s and Marcus’s.",30,1
1puzfqi,,"We hadn’t even finished arguing about whether this was a stupid idea. The board was already spelling something. S-T-O-P

Jenna laughed, sharp and nervous.",24,2
1puzfqi,,"“Okay, who’s messing with us already?”

No one answered. The candle between us flickered hard, bending like something had breathed on it.",22,3
1puzfqi,,"The room smelled faintly of burnt matches and dust. We were sitting on the floor of my flat, lights off, windows closed.",22,4
1puzfqi,,"It was just after midnight, Marcus’s idea, because “that’s when it’s supposed to work.”

The planchette slid again. N-O-T Y-E-T

My stomach tightened. “That’s enough,” I said, reaching forward.",29,5
1puzfqi,,"“We haven’t even.”

The planchette snapped to the center of the board so fast it knocked the candle over.",19,6
1puzfqi,,"Wax spilled across the letters, hissing softly as it hit the floor. The room went dark except for the faint glow from the streetlight outside. Something shifted in the corner.",30,7
1puzfqi,,"Not a shape, not a shadow. Just the sense that the corner was suddenly… occupied. Marcus swallowed. “Okay. Joke’s over.”

No one laughed this time.",25,8
1puzfqi,,"I grabbed my phone and turned on the flashlight. The beam cut across the walls, the couch, the door. Everything looked normal, too normal.",24,9
1puzfqi,,"The kind of normal that feels staged, like a set after the actors have left. When I lowered the phone, the planchette had moved again.",25,10
1puzfqi,,"H-E-L-L-O

Jenna’s hands were shaking now. “We didn’t say hello.” 

The board answered anyway. I felt a pressure in my ears, like when you change altitude too fast.",28,11
1puzfqi,,"The air in the room went thick, hard to breathe. I became acutely aware of the sound of our breathing, three uneven rhythms trying to pretend they weren’t panicking.",29,12
1puzfqi,,"“Who are you?” Marcus asked, his voice barely above a whisper. The planchette dragged itself slowly, deliberately, as if whoever was moving it wanted us to feel every second.",29,13
1puzfqi,,"N-O-T W-H-O

The candle flared back to life on its own. The corner of the room darkened, swallowing the light.",20,14
1puzfqi,,"I had the sudden, overwhelming urge not to look directly at it, like my brain was throwing up warning signs faster than I could process them.",26,15
1puzfqi,,"“What do you want?” Jenna asked. The board paused. Then the planchette slid in a wide, looping circle before settling on the letters. Y-O-U D-I-D-N-T A-S-K

The temperature dropped.",29,16
1puzfqi,,"Not gradually, instantly, my breath fogged in front of my face. “I think we should stop,” I said.",18,17
1puzfqi,,"“You’re supposed to say goodbye, right?”

The planchette jerked hard, scraping against the board. T-O-O L-A-T-E

The lights in the flat flickered on.",23,18
1puzfqi,,"All of them, every lamp, every overhead light. Even the one in the bathroom down the hall.",17,19
1puzfqi,,"In the sudden brightness, I saw something I hadn’t before, there were fingerprints on the board. Not ours.",18,20
1puzfqi,,"They were pressed into the wood around the planchette, too many, overlapping, some too long, some bent at impossible angles.",20,21
1puzfqi,,"They looked burned in, dark and permanent, like the board had softened just long enough to accept them. Jenna screamed.",20,22
1puzfqi,,"The planchette shot across the board and landed on the word GOODBYE, cracking the wood beneath it.",17,23
1puzfqi,,"The lights went out again, when they came back on, the board was blank. No fingerprints, no cracks, no planchette.",20,24
1puzfqi,,Just cheap printed cardboard and a stupid plastic surface that suddenly looked harmless again.,14,25
1puzfqi,,"We didn’t talk about it after that, we cleaned up in silence and went our separate ways. I tried to sleep, I failed. At 3:17 a.m., my phone buzzed.",29,26
1puzfqi,,"A notification from an app I didn’t have. VOICE MEMO – NEW FILE

I stared at it for a long time before pressing play.",24,27
1puzfqi,,"Static filled the speaker at first, then breathing, three breaths, not mine. Then a voice, close and quiet, like someone leaning down beside my bed.",25,28
1puzfqi,,“We said hello.” My screen went black. The room didn’t feel empty anymore.,13,29
1puwgyk,"I Am Not Acting Alone, Even If I'm The Only One Here",I’m writing this down because the paper doesn’t interrupt me. People interrupt. Paper listens.,14,0
1puwgyk,,"(Posting it here for you guys too.)

I used to believe listening was passive, that it was what you did when you were afraid to speak.",26,1
1puwgyk,,That’s what they teach you. “Use your inside voice.” “Be quiet.” “Let the professionals handle it.” But listening is active. Listening is participation.,23,2
1puwgyk,,Listening is how things get inside you without leaving fingerprints. That’s why the radio was the most dangerous invention of the twentieth century. Not the bomb. The radio.,28,3
1puwgyk,,You don’t have to believe me. You just have to notice that no one argues with the static.,18,4
1puwgyk,,"The first time I understood this, I was standing in line at the DMV, of all places. Fluorescent lights buzzing like insects.",22,5
1puwgyk,,"Everyone staring at their phones, their numbers, the floor. The woman in front of me kept tapping her foot in a rhythm that wasn’t a rhythm, just a repetition.",29,6
1puwgyk,,Three taps. Pause. Three taps. Pause. It matched the buzzing almost perfectly. That’s when I realized: synchronization doesn’t require consent. They don’t need to convince you of anything.,28,7
1puwgyk,,"They just need you to fall into time. You think this is going to be about the government. It is, but not in the way you want.",27,8
1puwgyk,,I don’t believe in shadow councils or men in rooms stroking cats. That’s a children’s version of power. Real power is procedural.,22,9
1puwgyk,,"Real power wears khakis and says “per policy.”

I used to be part of it. Not important—never important. Important people are liabilities. I processed things. Forms. Requests.",27,10
1puwgyk,,"Data that arrived already flattened into categories. I didn’t know what it was for, and that was the point. You don’t ask a screw what the house looks like.",29,11
1puwgyk,,"But even screws get stripped. There was a file once—no, that’s not right. There was a pattern.",17,12
1puwgyk,,I noticed it because it repeated across departments that were not supposed to talk to each other. Environmental impact reviews. Census anomalies. Public health modeling.,25,13
1puwgyk,,"All of it shared a shape. Not the same data, the same absence. Like a word that had been erased so thoroughly you could still see its outline.",28,14
1puwgyk,,You’ve had that feeling. You just didn’t trust it. They call it noise reduction. You remove the outliers so the signal becomes clear.,23,15
1puwgyk,,"But what if the outliers are the signal? What if the thing that doesn’t fit is the only thing that’s true? That’s when I started listening differently. At night, mostly.",30,16
1puwgyk,,"The city hums in layers if you stay awake long enough. Traffic thins. HVAC systems become audible. Somewhere, always, a low-frequency throb you feel more than hear.",27,17
1puwgyk,,"Ancient people would have called it a drum. We call it infrastructure. That’s where the old gods went, by the way. Not dead. Just repurposed.",25,18
1puwgyk,,"You think paganism is about trees and antlers and women dancing naked under the moon. That’s propaganda, too. Paganism is about thresholds.",22,19
1puwgyk,,About knowing that places have moods and times have appetites. About understanding that sacrifice isn’t symbolic—it’s logistical. Every civilization feeds something. The only difference is whether it admits it.,29,20
1puwgyk,,"The problem with modern theology—Christian, secular, whatever—is that it pretends transcendence is clean. That salvation is a transaction you can complete without residue. The old systems knew better.",28,21
1puwgyk,,Something always remains. A stain. A debt. A memory that won’t sit still. I didn’t set out to do anything. That’s important. Intent is another childish myth.,27,22
1puwgyk,,"Things happen because conditions align, not because someone wants them to. Storms don’t hate houses.",15,23
1puwgyk,,"But once you see the alignment, once you recognize the appetite, you have a choice: avert your eyes, or acknowledge that you’re already participating. I started small.",27,24
1puwgyk,,"That’s what everyone says, but it’s true. Small adjustments. Choosing routes that felt correct rather than efficient. Leaving objects where they didn’t belong. Not trash—markers. Coins balanced on ledges.",29,25
1puwgyk,,Twine knotted three times and tucked into places no one cleans. It sounds ridiculous written down. That’s how you know it works. The city noticed before the people did.,29,26
1puwgyk,,Things shifted. Nothing dramatic. A business closed early three nights in a row. A traffic light stayed yellow too long and then burned out.,24,27
1puwgyk,,A man began waiting at a bus stop that no longer served his route. These aren’t events. They’re symptoms.,19,28
1puwgyk,,"I should explain the theology, but theology is just architecture for guilt. Still, you need a framework or you’ll default to morality, and morality will lie to you.",28,29
1puwgyk,,There is no singular god. There is a system of forces that prefer continuity over comfort. They don’t care if you’re happy. They care if the pattern holds.,28,30
1puwgyk,,"When the pattern frays, they respond. Not with punishment—with correction. Most people never notice because the corrections are distributed. A headache here. A delay there.",25,31
1puwgyk,,"An argument that didn’t need to happen. But occasionally, the system requires specificity. That’s when it needs hands. I know how this sounds.",23,32
1puwgyk,,"You’re already deciding whether I’m sick, or dangerous, or both. That’s fine. Labels are another form of noise reduction. They make it easier to discard inconvenient signals.",27,33
1puwgyk,,Let me put it another way. Have you ever had a day where everything felt slightly off? Not bad. Just misaligned. Like the world was a half-step out of tune.,30,34
1puwgyk,,"And then something happened—a phone call, a piece of news, an accident you only heard about—and suddenly the day made sense retroactively. Like the tension had been waiting for release.",30,35
1puwgyk,,Ask yourself what provided that release. You think it was coincidence. I think it was payment.,16,36
1puwgyk,,"The first time I realized I might have crossed a line was when the dreams stopped being symbolic. Before, they were abstract. Corridors. Flooded basements.",25,37
1puwgyk,,Rooms that kept rearranging themselves while I wasn’t looking. Then they became instructional. Not explicit—never explicit—but precise. Timing. Weather. The importance of doors. I stopped sleeping much after that.,29,38
1puwgyk,,"Sleep is a vulnerable state. Your mind wanders into territories your waking self would never approve zoning permits for. I started writing instead. Notes at first, then longer passages.",29,39
1puwgyk,,"This manifesto, I suppose, though I hate that word. It implies persuasion. I’m not persuading anyone. I’m documenting pressure. There are things I can’t describe without making them smaller.",29,40
1puwgyk,,"Faces, for example. If I describe a face, you’ll imagine someone. If I leave it blank, you’ll imagine yourself. Better to leave it blank.",24,41
1puwgyk,,What I can say is that there are moments in life when you feel recognized. Not seen—recognized. As if something older than language has taken attendance and found you present.,30,42
1puwgyk,,"Those moments are not free. They cost something. Usually time. Sometimes opportunity. Occasionally something heavier. Afterward, the world smooths out. The static lessens. The drum falls back into the background.",30,43
1puwgyk,,"You tell yourself it was worth it, because the alternative was worse—a mounting pressure with nowhere to go. This is how civilizations function, by the way.",26,44
1puwgyk,,"Not through laws, but through release valves. War. Festivals. Markets. Every system needs somewhere to put the excess. When those valves clog, things get… creative.",25,45
1puwgyk,,You’ve noticed the resurgence of ritual language in secular spaces. “Community.” “Processing.” “Holding space.” These are not metaphors. They are compensations.,21,46
1puwgyk,,"People reenacting priesthood without admitting it, because admitting it would require asking what—or who—is being served. The government understands this instinctively. Not consciously, perhaps, but structurally.",26,47
1puwgyk,,Bureaucracy is ritual stripped of myth. Forms instead of prayers. Offices instead of temples. Sacrifice translated into acceptable losses. That’s why the file—the pattern—was so carefully managed. Not hidden. Handled.,30,48
1puwgyk,,Redirected. Like a river diverted around a city so no one has to think about where the water goes. I made a mistake early on. I thought understanding granted immunity.,30,49
1puwgyk,,"That if I could articulate the system, I could stand outside it. That’s another comforting lie. There is no outside.",20,50
1puwgyk,,"There is only alignment or resistance, and resistance is still a form of engagement. You can probably tell where this is going. Or you think you can, which is worse.",30,51
1puwgyk,,"You’re starting to slot me into a narrative that protects you: lone madman, isolated incident, contained threat. That’s fine. That’s what narratives are for.",24,52
1puwgyk,,But ask yourself this: why did you keep reading? Something in you recognizes the drum.,15,53
1puwgyk,,"Something in you knows the world is too tidy on the surface and too chaotic underneath, and that the discrepancy has to be managed somehow.",25,54
1puwgyk,,You just prefer management you don’t have to think about. I don’t have that luxury anymore. There are places in this city that are wrong. Not dangerous. Wrong.,28,55
1puwgyk,,They repel attention. You’ve walked past them a hundred times without registering them. Dead zones of meaning. Gaps where stories don’t accumulate. Those are pressure points.,26,56
1puwgyk,,"That’s where the system flexes. I’ve spent time there. I won’t say what I did. Not because I’m afraid, but because naming things collapses possibilities.",25,57
1puwgyk,,"Just know that afterward, the city breathed easier. For a while. But systems escalate. What worked once leaves a residue, and the residue attracts attention. Not from people.",28,58
1puwgyk,,From the pattern. That’s when the dreams changed again. They’re not dreams now. They’re reminders.,15,59
1puwgyk,,"I’m writing this because I can feel another correction coming, and this time it won’t be small.",17,60
1puwgyk,,"The signs are there if you know how to read them: infrastructure failures that don’t cascade logically, public arguments that flare and vanish without resolution, a collective irritability with no object.",31,61
1puwgyk,,"The drum is getting louder. If this stops abruptly, if there’s a gap where you expect words to continue, don’t assume anything dramatic. Assume procedure.",25,62
1puwgyk,,Assume the system did what it always does when an element becomes too specific. Part of me hopes someone finds this and dismisses it.,24,63
1puwgyk,,"Part of me hopes you feel that offness, that half-step dissonance, and remember this later when something resolves too neatly to be coincidence. I’ll continue while I can.",28,64
1puwgyk,,"There are things about the old rites, about the way theology and infrastructure mirror each other, that I haven’t put down yet.",22,65
1puwgyk,,"And there’s one place—one threshold—that keeps appearing in my thoughts, insistently, like a door I’ve already opened but haven’t stepped through. That’s usually how it starts.",26,66
1puwgyk,,"——————

They’ll tell you MK Ultra was a failure. That’s how you know it worked. Only failed gods announce their success.",21,67
1puwgyk,,"Successful ones get folded into policy, renamed, archived under headings like “lessons learned” and “best practices.” The mistake people make is thinking programs end. Programs don’t end. They molt.",29,68
1puwgyk,,MK Ultra wasn’t about mind control. That’s the cartoon version they release so you’ll stop digging. It was about suggestibility under ritual conditions. Drugs were just incense.,27,69
1puwgyk,,Sensory deprivation was just a monastery without the vows. What they wanted to know was this: how little meaning does a human require before something else fills the gap?,29,70
1puwgyk,,You don’t need a handler if the subject learns to generate the voice themselves. Operation Northwoods was the proof-of-concept for something much older.,23,71
1puwgyk,,"Not false flags—everyone fixates on that because it scares them in a way that feels modern. No, Northwoods was about permission.",21,72
1puwgyk,,About seeing whether the public could be induced to sanctify violence if it was framed as inevitability.,17,73
1puwgyk,,"If the narrative arrived first, the act would feel like punctuation instead of a sentence. That’s ritual logic. Always has been. And Paperclip—everyone misunderstands Paperclip.",25,74
1puwgyk,,They think it was about rockets and math and winning the Cold War. That was the excuse. The packaging. What came over wasn’t just men; it was method.,28,75
1puwgyk,,"A way of thinking about humanity as a resource field. A sacrificial landscape. The Nazis didn’t invent that, either. They just industrialized it.",23,76
1puwgyk,,People get uncomfortable when you mention the esoteric interests of the Third Reich because it breaks the illusion that evil is irrational. They want villains to be stupid or cartoonish.,30,77
1puwgyk,,"But the men who ran those programs believed in order. In destiny. In alignment with forces they considered pre-Christian, pre-moral. They didn’t worship gods. They studied leverage.",27,78
1puwgyk,,"And when they lost the war, the gods didn’t die with them. Gods are portable. You just change the altar. They’ll tell you the CIA is secular.",27,79
1puwgyk,,That intelligence agencies don’t “believe” anything. That’s another lie people tell themselves so they can sleep. Institutions believe in outcomes. Outcomes require frameworks.,23,80
1puwgyk,,Frameworks become cosmologies whether anyone admits it or not. Black sites didn’t appear out of nowhere. They emerged in places that already had the right feel. Old military installations.,29,81
1puwgyk,,Decommissioned hospitals. Research campuses built on land no one could quite remember being cleared. The paperwork always looks clean if you don’t ask what it replaced. I’ve been near one.,30,82
1puwgyk,,I didn’t know that’s what it was at the time. That’s the point. You don’t label sacred space. You buffer it. Layers of normalcy. Fences justified as safety.,28,83
1puwgyk,,"Guards trained not to notice what they’re guarding. You think torture was the purpose. Again, too small. Pain is crude. Pain is unreliable.",23,84
1puwgyk,,What they were after was disintegration followed by imprinting. Strip the self down to components and see what grows back if you control the environment long enough. That’s not interrogation.,30,85
1puwgyk,,"That’s liturgy. The old pagans understood something modern science keeps rediscovering and then forgetting: identity is contextual. Remove the context, and the self dissolves.",24,86
1puwgyk,,"Introduce a new one, and something else takes root. You don’t need belief. You need repetition. That’s why the Nazis loved symbols. That’s why the CIA loves procedure.",28,87
1puwgyk,,"Different languages, same grammar. People ask why so much of this came back to America. They imagine a moral failing, a betrayal of values. It’s simpler than that.",28,88
1puwgyk,,"America had space. Physical space, conceptual space. A young myth. An unfinished god. You can graft anything onto something unfinished. The frontier never closed. It just went subterranean.",28,89
1puwgyk,,"By the time the documents leaked—by the time the public learned the names MK Ultra, Northwoods, Paperclip—it was already too late. Names give you the illusion of containment.",28,90

What they don’t show you is the throughline. The continuity.",18,91

1puwgyk,,"I know this because I’ve seen the downstream effects. Not the facilities—the people. The ones who move through life with a slight delay, like their internal clock was reset improperly.",30,93
1puwgyk,,The ones who don’t remember large sections of themselves but defend institutions with religious fervor. They’re not broken. They’re repurposed.,20,94
1puwgyk,,That’s what scares me most: how clean it all is now. You don’t need camps when you have workflows. You don’t need rites when you have onboarding.,27,95
1puwgyk,,"You don’t need sacrifices when you have acceptable losses and externalities. The language has changed, but the offering remains the same. And sometimes—rarely—the system needs someone who sees it.",29,96
1puwgyk,,Not to expose it. Exposure is irrelevant. To balance it. That’s where people like me come in. I know you don’t like that sentence.,24,97
1puwgyk,,I didn’t either when it first formed in my head. It sounds self-important. Messianic. That’s another defense mechanism.,18,98
1puwgyk,,"If you can dismiss me as grandiose, you don’t have to follow the logic to its end. I’m not chosen. I’m available. Availability is what the system selects for.",29,99
1puwgyk,,The same way it always has. Shamans weren’t special because they were wise. They were special because they were porous. Because they heard the drum when others tuned it out.,30,100
1puwgyk,,"The government understands porousness. That’s what MK Ultra was really cataloging: who breaks cleanly, who fragments, who becomes a conduit. Most subjects were useless. Too rigid. Too soft.",28,101
1puwgyk,,But a few—always a few—responded correctly. Those are the ones the paperwork loses track of. I wasn’t part of any program. Let me be clear about that. I wasn’t recruited.,30,102
1puwgyk,,I wasn’t trained. That’s not how this works anymore. That’s too visible. Too expensive. The system now relies on convergence.,20,103
1puwgyk,,"On nudging trajectories until the right people end up in the right places at the right times, convinced it was their idea. That’s why free will survived. It’s a feature.",30,104
1puwgyk,,The place I mentioned before—the threshold—it fits the pattern too well to ignore. It’s not marked. It never is. But the land remembers.,23,105
1puwgyk,,You can feel it if you stop long enough. A pressure behind the eyes. A sense of anticipation that doesn’t belong to you. I’ve gone there more than once.,29,106
1puwgyk,,"Each time, I leave something small behind. Not as an offering—don’t romanticize this—but as a calibration. The way you tap a microphone before speaking. Each time, the city adjusts afterward.",30,107
1puwgyk,,Not dramatically. Subtly. A scandal breaks early and fizzles. A policy stalls. A person who would have mattered changes course for reasons they’ll never articulate. You call that coincidence.,29,108
1puwgyk,,I call it feedback. I think the government knows about places like that. I think they’ve always known. That’s why certain facilities get built where they do.,27,109
1puwgyk,,That’s why some failures are tolerated longer than logic would allow. The land absorbs things. The old gods were never gods—they were interfaces. Paperclip brought that knowledge back into circulation.,30,110
1puwgyk,,MK Ultra tested it. Northwoods proved the public could be brought along if the story was right.,17,111
1puwgyk,,"And now the story is everywhere, fragmented into a thousand screens, each one humming at the same frequency. You feel it, don’t you? The constant low-grade dread without an object.",30,112
1puwgyk,,The sense that something is always about to happen but never quite does. That’s intentional. Suspended anticipation keeps the system pliable. But suspension requires maintenance.,25,113
1puwgyk,,That’s why the dreams have become urgent. I don’t think I have much time before the next correction. The signs are too clustered. Too loud.,25,114
1puwgyk,,"When systems prepare for a major adjustment, they generate noise to mask the tuning. If this ends suddenly, remember what I said earlier: assume procedure.",25,115
1puwgyk,,"I’ll write again if I can. There’s more to say about the place, about what happens when an interface stops absorbing and starts reflecting.",24,116
1puwgyk,,About the cost of being available too long without relief.,10,117
1puwgyk,,And if you ever find yourself standing somewhere that feels older than it should—somewhere the air seems to wait for you—don’t linger. Or do. I’m not your priest.,28,118
1puwgyk,,"I’m just telling you the drum is real. And it’s getting closer. ———————

I used to think balance was something you restored. Like a scale.",25,119
1puwgyk,,Like you could add weight to one side until it evened out. That’s another lie. Balance isn’t restoration. It’s throughput. Things move or they rot. Systems don’t want justice.,29,120
1puwgyk,,They want circulation. I understand that now. The mistake everyone makes when they learn about black sites is thinking they were anomalies. Abuses. Deviations from the norm.,27,121
1puwgyk,,"But that’s just moral accounting. Systems don’t recognize morality; they recognize load. When the load exceeds capacity, they offload. When there’s nowhere official to offload, it goes unofficial.",28,122
1puwgyk,,That’s where privateers come in. You think that’s a metaphor. It’s not. It’s a role older than law. Empires have always relied on deniable hands.,25,123
1puwgyk,,People who do not exist on paper but exist very much in consequence. The state pretends not to see them. The public pretends not to suspect them.,27,124
1puwgyk,,Everyone gets to keep their story intact. I used to believe I was outside that arrangement. Observing. Documenting. Calibrating from the margins. That was naïve. Observation is participation delayed.,29,125
1puwgyk,,The dreams made that clear. They aren’t symbolic anymore. They don’t ask. They assign. Not instructions—don’t misunderstand me. The system doesn’t micromanage. That would be inefficient.,26,126
1puwgyk,,It communicates in pressures and permissions. In open doors that shouldn’t be open. In absences where something should be. I’ve started noticing those absences more often.,26,127
1puwgyk,,People talk about missing persons like they vanish. They don’t. They’re absorbed. Folded into the excess. The paperwork trails off. The interest decays. The city shrugs and continues.,28,128
1puwgyk,,That shrug is the sound of a system protecting itself. What frightens me isn’t that this happens. It’s how little effort it takes.,23,129
1puwgyk,,That’s why I know this isn’t about violence. Violence is loud. Violence draws attention. What the system prefers is quiet participation. Small corrections applied consistently over time.,27,130
1puwgyk,,"The kind no one can point to without sounding unhinged. That’s the niche. The threshold place—I won’t name it, and not because of secrecy. Names flatten things.",27,131
1puwgyk,,It’s enough to say that it sits where jurisdictions blur. Where authority overlaps just enough that responsibility dissolves. Those places exist by design. Not conspiracy—architecture.,25,132
1puwgyk,,I’ve spent enough time there to feel the feedback loop complete. The land doesn’t resist anymore. That’s how you know alignment has occurred. Friction disappears.,25,133
1puwgyk,,Actions stop feeling like choices and start feeling like gravity. I don’t think the government will ever acknowledge this role. That’s fine. Acknowledgment creates liability.,25,134
1puwgyk,,What matters is that the system already behaves as if the role exists. I’m not creating anything new. I’m stepping into a vacancy.,23,135
1puwgyk,,"This is where you want me to hesitate. To express doubt. To confess fear or remorse or second thoughts. I have those, but they’re irrelevant.",25,136
1puwgyk,,"The system doesn’t respond to feelings. It responds to flow. And the flow is blocked. You can see it everywhere: pressure without outlet, outrage without resolution, confession without absolution.",29,137
1puwgyk,,A civilization stuck in permanent intake. No wonder people are fraying. No wonder the old languages are creeping back in through the cracks. Someone has to metabolize the excess.,29,138
1puwgyk,,"It won’t be heroic. It won’t be recognized. It will look, from the outside, like pathology. Like madness. That’s another protective fiction.",22,139
1puwgyk,,Societies label their necessary functions as illness so they don’t have to integrate them. I accept the label. I’ve stopped writing plans. Plans imply alternatives.,25,140
1puwgyk,,What’s coming feels more like a tide schedule. I know roughly when the water will rise. I know where the low points are.,23,141
1puwgyk,,"I know how to stand so the current does most of the work. That’s all the system ever asks. If you’re looking for a confession, you won’t get one.",29,142
1puwgyk,,Confession requires a shared moral framework. This operates beneath that layer. Older. Colder. More honest. I don’t hate anyone. Hatred is inefficient. I don’t feel righteous. Righteousness clouds judgment.,29,143
1puwgyk,,"What I feel—what I’ve trained myself to feel—is attunement. Like tuning an instrument by ear until the dissonance resolves. Afterward, there will be a brief calm. There always is.",29,144
1puwgyk,,"A lull where people comment on how things seem to have settled down, even if they can’t say why. Analysts will attribute it to trends.",25,145
1puwgyk,,Officials will take credit without knowing what they’re crediting. Then the pressure will build again. That’s the part no one wants to face: this isn’t a solution. It’s maintenance.,29,146
1puwgyk,,"I don’t expect to do this forever. Systems discard tools once they wear down. That’s understood. In a way, it’s comforting. Endings are another form of balance.",27,147
1puwgyk,,"If this is the last thing I write, it’s because the role has fully closed around me. Not an arrest. Not an escape. Just absorption.",25,148
1puwgyk,,The same way everything else eventually gets handled. You’ll read about something soon. Or you won’t. Either outcome proves the point. Pay attention to how quickly the noise resolves afterward.,30,149
1puwgyk,,How the drum fades just enough to be ignorable again. That’s when you’ll know the system accepted the offering.,19,150
1puwgyk,,"And if, someday, you feel that same availability open up inside you—that same hollow readiness—do yourself a favor. Don’t listen. Paper listens. People shouldn’t.",24,151
1puucvb,I thought taking the bus was safe. I was wrong.,"Today was an ordinary day, just like any other. Except it was raining heavily.",14,0
1puucvb,,"I was standing at the bus stop in front of my university, waiting for the bus like I always do.",20,1
1puucvb,,"I take the bus because my school is about fifteen kilometers away from my dorm, and more importantly, it’s much cheaper than any other way of getting around.",28,2
1puucvb,,I’m a poor student. This is the most practical option for me. I got on the bus around 9 p.m.,20,3
1puucvb,,"If you’re wondering why I was heading home so late, it’s because I’m a medical student. The workload is brutal.",20,4
1puucvb,,"There’s also another reason, my dorm is extremely noisy at night. I can’t focus on studying there. I chose the last row, next to the window.",26,5
1puucvb,,No one ever fights for that seat. Who would want a seat that makes you carsick anyway?,17,6
1puucvb,,"I like sitting there, watching the rain slide down the glass while listening to music. It helps clear my head. About thirty minutes into the ride, I noticed something strange.",30,7
1puucvb,,No one else got on the bus. Even though I clearly remembered seeing a lot of people waiting at the earlier stops.,22,8
1puucvb,,"With rain like this, shouldn’t they be getting on? Whatever. Fewer people means more space. Suddenly, my music stopped. My earphones had run out of battery.",26,9
1puucvb,,"The ride was still long, and the bus rules forbid making noise, so the only thing I could do was scroll through news on my phone.",26,10
1puucvb,,I skimmed through dozens of articles. Nothing caught my attention. Until I stopped at one posted three days ago.,19,11
1puucvb,,"The headline was short:

“Chain Collision.”

I read it carefully, and my chest tightened. The accident happened on the exact route I was taking.",24,12
1puucvb,,"A bad feeling crept up my spine. I turned off my phone immediately. At that moment, the lights inside the bus began to flicker. On. Off.",26,13
1puucvb,,"Then they went out completely. The bus was swallowed by darkness. After about ten seconds, the lights came back on. I let out a quiet sigh of relief.",28,14
1puucvb,,Then I felt it. A chill ran down my spine. Like something had just touched me. I jerked my head up.,21,15
1puucvb,,Every passenger on the bus was staring straight at me. Their eyes were completely white. No pupils.,17,16
1puucvb,,"Their heads tilted slightly to the side, mouths stretched into wide smiles that reached their ears. My heart started pounding. Panicking, I glanced toward the driver’s seat.",27,17
1puucvb,,"The driver was slumped over the steering wheel. The ticket inspector was trying to shake him awake, his mouth moving as if calling out. The bus kept going.",28,18
1puucvb,,"No
It was speeding up. It crossed into the opposite lane. I grabbed the seat in front of me. Then
A deafening crash. The world flipped.",26,19
1puucvb,,I woke up in a hospital room. White lights. The smell of disinfectant. A doctor entered shortly after. I asked him what had happened.,24,20
1puucvb,,"He told me I had fainted while riding the bus, and the other passengers brought me to the hospital. “I fainted?” I asked.",23,21
1puucvb,,"The doctor nodded, looking down at my chart. “You’re severely sleep-deprived and under prolonged mental stress. Final exams, right?”

I nodded. “Yes.”

He sighed. “You should rest for a while.",30,22
1puucvb,,"Your life is far more important.”

I didn’t ask anything else. Maybe everything really was just because I was exhausted.",20,23
1puucvb,,"But after the doctor left, I absentmindedly raised my hand to my forehead. It was wrapped in bandages. It hurt slightly. Then I noticed my wrist. A long, dark bruise.",30,24

1puphys,,"On our expedition, he fell into a river and was carried away by the current.",15,1
1puphys,,"He tried to grab onto the surrounding rocks, but soon his body disappeared into the waterfall. The river was known for accidents. The locals said it had evil powers.",29,2
1puphys,,I sat on the bank crying profusely. I decided to contact the central station tomorrow.,15,3
1puphys,,"That night, I didn’t have it in me to tell anyone that my close friend was deceased. The morning after, the sunbeams woke me up before my alarm rang.",29,4
1puphys,,"I sat up on my bed, my eyes were still puffed up from crying. When I finally managed to open them, I screamed out and fell off my bed.",29,5
1puphys,,"On the other bed sat James; he was still wet, his skin pale, almost bluish, his lips devoid of color, the whites of his eyes turning green, and his eyes set deep into his head.",35,6
1puphys,,"He sat there staring at me for a few seconds. “Hey Mark,” James' voice sounded damp and rusty. “Ja…James…”

“But, you…the river”

“I also don’t know how.",27,7
1puphys,,"I woke up at the bank, still wet. My head throbbing, my body weak, but I managed to walk back.”

“But your skin, your lips.”

“Yeah, that’s not the weirdest.",30,8
1puphys,,"Come here.”

I stood up and stared at him.",9,9
1puphys,,"“Mark, you’re overthinking.”

“I saw the river carry you away yesterday.”

He sighed and touched his wrist, “I have no pulse.”

My eyes widened, and my mouth hung open.",29,10
1puphys,,I came closer to him. His skin was even paler than I thought at first. He smelled of wet mud. I touched his hand. There really was no pulse.,29,11
1puphys,,"“See what I mean?”

“Jesus, James.”

I quickly rushed to the medical cabinet and pulled out a blood pressure monitor.",20,12
1puphys,,"The blood pressure cuff tightened around his arm and then slowly deflated. No reading. “James, we need to contact the station.”

James got up and grabbed my hand.",28,13
1puphys,,"It was cold and damp. “Mark, wait, wait.",8,14
1puphys,,"We….we don’t know what they’ll say.”

“What?”

“What if….what if they decide to leave me here, or worse….do stuff to me.”

“James, don’t worry, we’re renowned academics; the institutions wouldn’t let anything happen to you.”

He still had a look of concern.",42,15
1puphys,,"“Okay, James, I’ll be vague, and you can tell them the details later.”

He nodded. I walked to the other room and picked up the satellite phone.",27,16
1puphys,,"“Dispatch, this is the senior researcher. My research partner fell into the river yesterday. He managed to survive, but I request immediate medical help.”

“This is dispatch.",27,17
1puphys,,"We are sending a boat immediately. What is your partner’s state?”

“He is conscious and communicating. No major injuries.”

“And you said he got carried by the river?”

“Yes”

Rattling.",30,18
1puphys,,"I could hear the headset being put down and quiet voices talking. “Field station, what is the color of your partner’s sclerae?”

“What….?”

“This is important.",26,19
1puphys,,"Please answer the question.”

“Um….they’re a sort of greenish-like color.”

A second of silence. “Help is on the way. We are unable to provide additional information.",26,20
1puphys,,"Be wary of any dangerous behavior from your research partner.”

Then static. “Dispatch, dispatch?!”

Nothing. I lowered the phone and stood up.",22,21
1puphys,,"My head was spinning, and my hands began shaking. I looked into the other room, and James was still sitting on the bed.",23,22
1puphys,,"In the cabinet, I only found a flare gun. I quickly put it behind my belt. Hopefully, I wouldn’t have to use it.",23,23
1puphys,,"When I came back to the room, James looked up. His sclerae were turning greener.",15,24
1puphys,,"“What did they say, Mark?”

“Oh, er….they are sending a boat immediately to come and pick us up.”

“Okay, did they say anything about me?”

“No, no, don’t worry about it.”

“I’m exhausted.",33,25
1puphys,,"I might go and sleep for a while.”

“Sure, they will arrive in like 5 hours. I’ll wake you before that.”

James didn’t even answer.",25,26
1puphys,,"His body slowly fell onto the bed. Mud started leaking out of his mouth. I sat on the foot of my bed, staring at him. My heart was beating fast.",30,27
1puphys,,"I didn’t even notice that a few hours had already passed. I tried to wake him up, but he wouldn’t at first. Then his eyes shot open.",27,28
1puphys,,They were completely green and shining bright. He quickly sat up and said something I couldn’t understand. Then he let out a roar and grabbed hold of me.,28,29
1puphys,,"“James, what are you doing?!”

He pushed me to the ground and grabbed my neck. His hands were still cold, and the squeeze was tight.",25,30
1puphys,,"Mud from his mouth was falling onto my face. My consciousness was slipping, but I managed to pull out my flare gun.",22,31
1puphys,,The room was coloured in bright red as I shot it into his stomach. The bang was so loud it made my ears ring.,24,32
1puphys,,He let out a scream of pain and stumbled a few feet back. Muddy water mixed with blood oozed out of his wound.,23,33
1puphys,,"I bolted for the door, running through the jungle. Adrenaline flooded my body. Vines were smacking my face. Then the boat. I jumped into the river and waded towards it.",30,34
1puphys,,But James’ roars were getting closer. I looked back. He was already in the river. One of the people in the boat got up and shot him in the head.,30,35
1puphys,,His body slouched down and began drifting on the stream.,10,36

1pujmdw,,I was shaking like a leaf as I walked in through the back door. I hurried to the restroom. I couldn’t stop thinking about her.,25,46
1pujmdw,,"What the fuck did I do? I hurt some old woman, maybe badly. But she was fucking nuts wasn’t she? She was crazy. I splashed my face with cold water.",30,47
1pujmdw,,The icy water running across my forehead made me feel ill.,11,48
1pujmdw,,Hot vomit scorched my tongue and came rushing past the back of my teeth as I spewed into the sink. They sent me home for that.,26,49
1pujmdw,,"As I collected my things from my locker, I heard some of those old dickheads making fun of me from across the room.",23,50
1pujmdw,,"“Widdle baby got a tummy ache.”

That got some serious laughs. Fuck those assholes. I left as quickly as I could, trying not to make eye contact with anyone.",29,51
1pujmdw,,"I slipped out the back door, looking from side to side to see if…idk…to see if she was out there.",20,52
1pujmdw,,The sun was just starting to go down as I opened the door to my car. I drove out of the lot slowly with my head on a swivel.,29,53
1pujmdw,,No old woman. No cops. I thought maybe it would all be alright. Maybe there was no other boot waiting to drop on my neck.,25,54
1pujmdw,,My stomach settled down a bit as I turned onto the highway. It got dark quickly as I made my way towards home.,23,55
1pujmdw,,"When I was about 30 minutes into my drive, my body and mind had begun to relax.",17,56
1pujmdw,,"As often happens on those long trips, the quiet hum of the road gave way to my wandering mind. My imagination flew long down the highway ahead of me.",29,57
1pujmdw,,"I could see myself cozying up in my favorite blanket on my living room sofa, playing some Switch, and watching YouTube.",21,58
1pujmdw,,A smile had just begun to creep across my face when it suddenly stopped in its tracks. I got a gnawing feeling in my gut.,25,59
1pujmdw,,You know that feeling you get when you’re being …watched. I didn’t want to turn my head and look but my body acted on its own.,26,60
1pujmdw,,"I looked out the driver’s side window and there she was, staring back at me with a look of malice as we cruised alongside one another.",26,61
1pujmdw,,I held her gaze for what seemed like forever. I was petrified. My mind reeled. Had she followed me? I sped up.,22,62
1pujmdw,,"I dangerously weaved from the right lane into the middle, cutting off an SUV.",14,63
1pujmdw,,I could see her old black sedan edging to the right and left of the vehicle between us.,18,64
1pujmdw,,The sallow headlights of her old car bent around the sides of the suv as she pushed for an opening to overtake.,22,65
1pujmdw,,She was boxed in on both sides but that didn’t stop her from honking and flashing her lights frantically.,19,66
1pujmdw,,I put the pedal to the floorboard and didn’t let up until I was 15 miles down the road. I’d overshot my exit but I didn’t care at that point.,30,67
1pujmdw,,I was so overcome with panic that I decided to get off at the next exit just to collect myself.,20,68
1pujmdw,,I found a small gas station a mile or so down the road from the exit.,16,69
1pujmdw,,I pulled in and parked behind the small storefront so that my car couldn’t be seen from the road. I turned off the engine and slumped down in my seat.,30,70
1pujmdw,,I cried. The stress had clenched my heart and I guess my body needed some sort of relief. I couldn’t understand why this was happening to me.,27,71
1pujmdw,,"Who was this insane woman and why the hell was I her prey? I wrung my hands, banged my head on the steering wheel, slapped myself.",26,72
1pujmdw,,"Anything I could do to pull myself together, I did. I wiped at my eyes, got out and went into the convenience store.",23,73
1pujmdw,,"The door bell went off as I entered the musty old shop. A friendly country voice rang out from the big man behind the counter, welcoming me to the store.",30,74
1pujmdw,,"“H-hey!” I tried to sound normal. “How’s it going?”

“Doing good! How’s abouts yourself?”
Hearing that deep fried country drawl somehow felt like a connection back to reality.",28,75
1pujmdw,,"“Brother, you wouldn’t believe me if I told ya,” I called back as I pulled a cold soda from the cooler. “Hell. Try me.",24,76
1pujmdw,,"I done heard it all before and twice on Sundays!”

I told him everything as I stood at the counter across from him.",23,77
1pujmdw,,"I told him about work, how I took my lunch breaks, and of course about the crazy old bat I couldn’t seem to shake.",24,78
1pujmdw,,It felt good getting it off of my chest. He laughed it all off until I got to the part about the highway.,23,79
1pujmdw,,“Ye say she was driving an old black 4 door?” He looked puzzled. “Uh-huh.,14,80
1pujmdw,,"Like an old 80s…”

“Towncar?”

“Yeah, I think you’re right.”

“And this ol gal, she was real skinny-like?",18,81
1pujmdw,,"White hair and a black dress?” A look of concern had replaced his formerly giddy expression. “That’s right…”

“Son.” He spoke in a whisper.",24,82
1pujmdw,,"“She’s in that washroom right back there you need to-”

The sound of the bathroom door’s lock opening behind my back cut him off in stride.",26,83
1pujmdw,,"The cashier flicked his eyes to his right. I followed in kind, moving behind the shelves of snacks. My heart thumped out of my chest. How could this be?!",29,84
1pujmdw,,"I heard slow, unsteady footsteps on the vinyl floor in the aisle adjacent to where I was crouched.",18,85
1pujmdw,,The old woman was making a low guttural wheezing sound as she slowly made her way towards the front. She smelled like ammonia and something sickly sweet.,27,86
1pujmdw,,I could see her in the reflection of the mirrored dome near the door.,14,87
1pujmdw,,"If I could see her, all she had to do was look up at it and she’d see me too.",20,88
1pujmdw,,"“Anything I can help you with there, ma’am?” The cashier spoke with his natural southern charm. She didn’t reply.",19,89
1pujmdw,,"She stared at him, her eyes lingering on him in that terrifying way I knew too well.",17,90
1pujmdw,,"“I said’s there anything I can help you with, darlin’?”

She opened her mouth and made a sound like a choking bullfrog. “Ma’am, are you alr-”

She tilted her head.",30,91
1pujmdw,,"“You followed me here, didn’t you?",6,92
1pujmdw,,"DIDN’T YOU?!”

“Uh, ma’am, I work he-”

Before he could get the words out, she was across the counter, with her long fingernails clawing at his throat.",27,93
1pujmdw,,The cashier yelped like a hurt dog. I could see blood in the reflection. I wasn’t sure whose it was as they struggled behind the counter.,26,94
1pujmdw,,Cigarette packs and bottles crashed to the floor.,8,95
1pujmdw,,"“FUCK OFFA ME, YA OLD BITCH!!”

The cashier swung out from behind the counter with the old woman clung to his chest like a monkey.",25,96
1pujmdw,,Her old withered fingers clawed at his face leaving thin red streaks of blood leaking down his cheeks. He tried to push her off of him.,26,97
1pujmdw,,"As the cashier backpedalled with the rabid woman still clawing at him, he tripped over a knocked over display.",19,98
1pujmdw,,The pair crashed into the shelf that I hid behind knocking cans of soup and bags of chips across the room. They went down hard.,25,99
1pujmdw,,The smell of iron burnt my nostrils as I looked into the security mirror. A crimson pool was forming around the back of the cashier’s head.,26,100
1pujmdw,,He laid there still fighting as the old woman’s fingers ripped and tore at his face. “NOT MY FUCKING EYES!! HELP!!” He called out desperately. I ran.,27,101
1pujmdw,,I didn't even think. I just ran to my car and turned the key in the ignition. The engine roared to life.,22,102
1pujmdw,,"I took off into the night, driving as fast as I could. I know. I'm a fucking coward.",18,103
1pujmdw,,I wanted to call the cops but in all my panic I couldn't even remember what sort of gas station it was. I couldn't even remember where it was.,29,104
1pujmdw,,"What was I going to do, call 911 and say be on the lookout for a killer old woman - she could be anywhere? I drove back home.",28,105
1pujmdw,,"I circled the block first of course, looking for any sign of her. I was so drained. I couldn't even bring myself to get out of the car.",28,106
1pujmdw,,I sat out front for 20 minutes or so just staring at my door. I thought about the cashier.,19,107
1pujmdw,,I thought about the crazy look in that evil old woman's eyes. I thought about home and my daydream of spending a comfy safe night in front of the TV.,30,108
1pujmdw,,"I thought about walking right in, locking the door behind me, and living that dream out.",16,109
1pujmdw,,"The only problem with that was…

As I looked through the window of my home, I was fairly sure that when I left the house that morning, I didn't leave the living room light on.",35,110
1puggr5,I have a long Commute.,I have a long commute to work. I work as a security guard for a public park.,17,0
1puggr5,,"It’s not the most ideal job or even my career goal, but it’s really hard to argue with 25 bucks an hour, Monday through Friday, 8 hours, 8pm-4am, more than worth the 2 hour commute I have to make for the job.",42,1
1puggr5,,Like I said it’s not ideal but I make enough to live.,12,2
1puggr5,,I’ve thought about moving closer to the park but I get by with my roommates right now and asking them to uproot their lives is a huge ask.,28,3
1puggr5,,So I just deal. The jobs are easy and the pay is good so the drive is really the only inconvenient part of the job.,25,4
1puggr5,,"Every night I switch off to the morning watchman, a guy named Harry, he’s an insane stoner who lives in the area and walks to work; kinda spacey but he’s cool.",31,5
1puggr5,,Once we switch off I start my commute back home.,10,6
1puggr5,,I’ve been doing this 5 days a week for about a year and until recently just fell into a nice routine with things. Last Monday I was driving home.,29,7
1puggr5,,"I have a weird bit of paranoia at night and have made a habit of checking my backseat while driving, turning on my cabin lights and briefly looking back.",29,8
1puggr5,,There's always nothing there and I always know nothing's gonna be there. But I can’t help it.,17,9
1puggr5,,"I looked back this time and saw a person under my car blanket sitting down staring at me in my rear view mirror, I froze.",25,10
1puggr5,,"Before you judge me, please answer me what exactly you’d do in this scenario.",14,11
1puggr5,,"You're driving on a backroad, the last bit of civilization was 30 minutes back, you look in your rear view and see a person you can’t see sitting up in your car, mind you, I’m a woman, this is a deep seeded fear of mine; I didn’t know his intentions with me.",52,12
1puggr5,,What would you do? What could you do? Take your hands off the wheel and attack the guy? Swerve into a ditch?,22,13
1puggr5,,Pull over and risk provoking this person who's been silently watching you for god knows how long? I started laughing.,20,14
1puggr5,,"I don’t know why, maybe it was a nervous breakdown, but I just couldn’t stop laughing.",16,15
1puggr5,,"Horrifically the person chuckled back which provoked me to laugh even more, we just laughed and laughed for 10 minutes of driving.",22,16
1puggr5,,Eventually I slowed down and came to my senses enough to try and assess the situation. He hadn’t killed me yet… he was laughing with me.,26,17
1puggr5,,Maybe he was prone to reason. So I hesitantly spoke. “H-hey man… so… you're not gonna kill me are you?” I said still chuckling a bit from my previous fit.,30,18
1puggr5,,The man under the blanket just stared at the rear view for a handful of seconds that felt like hours. “Not if you keep driving.,25,19
1puggr5,,"I just need to get to the Chevron here in Woodburn.”

I know it might sound stupid but that immediately washed my body with relief.",25,20
1puggr5,,Woodburn isn’t a hyper populated city but it’s a city. And the chevron was open with employees in the shop at 5 am. I could survive this. I said.,29,21
1puggr5,,"“Ok man… but-!”

The man immediately interrupted me. “Stop fucking talking bitch.”

My heart sank into my stomach.",18,22
1puggr5,,"He spoke with the cadence of a drunk dad at his limit, and he implied earlier he could kill me. I didn’t wanna provoke him. 30 minutes went by.",29,23
1puggr5,,I couldn’t help but continue to look back at the man in the back of my car.,17,24
1puggr5,,It was almost constant to the point that I nearly swerved into a ditch. This provoked him.,17,25
1puggr5,,"“Next time you look back here I’m gonna bite your fucking throat out.”

That was a new threat.",18,26
1puggr5,,But it put the fear of god in me and I stared at the endless Oregon backroad.,17,27
1puggr5,,"20 minutes went by, and I started feeling a wet breath creep down my back.",15,28
1puggr5,,"I kept my eyes on the road as his breathing got exasperated, hot, uncomfortable against my neck, my pupils dilated and time slowed.",23,29
1puggr5,,"10 more minutes went by and I felt something tug at my hair, the breathing extended to my head and I felt my hair roots heat up.",27,30
1puggr5,,"I pissed myself out of fear, something I’ve never done before.",11,31
1puggr5,,"Finally Woodburn was in sight, the Chevron was right off the backroad entrance and the second I saw it I nearly hit someone pulling into the station.",27,32
1puggr5,,"The second I my car stopped I slammed open my door and dove out of my car screaming for help leaving my car in drive, I ran towards the shop screaming for help.",33,33
1puggr5,,The gas station attendant followed me out to my car. It managed to stop on a blue pole sticking out of the cement and we looked in my passenger seat.,30,34
1puggr5,,But the dude wasn’t there. I cried. I begged the guy to believe me and call the police and he obliged.,21,35
1puggr5,,"Police investigated my car, I was crying to an officer the entire time recounting the scenario.",16,36
1puggr5,,"There was no evidence of tempering in my car, and I of course had no signs of trauma on me.",20,37
1puggr5,,"I couldn’t describe the man, cus he was under a blanket the entire time, there was nothing the cops could do and honestly I couldn’t even blame them… I was at a total loss myself.",35,38
1puggr5,,So now I’m on here… posting about it.,8,39
1puggr5,,"I’m having one of my roommates drive me and pick me up from work for the next couple weeks at least, I feel bad because he’s got the day off but he’s a great guy, we used to date and he still cares a lot about me so as long as I’m lying for gas he’s down.",57,40
1puggr5,,What the fuck happened to me? You think this was like… a hallucination?,13,41
1puggr5,,I just… I’m fucking scared… I haven’t been able to sleep for days thinking of what could’ve happened to me… and I’m just supposed to believe it wasn’t real?,29,42
1puggr5,,Any insights would be valuable… Thank you.,7,43

1pueg6v,,"As I stared at my mutilated hand, I felt a scream begin to rise within my chest.",17,78
1pueg6v,,"A loud groaning boomed through the room, as my attention snapped back to the locker. Just a few feet away, clung to the locker entrance, the thing sat.",28,79
1pueg6v,,"I could see it more clearly now, though as time goes the memory of its form begins to obfuscate.",19,80
1pueg6v,,I remember its bulbous face looking down at me with yellowed eyes as big as my head. Foul smelling saliva pooling onto the floor.,24,81
1pueg6v,,"Its body winded in the darkness like intestines, attached to some unseen mass within.",14,82
1pueg6v,,"The thing drew even closer, the excited clattering of a thousand segmented legs scraping against the walls.",17,83
1pueg6v,,"As it approached, its face leered at me in elation, its pupils expanding across the iris like an eclipse.",19,84
1pueg6v,,"The creature's mouth hung open, a large pockmarked tongue quivered and shook in its fetid maw.",16,85
1pueg6v,,"Behind stood a dark void of muscle and saliva, one that sent gusts of hot stinking breath across my face, one that drew closer every second.",26,86
1pueg6v,,The snapping and stretching of sinew echoed as the creature's mouth began to enclose me.,15,87
1pueg6v,,"At this precipice, all the terror, the pain of my hand, the sorrow of my life, the loneliness, melted away from my adolescent mind.",24,88
1pueg6v,,"I was going to die a brutal, painful death… I was going to be eaten. I have never judged a murderer.",21,89
1pueg6v,,"Though I have never taken another person's life, there is a strange rush that fills you when you stand just at the edge of death.",25,90
1pueg6v,,I can only imagine it feels the same taking a life.,11,91
1pueg6v,,"It is in those moments that a clarity of purpose is revealed, the desperate struggle for survival that defines all beasts existence is made manifest.",25,92
1pueg6v,,"I remember that moment as clear as day. Something sharp had found its way into my hand, something sharp and heavy.",21,93
1pueg6v,,"Before the thing's jaws snapped around me, it hesitated, letting out a horrific choking sound. I swung, letting out a hoarse cry of defiance, and hit flesh.",27,94
1pueg6v,,"There was a piercing scream, like that of a dying woman, and a burst of ochre fluid spilled over me. I scrambled back, before I broke out into a sprint.",30,95
1pueg6v,,"Concrete and steel became a blur as I tore my way through the Packhouse, all the while the thing’s voice boomed through the structure, reverberating off the walls.",28,96
1pueg6v,,"What was once a soothing maternal sound now burned through my body like a raging fire. Its words rattled from the depths of its throat, guttural and hateful. “ROTTED FLESH!",30,97
1pueg6v,,"POISON BLOOD!” It wailed, “GO! YOU ARE BAD MEAT! BAD MEAT!” 

Dull light offered me no relief as I burst into the day, the creature's words leaving my ears ringing.",30,98
1pueg6v,,"My feet slammed against the cracked pavement of the exit as I ran, leaving the Packhouse to become consumed again by the cornfields. I didn't stop, I remember that.",29,99
1pueg6v,,"I didn't stop for anything. I didn't stop until I got home. I knew no one would believe a kid like me, so I lied.",25,100
1pueg6v,,"I never spoke of what happened. I remember the stitches, I remember the scolding that followed the story of my unfortunate accident.",22,101
1pueg6v,,"I remember the sleepless nights, the nightmares, and the eyes. Most of all I remember a strange feeling, one that never left. I was spoiled, unfit for consumption.",28,102
1pueg6v,,"I'll be a father soon. I can only hope my daughter will inherit my misgivings, my flaws.",17,103
1pueg6v,,"My greatest hope for her is that she will be like me, broken and malignant. Humans are food, meant for consumption by the things that lurk within the void.",29,104
1pueg6v,,"I have no grand aspirations for her, no dreams of a better future.",13,105
1pueg6v,,"Humans are food, so I pray every night to the formless, shapeless god of chance that my infant child will be nothing more than a wastrel.",26,106
1pueg6v,,"A dreg, ill-suited even to be meat.",7,107
1pudvt3,I’ve been stuck driving on the same road that I died on for the last three years,I truly believe that some of the most bone chilling stories are the ones that have never been told.,19,0
1pudvt3,,"If you think about it, those that are able to recollect and tell their stories are the reason folklore exists at all.",22,1
1pudvt3,,The dead are limited in their ability to transcribe the series of events that led them to where they rest today.,21,2
1pudvt3,,I think that in itself is a terrifying aspect of the unknown.,12,3
1pudvt3,,"Without the knowledge passed on by those braver than you, you’re just as blind as they were, while they were still alive.",22,4
1pudvt3,,"I died a good while back, on the highway while heading back home.",13,5
1pudvt3,,"For the last three or so years, I’ve been stuck in this place that isn’t heaven or hell. Maybe it’s purgatory? I’m not entirely sure.",25,6
1pudvt3,,All I know is that I’ve been stuck driving on the same road that I died on for the last three years.,22,7
1pudvt3,,"While I can step out of my Ute and walk around, there’s not really a point, as my surroundings are dark and desolate.",23,8
1pudvt3,,"If everything wasn’t illuminated by either my headlights or the faint, otherworldly hue, then I would be faced with unimaginable darkness.",21,9
1pudvt3,,"It’s not entirely empty either, driving along I see things ranging from crashed vehicles, my own Ute and body nearly unrecognisably mangled in the middle of the road, or roadkill that walks and hops despite broken bones and huge chunks of flesh missing from their bodies.",46,10
1pudvt3,,"While I do see the occasional human being, I try my best to avoid them.",15,11
1pudvt3,,I find that newcomers are the most prone to violent bouts of aggression as they go through the five stages of grief in here.,24,12
1pudvt3,,"I’ve only ever let one other person into my vehicle in the last three years, and it’s a mistake that I will never make again.",25,13
1pudvt3,,"It all started as I was heading home late one night. Looking back on it, I should’ve just pulled over and slept, or napped, or anything.",26,14
1pudvt3,,"But overconfidence pushed me to drive seven hours home, despite not having slept in the last two days.",18,15
1pudvt3,,"I had multiple coffees and energy drinks, and stopped occasionally to piss and splash my face with cold water, but I was still feeling myself slipping the whole way.",29,16
1pudvt3,,"My ego wouldn’t let me sleep on the side of the road due to how uncivilised it seemed, and my fear wouldn’t let me as I imagined teens, thieves or worse catching me while I slept.",36,17
1pudvt3,,"Now, not only do I sleep in my Ute in the infinite blackness of the void, I hear things outside scratching and tapping at my doors and windows, eager to come inside.",32,18
1pudvt3,,I was about two thirds of the way home when I closed my eyes far longer than I should have.,20,19
1pudvt3,,"Though it was night while I was heading home, when I awoke I could immediately tell that something wasn’t right.",20,20
1pudvt3,,"It’s the same feeling you get when you’re lucid dreaming, that awareness that everything around you isn’t real as you float listlessly in your thoughts.",25,21
1pudvt3,,I stepped out of my Ute with the headlights still on as I gathered myself.,15,22
1pudvt3,,"I felt… fuzzy, sort of when your limbs that fell asleep start receiving circulation again, and the pins and needles fade away.",22,23
1pudvt3,,"It was that feeling, but constant, across my entire body. I felt cold, but I couldn’t really feel my surroundings. I think that’s when it really dawned on me.",29,24
1pudvt3,,"I couldn’t hear anything or feel anything around me, sure I could hear my heartbeat and pinch my skin, but everything else was just… numb…

I saw my decimated vehicle in the middle of the road, looking like crumbled up wrapping paper.",42,25
1pudvt3,,"It remember my first time seeing it vividly, because it essentially just behind my Ute, as the faint red glow of my rear lights revealed it in an ominous glow.",30,26
1pudvt3,,"I didn’t need to get too close to see my body torn in half, splayed over the bonnet and steering wheel like a doll.",24,27
1pudvt3,,"My bones protruded out of my arms, legs and torso, while my head looked partially caved in.",17,28
1pudvt3,,"From the way it looked, I have to think that I swerved into a truck coming in the opposite lane.",20,29
1pudvt3,,"My hypothesis was based on how my Ute went from looking like a terrier to a pug, with a noticeable amount of damage present to the frame that couldn’t be the result of a hatchback or a sedan collision.",39,30
1pudvt3,,"Though in all honesty, I have no idea what exactly happened. Just that I hit some cunts’ vehicle, and that I died while he survived.",25,31
1pudvt3,,Something that I realised quickly was that my truck didn’t require fuel.,12,32
1pudvt3,,"Not only that, as long as I kept it on the road and avoided hitting the living roadkill and other hazards, my Ute can keep going forever.",27,33
1pudvt3,,"I didn’t need food, but anything I found that I could eat comforted me, despite not feeling hungry or full afterwards.",21,34
1pudvt3,,"One thing I realised on the second or third person I ran into was that you should never, under any circumstances, attempt to make a U-turn and drive back the way you came.",33,35
1pudvt3,,"You should and can only drive forward. If you realised you’ve left something behind, just get over it, because you’re not getting it back.",24,36
1pudvt3,,"While I was still new, I met this Asian fella looking at his own body that had propelled itself from his windshield to about five metres away from his car.",30,37
1pudvt3,,"His suit ripped in tatters as a trail of blood and flesh bits followed a metre or two back, I could grimly imagine m what the front of his body looked like as it was grated against the rough, tar road.",41,38
1pudvt3,,"“Where- Where am I?” He blurted, It was easy to tell that English wasn’t his first language, so I spoke as calmly, coherently and slowly as possible.",27,39
1pudvt3,,"“I’m sorry mate, but you’re dead” I said bluntly.",9,40
1pudvt3,,"No- No… Can’t be…” he looked around, both at his original wrecked car and the one he had parked on the opposite side of the highway.",26,41
1pudvt3,,"“Where is she?… Where…?” He asked, as he approached me with his wallet opened, inside was a picture of himself and what I assumed to be his daughter, no older than six or seven.",34,42
1pudvt3,,"“She must be alive still, I’d consider yourself lucky.” I replied, at this point, he started speaking either Chinese or Vietnamese (I couldn’t really tell) and got back in his car.",31,43
1pudvt3,,I saw him make a u-bolt and head the opposite way.,11,44
1pudvt3,,"I watched as he drove out to where I could only faintly see his headlights, before seeing the faint silhouette of his car falling as though it was pushed off a cliff.",32,45
1pudvt3,,"For a brief second, I swore I could see his headlights shine from under the ground as he spiralled and spun before melting into the void.",26,46
1pudvt3,,I can’t imagine what happens if you manage to die here too.,12,47
1pudvt3,,"Maybe it’s complete void like a dreamless sleep, or maybe you do end up in heaven or hell and this is just an awkward pit stop to the great beyond.",30,48
1pudvt3,,"I haven’t the faintest clue what awaits me, maybe it’s better than this place, maybe it’s worse? My greatest fear is that beyond this, there is simply nothing at all.",30,49
1pudvt3,,"I try not to think about that while I’m driving, but the thought comes and goes as easily as the bloody kangaroos that litter the highway.",26,50
1pudvt3,,"At this point, you may be thinking to yourself how exactly am I posting these if I’m dead? To be completely honest.",22,51
1pudvt3,,I have no idea if these are going to reach anybody really. My phone still works and the battery doesn’t drop no matter how long I can use it.,29,52
1pudvt3,,"I can’t seem to get into YouTube or Spotify though which is a shame, since there’s this podcast I really like listening to when I was driving to and from home.",31,53
1pudvt3,,"I can post things on websites but when I check homepages or anything, my phone freaks the fuck out and I have to shut it down and start it up again to make it work.",35,54
1pudvt3,,"The first time I did that, I was shitting myself thinking I lost the ability to look at my kid’s texts.",21,55
1pudvt3,,"But after it turned on again, I realised it was fine and everything was still on it. Driving becomes its own hell when you can’t listen to anything.",28,56
1pudvt3,,I’d take listening to shitty radio stations than nothing at all.,11,57
1pudvt3,,"The silence just leaves you with your thoughts, or it highlights a rattle you didn’t think was there before so now you can’t stop hearing it.",26,58
1pudvt3,,"Before realising that my existence depends on looking at the road, I would check my phone while driving, scrolling through old messages, trying to send messages only to encounter an error, or listen to videos I had saved on my camera roll.",42,59
1pudvt3,,Another thing you gotta do is to always keep your eyes on the road. Always. Because there is some strange shit in here that isn’t animal or human.,28,60
1pudvt3,,I was looking through pictures I took of a cruise with my now ex-wife as I caught something from the corner of my eye.,24,61
1pudvt3,,"At first I thought I was seeing an impossibly large wombat, but its hair was dark and smooth looking, almost glistening like it was wet.",25,62
1pudvt3,,Of course my first instinct was to stay on my phone and drive around it.,15,63
1pudvt3,,"As even if I did manage to hit it, I’ve hit the living roadkill in here before and they just get right back up after going under my tires.",29,64
1pudvt3,,"But as soon as I looked back down at my phone, in the middle of the cruise picture I was looking at, I saw that thing, and it looked like it was getting closer.",34,65
1pudvt3,,"My eyes fell back onto the road, where I saw it looking directly at me, it’s eyes indescribably bright as I quickly swerved around it, it’s eyes now burned into mine as I felt it’s bold gaze linger in front of me for a few minutes before dissipating.",48,66
1pudvt3,,"Something about its eyes and the way it looked at me felt eerily familiar, I near about had a panic attack afterwards as my memory of the thing seemed to deteriorate after passing it.",34,67
1pudvt3,,I see it now glaring at me from outside my window in the dark fields on my left.,18,68
1pudvt3,,"So unless I want more glaring at me, I’ll do my best and keep my eyes on the road.",19,69
1pudvt3,,"I’ve yet to find a bottle-o here, though if I’m lucky I’ll find strangers with slabs full of beer.",19,70
1pudvt3,,This year I saw a guy in a small hatchback parked on the side of the road.,17,71
1pudvt3,,"Now usually I’m very wary of others, both in life and… wherever this was.",14,72
1pudvt3,,"But at that point, I hadn’t spoken to anyone for weeks, and I wasn’t feeling great after dealing with the last person I met in here.",26,73
1pudvt3,,"I didn’t care though, and parked up a bit behind them and greeted them. I approached a young man, curly hair, couldn’t be older than twenty-five.",26,74
1pudvt3,,I’m sure my forty-year-old ass was intimidating as I saw him back away when I greeted him.,17,75
1pudvt3,,"“Hey mate, you new here?” He looked me up and down, as his hand felt behind him for his door handle.",21,76
1pudvt3,,"“Sorry to bother ya, I just want to talk-“ he kept grabbing at the handle, unable to get it open.",20,77
1pudvt3,,He turned away from me and began furiously pulling at the door handle.,13,78
1pudvt3,,"If he wasn’t built like a twig, I would’ve rooted for him pulling the door off its hinges. Instead he gave up and ended up running into the darkness.",29,79
1pudvt3,,"I called out to him, as there was no way I’m going out into that abyss with no vehicle or light. “It’s your funeral mate, I just wanted to talk!",30,80
1pudvt3,,"Don’t let the ghouls get ya!” 

I chortled, sometimes I get so bored I amuse myself. I peered into his small, black hatchback.",23,81
1pudvt3,,"He was lucky that cars don’t really break down here, cause his black shit-box barely passed as a paddock-basher.",19,82
1pudvt3,,"It was old, very old, with stained seats and a whole lot of trash on the floor.",17,83
1pudvt3,,"Hidden in the backseat, I could see a slab of beer partially covered in a blue tarp. I checked each door, before realising he locked himself out of his car.",30,84
1pudvt3,,"I couldn’t help but feel bad for the guy, so I decided to help him out. I think the slab is more than adequate payment.",25,85
1pudvt3,,"I don’t know if I imagined being drunk or if the alcohol actually had an affect on me, but that was the best day I had in weeks.",28,86
1pudvt3,,"This old road extends beyond reality itself. Sometimes the memories of what once was leaks into this place, dotting the sides of this barren highway.",25,87
1pudvt3,,"These memories take the forms of locations; old gas stations, small homes; all of them seem to find their way here eventually.",22,88
1pudvt3,,That’s where I manage to grab my food and beer from. I fondly remember finding the servo I used to visit as a kid on the side of the highway.,30,89
1pudvt3,,I parked my Ute near the rusted pumps and headed inside.,11,90
1pudvt3,,"The place was almost exactly how I remembered it, with a barrel of lollipops near the registers, bottles of energy drink and cold coffee in the dark fridges and the slushy machine right next to the warmers full of meat pies and sausage rolls.",44,91
1pudvt3,,"Sadly, the place was rather dilapidated.",6,92
1pudvt3,,"Not completely run down mine you, best I can describe it is when a store hasn’t been cleaned in a day, and you’re the last one there as everyone else has gone home.",33,93
1pudvt3,,"There wasn’t any power, but the otherworldly hue from the ground illuminated the place just enough for me to make out my surroundings.",23,94
1pudvt3,,There was plenty of snacks and canned drinks ripe for the taking.,12,95
1pudvt3,,"Though just as I was stuffing my pockets and hands with as much as I could carry, I heard something else enter the building.",24,96
1pudvt3,,"I looked up at the dirty safety mirror in the top corner, as I saw a large, shadowy figure enter. It moved unnaturally, struggling on horse like legs.",28,97
1pudvt3,,"It was frail, moving with great weight, dripping dark ichor onto the ground below it. It looked up and faced the mirror, looking at me with those bright, ineffable eyes.",30,98
1pudvt3,,"The thing was following me, and I saw no reason in sticking around.",13,99
1pudvt3,,I managed to sneak over the counter and quietly went out the employee fire exit before booking it to my Ute.,21,100
1pudvt3,,"I started it up and left, seeing the thing looking at me in my rear view mirror.",17,101
1pudvt3,,"I made sure to carry my hunting knife with me each time I explored from then on. That- whatever it is, isn’t the only thing that creeps me out.",29,102
1pudvt3,,"Though they are hard to see, you can occasionally spot concealed driveways and dirt roads leading to gates branching off the main highway.",23,103
1pudvt3,,"I was still relatively new when I first came across one of them, now I try my best not to look at them as I pass them by.",28,104
1pudvt3,,"Back then, my curiosity got the best of me, and I got out to look at where it lead to.",20,105
1pudvt3,,"The dirt road lead to a metre tall gate, with rusted barbed wire and poles stretching endlessly into the darkness.",20,106
1pudvt3,,"On the gate, was a large, wooden sign painted in red and black that simply read…

 

THE BEND

 

I took a squiz just past the gate, and saw the edge of the world.",33,107
1pudvt3,,A few metres past the gate lead to a sheer drop that sunk into nothingness.,15,108
1pudvt3,,"As I was standing out there, I swore I could faintly hear whispers in the darkness. Though when I looked around, nothing was there.",24,109
1pudvt3,,"At least, nothing I could see anyways.",7,110
1pudvt3,,"I think I checked two other side roads after that one, those roads went a bit further than my light could reveal, but I got a real bad feeling from them.",31,111
1pudvt3,,The last one I saw looked exactly like the gate outside the home of an old friend of mine. He died about ten years back in a car accident.,29,112
1pudvt3,,"I don’t like checking them anymore. I drove for a while with the first person I met here. He went by Shane, and he seemed pretty experienced.",27,113
1pudvt3,,"He was a bit skinner, wearing a blue flannel and a dark Stetson hat.",14,114
1pudvt3,,"If everything he said was true, then he is the only man I know who has survived the longest in here.",21,115
1pudvt3,,"His Ute was filled with rifles, chains, hunting knives and a few first aid kits.",15,116
1pudvt3,,"Funnily enough, my first meeting with the cunt was having his gun pointed at my head. Being the scared newcomer I was, I let him do whatever he wanted.",29,117
1pudvt3,,"After searching my Ute from top to bottom, he went to his Ute to grab something.",16,118
1pudvt3,,The hand that once carried the gun that was pressed against my temple now had a cold beer in it.,20,119
1pudvt3,,"“Sorry mate, I had to check for any Yowies” He said gruffly. I was nervous at first, but I took the offering and cracked it open.",26,120
1pudvt3,,"I remember asking a whole lot of useless questions, like “what is this place?”, “why are we here?”, shit like that.",21,121
1pudvt3,,"“What do you mean Yowies?” I finally asked, to which he gave a wide, toothless grin. “They’re the things that wander around ‘ere. I reckon you’ll find one soon enough.",30,122
1pudvt3,,"Big, dark things that ooze…” He pulled the sleeve on his right hand, showing a missing index finger that once connected to a black stub. He mumbled quietly.",28,123
1pudvt3,,"“Ooze that’s cold and wet, but it burns… it sucks, and it burns… Dream like things, lost spirits that have lost themselves in this place…” 

I wasn’t sure how much of his ramblings were of real events, or half-imagined ones.",40,124
1pudvt3,,"I just knew not to belittle the man who could blow a clean hole through my brains. Though it wasn’t stated outright, I felt obligated to follow Shane.",28,125
1pudvt3,,"That and he made me drive before him, whether it was so it was easier to shoot me, or if it was for my vehicle to protect his for whatever was out there, I’m still unsure of.",37,126
1pudvt3,,He forced me into old houses that manifested on the side of the highway.,14,127
1pudvt3,,"Each time he asked me-

“Do these look familiar to you?”

Each time he did, I said no. All of the houses seemed foreign to me.",26,128
1pudvt3,,"Some were brick, others were timber, all of them old fashioned. They had a late sixties, vintage style, accompanied by classic cars outside.",23,129
1pudvt3,,They looked as if someone picked up a house in the middle of the country and dropped them right next to the highway.,23,130
1pudvt3,,"Shane would push me inside, gun poking my back, as he made me scout them out.",16,131
1pudvt3,,"I checked them room by room, giving updates and giving him anything I managed to find as he waited outside.",20,132
1pudvt3,,"Each of those homes were falling apart, wallpaper peeling off like sunburnt skin and mould sprawled across the ceiling and walls.",21,133
1pudvt3,,"I was hoping that there’d be a weapon I could use to defend myself, though the most I could find were old kitchen knives and potato mashers.",27,134
1pudvt3,,"Still, I held onto the hope that I would be free of Shane at some point, but those first few weeks were tough.",23,135
1pudvt3,,As he had some quirks that made him a cunt to be around.,13,136
1pudvt3,,"Besides his eagerness to apply violence to yield morbid gains, he was extremely opinionated and had an extremely short fuse.",20,137
1pudvt3,,"He kept going on to how all the good jobs were being outsourced, despite the fact that we’re both dead now.",21,138
1pudvt3,,I usually just nodded and pretend to agree with most of what he said.,14,139
1pudvt3,,"The only good thing about having him around was that it made the time go by quicker, but time holds no meaning here so I’m not sure how much worth that has anymore.",33,140
1pudvt3,,"He told me a little about how he ended up here, not that I had a choice in the matter.",20,141
1pudvt3,,"When someone has your life in their hands and ask you “Do you wanna hear a story?”, the safest thing to say is yes.",24,142
1pudvt3,,Best case scenario he just keeps yapping and ignores your input.,11,143
1pudvt3,,"He was a hunter that would sneak into large properties to hunt game, primarily deer and boars in the dead of night.",22,144
1pudvt3,,"He had caught a sow and three piglets, he had them chained in the back of his Ute and driving along the highway when he caught on to police lights from his rear.",33,145
1pudvt3,,He sped up trying to evade them before eventually being caught.,11,146
1pudvt3,,"The police cruiser parked right in front of him, giving him enough time to “give the bastard what he deserved”.",20,147
1pudvt3,,"In what I can only assume was a fit of blind rage, he had shot the cop right where he stood, and realising the consequences of his actions, got back into his Ute and started speeding home.",37,148
1pudvt3,,"He didn’t even make it a kilometre down the M1 when a kangaroo jumped out and collided with him, sending him down into a creek where he drowned.",28,149
1pudvt3,,Hearing that story explained why his Ute always seemed damp and smelled the way it did.,16,150
1pudvt3,,I think I put up with him for about three weeks before something significant happened.,15,151
1pudvt3,,"We were searching inside this house together, and this time he came in with me as opposed to just waiting outside like he usually did.",25,152
1pudvt3,,"I just figured he was bored and wanted a change of scenery, but something about how he was looking around the place and moved through it’s withered halls made me think that it was something more significant to him.",39,153
1pudvt3,,"I was going down this dark hallway, as he was the only one allowed to hold one of his many flashlights when I heard him make this loud, almost feminine shriek.",31,154
1pudvt3,,"I turned around and watched this huge, dark creature grab a hold of him from under an old bed.",19,155
1pudvt3,,"Its arm was huge but thin, with stringent muscle connecting to its shrivelled forearm.",14,156
1pudvt3,,He had dropped his gun and flashlight as he was crawling and gouging at the timber floorboards underneath him.,19,157
1pudvt3,,"His nails ripping out of his hands, sticking out of the floorboards as his screams filled those hallowed halls. “Fucking help me John, you useless cunt!” he screamed and whined.",30,158
1pudvt3,,He looked at me with this desperation that almost made me consider saving him. I immediately reached for the gun and torch.,22,159
1pudvt3,,"Seeing as I still had the opportunity, I raised the worn rifle up, aimed, and fired into Shane’s side.",19,160
1pudvt3,,"He coughed up blood as he glared at me, pain and anger pooling in his dark eyes as he was pulled under the bed.",24,161
1pudvt3,,"I let that thing keep his body as I ran to my Ute and drove off, laughing the whole way like ol’ bloody Saint Nick.",25,162
1pudvt3,,"I was reborn, moulted by newfound freedom, my head throbbing as the adrenaline wore off. I remember the feeling of liberation I had when I was finally free of him.",30,163
1pudvt3,,"But until then I was fearful, not just because he had a gun pointed at me most of the time, but by the thought of what waited for me beyond this place.",32,164
1pudvt3,,I think that was the catalyst for my intrigue into the *after*\-after life.,13,165
1pudvt3,,"I reflected a lot after dealing with Shane, if he taught me anything, it was that in this place you only have two options.",24,166
1pudvt3,,"You either pass on to whatever awaits us beyond, or you keep going, trying to find meaning on this long, dark road that never ends.",25,167
1pudvt3,,I thought I found meaning in Julie.,7,168
1pudvt3,,"I came across this younger lady, who was the first women I had seen in here, and I spotted her crying on the side of the road in front of her blue sedan.",33,169
1pudvt3,,"She looked like she was in her mid-thirties, with silky dark hair and these bright brown eyes.",17,170
1pudvt3,,"I had gotten out of my car to greet her, as she ran up to me and gripped onto my flannel. “What is this place?! Where’s my husband?!",28,171
1pudvt3,,Where’s my son..!” She spoke between sobs as she beat her fists against my chest. I looked over at the car wreck sprawled across the road.,26,172
1pudvt3,,The debris scattered farther than my headlights could show.,9,173
1pudvt3,,"If you didn’t come here with the same car you died in, I wouldn’t have had the faintest idea of what type of car she was driving.",27,174
1pudvt3,,"It was so badly mangled and compact that it looked like it was used in those test trials, where they smash cars against a wall at hundreds of kilometres an hour.",31,175
1pudvt3,,"I stood there rather awkwardly looking back at it. As history can attest to, I was not the best at consoling women in distress.",24,176
1pudvt3,,"I just let her get her feelings out, before she looked up at me with wet, red eyes. “I’m sorry ma’am, but you’ve passed on.",25,177
1pudvt3,,"If your husband and child aren’t here, than I can only assume that they are still alive.” I said as compassionately as I could manage.",25,178
1pudvt3,,I didn’t have the heart to tell her what condition they must have been in.,15,179
1pudvt3,,"I’ve seen people wheelchair bound after car accidents, and one who laid in a coma until their family pulled the plug on them after half a decade.",27,180
1pudvt3,,"I’m not sure what it waits for those who pass outside this road, but I can only imagine how her spouse and son had survived such a mess.",28,181
1pudvt3,,"I gave her a rundown of everything I knew inside her sedan, what my theories were (still banking on this being some sort of purgatory), what ghouls I have seen roaming around, I mentioned the story of the guy doing a u-bolt but didn’t tell her about Shane, as I didn’t want to scare her with the threat that man still posed in this place.",65,182
1pudvt3,,"“That’s all I know so far, I wish you the best, I may not see you again when I leave and-“

“Wait!” she blurted out, before her voice dropped to a whisper.",32,183
1pudvt3,,"“Please… Can I ride with you?”

I sat in my Ute and boiled over on the idea.",17,184
1pudvt3,,"I wasn’t sure how big of a risk it was bringing someone else, maybe that thing that killed Shane was only there because we were both in the house at the same time?",33,185
1pudvt3,,There were too many unknowns and what-ifs to make a rational decision.,12,186
1pudvt3,,"At the time I had to consider that after each stranger I passed, I never saw them on the road again.",21,187
1pudvt3,,Would it be so bad to have some better company on the road? “Sure” I stated. “Just stay behind me.,20,188
1pudvt3,,"If I go before you, then it gives you a chance to escape if something happens to me…” She hugged me after I said that, and for a second, I considered hugging her back.",34,189
1pudvt3,,"The temptation was strong, but I settled with a firm pat on the back. Maybe I’ll talk more about her, once I have more beer.",25,190
1pudvt3,,"I’m not sure if anyone will see this, but writing all this down has helped out a lot.",18,191
1pudvt3,,"Plus, it’s a breath of fresh air as opposed to driving endlessly on the road. Until then I plan on driving and hopefully finding another slab.",26,192
1pudvt3,,"If I pray, then hopefully I can manifest a drive through bottle-o and grab enough grog to forget everything.",19,193
1pudvt3,,Maybe the key to leaving this place is to get absolutely smashed. That’s the dream anyways. I’ll write more down if I feel like it.,25,194
1puc5kb,The Quiet Stretch (Part 2),"[Part One](

Upon entering the empty highway, I immediately applied the brakes. I didn’t want to head any further. I wanted to turn around.",24,0
1puc5kb,,"I looked into the rear-view mirror, and it showed a hitchhiker, donning a hoodie and standing near the road, gesturing.",20,1
1puc5kb,,"I immediately stepped down from the truck and looked around, once, twice, thrice, but there was no one. The toll plaza was no longer behind me.",26,2
1puc5kb,,"There was only an endless highway, dimly lit by an unseen light source, stretching forward without variation.",17,3
1puc5kb,,"I had no option left but to travel ahead and find an exit, any exit. I climbed back into the truck and started driving again.",25,4
1puc5kb,,"Fear accompanied me, and it wore the shape of the hitchhiker.",11,5
1puc5kb,,"He was still present in the rear-view mirror, motionless, as if the mirror were a camera displaying a live feed. Throughout the drive, I wasn’t just scared.",27,6
1puc5kb,,"I was confused, sweating profusely. The truck produced no sound, as if it were an electric vehicle, only quieter. I realized then that the silence wasn’t accidental.",27,7
1puc5kb,,"It felt selective, as though certain things were being taken away deliberately. Meanwhile, my habit took over. I tried honking in the same pattern as before.",26,8
1puc5kb,,It was a reflex rather than a decision. The horn didn’t make a sound. That was when I understood that it wasn’t just the truck that had gone quiet.,29,9
1puc5kb,,Sound itself was no longer behaving the way it should.,10,10
1puc5kb,,"After what might have been several miles, I saw someone standing right beside the road, gesturing in the same way as the hitchhiker in the mirror.",26,11
1puc5kb,,"I had no choice but to approach. He was wearing a hoodie, looking in the opposite direction.",17,12
1puc5kb,,"I slowed the truck and reached the spot, and what sent chills through me wasn’t the hitchhiker ahead of me, it was the fact that the rear-view mirror now showed nothing, just the empty highway behind me.",37,13
1puc5kb,,"I couldn’t fathom the behavior of the road or my surroundings. The hitchhiker remained still, unmoving.",16,14
1puc5kb,,"I didn’t know whether I should step down or not, and something within me resisted the idea entirely as my heart raced.",22,15
1puc5kb,,"After a brief, frantic conversation with myself, I decided to leave him where he was and not disturb him. I pressed the accelerator and tried to move past him.",29,16
1puc5kb,,"Nothing happened. I tried again, still nothing. Even after the tenth attempt, the truck refused to move. I had no option left but to step out.",26,17
1puc5kb,,"The road hummed unusually beneath my feet, vibrating with a low, unnatural intensity.",13,18
1puc5kb,,"It wasn’t loud, but it was persistent, as though it had replaced the sounds that should have been there.",19,19
1puc5kb,,"I slowly stepped towards the hitchhiker, who remained frozen and completely unmoving. I walked past him, and then he moved. He avoided eye contact and said nothing at all.",29,20
1puc5kb,,"He simply began walking towards the truck, climbed in, and sat beside the driver’s seat.",15,21
1puc5kb,,"As he did, I noticed his chest rise slightly, as if to breathe, and then stop halfway, frozen in a failed attempt at something human.",25,22
1puc5kb,,"Right after he sat down, a new image appeared in the rear-view mirror. It looked like a gas station, very dimly lit, with a truck parked beside it.",28,23
1puc5kb,,"That probably meant my next destination was a gas station. Meanwhile, the hitchhiker released a faint humming noise, as if he were mimicking the road, the highway itself.",28,24
1puc5kb,,"His throat produced an inhuman vibration, and I could feel it beneath my seat, through the very frame of the truck. I dared not ask anything.",26,25
1puc5kb,,"My heart was already in my mouth, and I didn’t want to collapse right there by doing something stupid. I didn’t want to attract his attention.",26,26
1puc5kb,,"But something within me was still curious, desperate to know if he was human, if he could respond to a question.",21,27
1puc5kb,,"After half an hour of complete silence, I dared to break it. “Hello,” I said. “Sir?” He didn’t respond. He continued humming, frozen, his gaze locked onto the rear-view mirror.",30,28
1puc5kb,,"Moments later, it wasn’t his silence that unsettled me most, it was the fact that I didn’t hear my own voice when I spoke.",24,29
1puc5kb,,Even my own voice wasn’t audible to me. I wondered if the transition from the normal highway to this one had deafened me. The thought deeply unsettled me.,28,30
1puc5kb,,"It no longer felt like coincidence. First the horn, then my voice.",12,31
1puc5kb,,"Whatever this place was, it seemed to strip sound away in layers, leaving only what it wanted to keep.",19,32
1puc5kb,,"Something within me was quite certain now that asking again wouldn’t be a good idea. It didn’t matter anymore. I couldn’t hear myself, and the silence felt profoundly wrong.",29,33
1puc5kb,,"His humming was the only sound tearing through the quiet. The truck, which normally vibrated because of the engine, now vibrated because of him.",24,34
1puc5kb,,That hum convinced me he was less than human. A normal person would need to pause to breathe. He didn’t. He wasn’t breathing at all.,25,35
1puc5kb,,It was taking me more than courage to live through all that. I was constantly cursing my decision of having become a truck driver.,24,36
1puc5kb,,"It felt like I was lured into that job by the universe itself, as though this road had been waiting for someone like me to notice it.",27,37
1puc5kb,,"Just how a normal trucker would, I looked to my right. What happened next made me keep my head straight ahead for the rest of the route.",27,38
1puc5kb,,"Looking to my right, I could see a road being built in real time. It stretched far beyond what my eyes could follow.",23,39
1puc5kb,,"A truck, moving with the speed of a jet, came hurling towards me. Terror seized me, and I immediately looked ahead again, accelerating fully.",24,40
1puc5kb,,"To my surprise, my head movement caused the approaching truck to disappear, along with the road itself. I tried looking again for a fraction of a second.",27,41
1puc5kb,,"The highway rebuilt itself in unison with my vision. I immediately looked straight ahead. That was enough. I understood then that this place responded not to movement, but to attention.",30,42
1puc5kb,,That meant I mustn’t look to my right or left.,10,43
1puc5kb,,"Although I had no courage left to test the left side, only a fool wouldn’t understand that it had to work both ways.",23,44
1puc5kb,,"Meanwhile, the hitchhiker hummed constantly, adding to the unease relentlessly. My heart hummed in unison, not with rhythm, but with fear.",21,45
1puc5kb,,"The gas station was still visible in the mirror, and so was the truck parked beside it. This time, its brake lights were on.",24,46
1puc5kb,,"After another hour of driving, an hour that felt like an eternity, I could finally see the gas station ahead. It appeared faint in the distance, surrounded by fog.",29,47
1puc5kb,,"If it weren’t for the red lights of the truck standing near it, I might not have noticed it at all.",21,48
1puc5kb,,"Right upon touching the gas station’s boundary, there was no need for me to stop the truck. It stopped on its own.",22,49
1puc5kb,,"The gas station’s image vanished from the rear-view mirror, confirming that the mirror didn’t show what was behind me, it showed what was waiting. I looked at the hitchhiker.",29,50
1puc5kb,,"He was still staring ahead, as if waiting for me to move first.",13,51
1puc5kb,,"I took out a cigarette, not out of craving, but because I needed something familiar, something ordinary, to anchor myself to reality. I lit it. The smoke didn’t drift.",29,52
1puc5kb,,"It remained static, suspended in place. Then the hitchhiker moved. His body resisted itself, as though something unseen dictated how far and how fast he was allowed to go.",29,53
1puc5kb,,"He snatched the cigarette from my hand. The gesture stirred something in me, an echo of familiarity I couldn’t place.",20,54
1puc5kb,,"I knew I had seen that movement before, but the memory refused to surface, leaving behind only unease.",18,55
1puc5kb,,"He stepped out and began running towards the truck parked at the other end of the gas station, the cigarette still in his hand.",24,56
1puc5kb,,"Immediately, another truck came hurling out of the darkness. The hitchhiker tried to make way, but at an impossible speed, the truck struck him.",24,57
1puc5kb,,"He was thrown upwards, still rotating slowly in the air, suspended rather than falling.",14,58
1puc5kb,,"A powerful hum followed, one that lingered far longer than it should have, vibrating through my bones. The truck vanished into the darkness as abruptly as it had appeared.",29,59
1puc5kb,,"The body did not fall. It remained floating, rotating gently, as if held there by the same force that governed the road. I walked towards the parked truck.",28,60
1puc5kb,,"The moment I climbed inside, I didn’t need to see anything else. The scent told me everything. It was Martin’s truck. My legs weakened before the thought fully formed.",29,61
1puc5kb,,"Only then did the realization hit me, the hitchhiker had been Martin all along. Tears rolled down my face as his body still hovered above, unreachable.",26,62
1puc5kb,,"I didn’t know what to do. I couldn’t understand why Martin hadn’t spoken, or why he never looked at me.",20,63
1puc5kb,,"I didn’t understand the hum, or whether it had been him, or the road, or both. The next moment, I looked into the rear-view mirror of Martin’s truck.",28,64
1puc5kb,,"It showed a truck speeding towards me. And I understood, with a certainty that made my chest tighten, that the road was not finished with me yet. [Part Three](",29,65
1pubtad,I Snooped on My Roommate’s Computer. I Wish I'd Found Nothing.,"I know how this sounds, but I swear I had a reason. Every once in a while, when my roommate Conner wasn’t home, I’d check his room.",27,0
1pubtad,,I didn’t do this to steal anything or be a snoop for the sake of it.,16,1
1pubtad,,"No, I wanted to reassure myself that I wasn’t living with someone who’d eventually end up on the news. Conner isn’t a regular guy.",24,2
1pubtad,,He’s a little too proud of his German heritage if you know what I mean. The kind of pride that sneaks into places where it doesn’t belong.,27,3
1pubtad,,"Nazi jokes that land wrong. WW2 Facts nobody asked for. He says them casually, like he’s just sharing trivia, but he always watches your face afterward. Always checking for judgment.",30,4
1pubtad,,"To make matters worse, he’s obsessed with guns and knives. He collects them. Displays them. Lines them up on his wall like achievements.",23,5
1pubtad,,"There’s a twisted dagger mounted above his TV that he once called “a real beauty,” and I remember wondering why anyone would need something shaped like that unless they’d spent time imagining what it would feel like to use it.",40,6
1pubtad,,His room puts out bad vibes beyond just the murder weapons.,11,7
1pubtad,,"Between morbid heavy metal posters for bands no one has heard of and the two movie posters he has up (American Psycho and Joker by the way), there were lots and lots of old war memorabilia that seems to always happen to be German.",44,8
1pubtad,,No Old US Army helmets or Red Army ushankas. He only had the stuff his favorites used.,17,9
1pubtad,,"That included a WWII gas mask hanging on the wall, stiff and yellowed from prior use.",16,10
1pubtad,,He fucking loved that thing and would wear it at night to freak me out.,15,11
1pubtad,,"So yeah, I consider it my civic duty to search his room from time to time. Not because I’m nosy.",20,12
1pubtad,,"Because when someone surrounds themselves with weapons, Nazi iconography, and incel shit, you start wondering if they’re ever going to act out one of their special interests.",27,13
1pubtad,,I sat at his desk and logged into his computer. His password was his favorite movie plus the same numbers he used for everything.,24,14
1pubtad,,"The numbers 12, 13, and 14, no idea the meaning behind those, but he uses them for everything: usernames, gamer tags, passcodes.",22,15
1pubtad,,"His over use of them, made guessing his password a lot easier that’s for sure. The browser that opened upon logging in wasn’t Chrome. It was a Tor browser.",29,16
1pubtad,,"Conner loved talking about the “deep web” or the “dark web.” Always said it with a grin, like he knew something about it everyone else didn’t.",26,17
1pubtad,,"At first, it almost felt stupid. Drugs. Weapons. Things so blatant they felt fake. I even laughed at one site offering hired killers like it was an online food menu.",30,18
1pubtad,,It seemed my fears of Conner were unfounded. He was just using the dark web to cosplay being a criminal. None of this shit was real.,26,19
1pubtad,,I was about to get off when I noticed a message pop up on Conner’s computer through the open door. A chat app I didn’t recognize.,26,20
1pubtad,,The sender name was just a single letter. X. Curiosity won. It always does. The messages assumed I was Conner. X joked with him about always working during the matinees.,30,21
1pubtad,,X even mocked him for being sloppy and not using his ghost??? Whatever the hell that meant.,17,22
1pubtad,,"When I replied, pretending to be sick and home from work, the response came almost instantly. They sent a link. They called it a Red Room.",26,23
1pubtad,,"I knew what that was, but I told myself it wasn’t real. The FBI  says they aren’t, so I clicked anyway. The screen went dark, then bright red.",28,24
1pubtad,,Like a theater curtain pulling back. The chat exploded with emojis. Popcorn. Eyes. Smiley faces. It was like a demented twitch chat. Then the stream started.,26,25
1pubtad,,"There was a young woman on screen, tied up and terrified. The first bid was for her to get one of her fingers cut off and fed to her.",29,26
1pubtad,,I laughed at first.,4,27
1pubtad,,"I actually fucking laughed thinking it was all bullshit, but then a man in a hockey mask stepped into frame with a knife not all that disimilar to the ones Conner had hanging on his wall.",36,28
1pubtad,,The man in the hockey mask cut her finger off like it was a piece of meat at the deli.,20,29
1pubtad,,As she screamed he shoved it down her throat and she vomited it back out.,15,30
1pubtad,,"So, he tried to feed it to her again, but this time she kept her mouth shut, so he grabbed her by the nose and squeezed until it started gushing blood.",31,31
1pubtad,,"That got her to scream again and after three of the worst minutes of my life, the man in the hockey mask got her to eat the finger.",28,32
1pubtad,,I won’t repeat the other bids. I won’t repeat what people were asking to be done to her or how casually they typed it.,24,33
1pubtad,,"I just remember realizing, in a cold, quiet moment, that Conner had more points saved up than I’d seen spent so far and people were spending a lot.",28,34
1pubtad,,"I muted the audio and nearly threw up. I ran to my laptop and considered calling the police, but I doubted that would be any good.",26,35
1pubtad,,"They’d think I was making this shit up, so instead I tried reporting the site through the FBI’s cybercrimes division.",20,36
1pubtad,,"When I went back to Conner’s room to grab the pertinent site information, a private message popped up. “I wouldn’t do that.” X said.",24,37
1pubtad,,"I tried to ignore it until X added, “Ed…” That’s my name. I considered what to do next. How could X know it was me and not Conner?",28,38
1pubtad,,"How the fuck does he even know who I am? Did Conner tell them about me? “Do what?” I replied, curiosity getting the better of me.",26,39
1pubtad,,"“Report the site like you’re trying to do right now. It won’t work Ed.”

“Why not?” I replied again, taking pictures of the conversation with my phone. “Nice try.",29,40
1pubtad,,"I’m in your phone too.” X replied, not in the chat this time, but through my phone’s messenger app.",19,41
1pubtad,,"“You still can’t stop me.” I texted them back, hoping that taunting them would get them to overplay their hand.",20,42
1pubtad,,"That’s when X replied back with my full name, home address, credit card number, and the names and addresses of my parents and sister.",24,43
1pubtad,,X told me the site would be gone before anyone found it. That I’d sound crazy. Then they said something worse.,21,44
1pubtad,,"“You don’t want to be in the next show, do you?”

They told me to place a bid. Not to save her. But to participate and implicate myself too.",29,45
1pubtad,,"“All you gotta do is have him cut her…that’s all.” X explained. When I put in the bid, my hands were shaking so badly I almost missed the enter key.",30,46
1pubtad,,"I didn’t even look at the number afterward. I just stared at the screen, waiting for something to stop me. An error. A disconnect. Anything. The chat froze.",28,47
1pubtad,,Then it exploded. Question marks. Laughing faces. People typing things like *what?* and *is this a joke?* Someone accused me of wasting points. Someone else said it was boring.,29,48
1pubtad,,"I felt this thin, stupid flicker of hope rise in my chest. Like maybe confusion was enough. Like maybe nonsense could derail this death machine.",25,49
1pubtad,,"On the stream, the man in the hockey mask tilted his head. He looked genuinely curious. He set the knife down.",21,50
1pubtad,,I didn’t breathe until I saw his hand come back into frame holding an electric razor. The sound was what broke me. That low mechanical buzz cutting through the silence.,30,51
1pubtad,,"The girl started crying immediately, like she already knew what was coming, like humiliation hurt almost as much as everything else.",21,52
1pubtad,,"She tried to turn her head away, but she couldn’t go anywhere. Hair fell into her lap in uneven clumps. The chat went quiet again. Not angry this time. Watching.",30,53
1pubtad,,"I felt sick, but I also felt something worse. Relief. A coward’s relief. I told myself I’d done something. That I’d changed the outcome. That this was better.",28,54
1pubtad,,Then the applause started. Clapping emojis. Fire. People calling it “bold.” “Avant-garde.” Someone typed that it was poetic. That stripping her identity was more interesting than hurting her body.,29,55
1pubtad,,I wanted to scream at them that they were all insane. That this wasn’t art. That this wasn’t even mercy.,20,56
1pubtad,,It was a thin attempt to appease X without it weighing too heavy on my conscience. A private message popped up.,21,57
1pubtad,,"“Well done.”

Before I could even process that, another bid appeared. Bigger than mine. Bigger than anything I’d seen all night.",21,58
1pubtad,,"The man in the mask stepped back so the camera could see her clearly. Her ruined hair. Her shaking shoulders. Her empty, exhausted eyes. He grabbed a machete.",28,59
1pubtad,,"I knew what was coming before it happened. I muted the audio, but it didn’t help.",16,60
1pubtad,,"Her now exposed scalp erupted red as she was cleaved to death with the machete. I think somewhere between the fifth and sixth swing, she died.",26,61
1pubtad,,"At least I hope she did. When he was done, The man in the hockey mask left the machete in her skull much to the sick delight of the chat.",30,62
1pubtad,,"The stream ended shortly after. I cried until my chest hurt. I prayed that was the end… The horrible sickening end…

It wasn’t. X  messaged me again.",27,63
1pubtad,,Said I had one more task to complete to prove they could trust me.,14,64
1pubtad,,"Said unlike the last one, it would be “fun.”

When I read X’s final task, I couldn’t help but look up from the computer screen and towards Conner’s wall.",29,65
1pubtad,,"The gas mask and the knife were both staring back at me. “You know what to do.” X said. That night, Conner came home like nothing was wrong. Headphones on.",30,66
1pubtad,,"Heavy metal Music blasting. He barely looked at me as I watched TV in the living room. Later, from my room, I heard him settle in.",26,67
1pubtad,,"The familiar clicks of his keyboard. The same browser opening. The hum of his music, still blasting in his ears. Another message arrived for him.",25,68
1pubtad,,I saw it reflected faintly off the window as I stood behind his door. “Ready for the show?” It was from X.,22,69
1pubtad,,"I picked up the knife on the wall behind Conner as he typed his response. “Always.” Conner replied. When the stream loaded, Conner didn’t understand.",25,70

1pubt7l,,My mom shrugged and said maybe Santa got lost. I didn’t cry or throw a tantrum. I just promised myself I’d be extra good next year.,26,4
1pubt7l,,I cleaned my room obsessively. Helped my little sister with her homework like a saint. Didn’t bully a single kid for months.,22,5

1pubt7l,,"That Christmas night I wrote my own list. Much shorter than his. A lot more personal. It only had one name:

1. The Fat Red Bastard.",26,8

1pubt7l,,"Abandoned factories, a dead wreath hanging from a rusted fence, one light still flickering in Toy Assembly Line B.",19,14
1pubt7l,,I walked those halls like a detective investigating a crime scene where the crime was emotional neglect and the perpetrator wore red velvet.,23,15

I stared at that address for a long time.",30,22

1pubt7l,,I walked through the neon haze of the Strip and took the elevator to the sixth floor. Room 611 reeked of cigar smoke and cheap peppermint air freshener.,28,24

“You owe me, you old fuck,” I snapped. He let out a dry, hollow laugh. “Ah, nostalgia.” He took a slow drag from his Montecristo cigar.",30,27

He wasn’t the original Santa. He’d been a kid who never got anything either.",23,28

Inside were the deeds to the factories, workshop blueprints, sleigh schematics, and a business card that read: CEO – Claus Inc. For a moment I was twelve again.",30,32
1pubt7l,,"Lying in bed, heart pounding, dreaming of a gift that never came. Maybe this was my chance. Maybe I could become the Santa I never had.",26,33
1pubt7l,,Make sure no kid ever felt as invisible as I did. But then I remembered every empty morning. Every forced smile that vanished in January.,25,34
1pubt7l,,"That night I picked up the phone and called Disney. I sold the whole damn thing. Factories, lore, sleigh, even the elf labor rights. Three hundred billion a year. Forever.",30,35
1pubt7l,,I bought a penthouse in Calabasas and a rice cooker that plays jazz when it finishes. I sleep like a baby in Armani sheets surrounded by Egyptian cotton.,28,36

1pubt7l,,"So hate me if you want. It’s Anti-Christmas now. Forever. And hey. If you want in, there’s still some Anti-Christmas Squad merch available. Proceeds go straight to my bank account.",30,39

1pubn83,,"I looked down at my other hand, noticing that it was caught in the same way.",16,8
1pubn83,,"As my vision sharpened, the blurry shapes resolved, and the realization hit me, sending a fresh surge of panic through my already tattered mind.",24,9
1pubn83,,My wrists were shackled with heavy chains.,7,10

1pubn83,,"With each attempt, the unforgiving metal bit down, tearing off strips of skin, leaving thin streams of blood trailing down the brick and onto the cold concrete floor.",28,13
1pubn83,,"I eventually stopped fighting, letting the chains go slack as I tried to conserve what little energy I had left.",20,14
1pubn83,,"I rested my head against the cold brick, feeling the adrenaline drain away and my senses creeping back one by one. That’s when the smell hit me.",27,15

1pubn83,,"My eyes snapped back to the door as adrenaline-soaked panic tore through me, raising every hair on my skin. I couldn’t see him yet, but I could feel him.",29,30
1pubn83,,"A dark, foreboding presence pressed in closer with each echoing step. I barely had time to sit up before the door creaked open and he stepped into the room.",29,31
1pubn83,,"My skin crawled the moment I saw him, his face still wearing that same sick, curling smile.",17,32
1pubn83,,"His clothes were the same, ragged and stained, but his eyes were sharper now, bright with what looked like an eager anticipation, like he’d been waiting for this particular moment his entire life.",33,33
1pubn83,,"His gaze slowly rolled over me, assessing his prize. Seemingly satisfied with what he saw, he spoke. ""Good.",18,34
1pubn83,,"You're awake,"" he said, his voice relaxed and calm, as if this were a completely normal conversation. ""I was starting to worry you wouldn’t wake up.",26,35
1pubn83,,"But you seemed like a tough one. I figured you’d come around. You’ve got some fight in you, Emily.",19,36
1pubn83,,"I like that in a woman.""

Hearing my name slide off his lips made me want to vomit. He had taken everything from me, including my name.",27,37
1pubn83,,"I wanted to curse, fight, anything, but I couldn’t. My mouth was so dry that it had tightened my throat, preventing my vocal cords from functioning.",26,38

1pubn83,,"I could do nothing but glare at him, my words stuck somewhere between my mind and my mouth.",18,40
1pubn83,,"""Don’t bother struggling,” he said, looking down at me, like he could read my thoughts. “You’re not going anywhere.",19,41
1pubn83,,"Not yet anyhow.”

He reached into his pocket and pulled out a small knife, holding it up in front of me to make sure I saw it.",27,42
1pubn83,,"My breath caught in my throat as he took a step closer. The dim light skimmed across the blade, sending a sharp pain through my head.",26,43
1pubn83,,"It wasn’t large, but he handled it with such casual ease that my whole body trembled in fear. He twirled it between his fingers effortlessly, like a familiar toy.",29,44
1pubn83,,"I could feel the intensity grow in the room with every movement. “You see, Emily,” he continued, his voice low and smooth, “I don’t really like to hurt people.",29,45
1pubn83,,"But when they don’t listen, and especially when they’re difficult, they need to be put back in line.",18,46
1pubn83,,"Understand?”

He stepped closer, then crouched down until his eyes were level with mine.",14,47
1pubn83,,"My heart hammered in my chest as I instinctively pulled against the chains, trying to push myself as far away from him as I could get.",26,48
1pubn83,,"‘Please,’ I silently begged in my mind, ‘Please, no.’

I wanted to shout, but the words stayed locked inside me. I was completely trapped.",24,49
1pubn83,,"His smile widened as he lowered the blade from my face. “I’m going to be kind to you. I promise I am,” he said, staring into my eyes.",28,50
1pubn83,,“But you’re going to need to learn.,7,51
1pubn83,,"You’re going to have to understand how things work around here.”

I flinched as he suddenly rose, his fingers grazing my cheek on the way up.",26,52
1pubn83,,"It was the gentlest touch, but in my mind, it felt like a razor blade dragging across my skin. My body screamed to pull away, but I could barely move.",30,53
1pubn83,,"He reached out and cupped my jaw, forcing my head to tilt upward. His face hovered inches from mine, so close that I could see every detail in his face.",30,54
1pubn83,,"His skin, so sickly pale, looked as if it had been completely drained of all warmth.",16,55
1pubn83,,"Thin, purple veins snaked across his temples and neck, pulsing subtly as if some alien fluid flowed through them.",19,56
1pubn83,,"Worst of all, his cracked, colorless lips twisted upward into that same grotesque, misshapen smile, sending waves of nausea across my stomach.",22,57
1pubn83,,"Though I badly wanted to, I dared not look away. I was frozen in terror, forced to stare into his soulless eyes. He pulled back slightly, grinning with amusement.",29,58
1pubn83,,"“I don’t hurt the ones who make it easy,” he said softly. “But when they make it hard...",18,59
1pubn83,,"well, that just makes it a little more fun for me.”

I felt my stomach twist as his words slithered around my mind like a parasite, digging in to feed on my fear.",33,60
1pubn83,,"The knife in his hand caught the dim light, glinting sharply across my face, a cold, silent reminder of what would happen if I didn’t obey. Suddenly, he lunged forward.",30,61
1pubn83,,"I barely had time to register his movement before a hot, searing pain ripped across my cheek. The blade sank in, carving a line of fire through my skin.",29,62
1pubn83,,"I could feel the warm blood beginning to flow across my cheek in thick, sticky rivulets, slowly rolling down my neck and onto my shirt.",25,63
1pubn83,,"I gasped, my eyes wide in shock.",7,64
1pubn83,,"He was just there, the blade slicing through my skin so fast, so effortlessly that I couldn’t have stopped it if I wanted to.",24,65
1pubn83,,"Blood pooled in my mouth, thick and metallic as it flowed down my face.",14,66
1pubn83,,"I summoned everything within me to keep from gagging, fighting to stay calm and bury the pain. I didn’t want to give him the satisfaction of seeing me break.",29,67
1pubn83,,"Smiling widely, he stepped back to admire his handiwork. “See? That wasn’t so bad, was it?” he asked sarcastically. “It’s just a little cut. It’ll heal.",26,68
1pubn83,,"In a few days, you won’t even remember it.”

He was right. The sharp, throbbing pain in my cheek was already fading beneath something far worse.",26,69
1pubn83,,The creeping realization that this was only the beginning settled heavily in my mind.,14,70
1pubn83,,"If this was ‘not so bad,’ I couldn’t begin to imagine what he would do to someone who made it ‘difficult.’

“Now,” he said, looking down at the blood on his fingers, “let’s see how long it takes for you to learn.”

He casually pulled out a white handkerchief from his pocket and began wiping my blood from his blade and hands before tucking it away again.",67,71
1pubn83,,"I wanted to scream or to fight, but I couldn’t. It wouldn’t do any good anyway.",16,72
1pubn83,,"The chains were too tight, and my body was already trembling too hard to be of any use to me. Sheer and absolute terror rooted me in place.",28,73
1pubn83,,"“Please,” I whispered, my voice crackling and weak. “Please don’t do this to me.”

He stood there, motionless, staring at me with those cold, empty eyes.",26,74
1pubn83,,"For a moment, maybe a fraction of a second, I thought I saw something shift behind them. I noticed the slightest flicker of humanity spark within him.",27,75
1pubn83,,"But just as quickly as it had shown, it vanished, swallowed by the vast, empty darkness he had become.",19,76
1pubn83,,"“I’m going to take good care of you, Emily,” he said, his voice soft once again.",16,77
1pubn83,,"“You just need to learn your place, and it will all be fine.”

It sounded gentle, but I could hear the darkness behind it, the threat buried underneath.",28,78
1pubn83,,I now knew what he was capable of. I’d seen the way his eyes darkened the moment the knife appeared.,20,79
1pubn83,,"I saw the way he looked at me, not like a person, but like a thing, something to be broken. Twisted. Owned.",22,80

No sooner had we gotten back on the road, than the few flakes had turned into heavy, but direct snowfall.",27,21
1pu7589,,"Though the roads had been cleared a couple of days prior, it wouldn’t take long for the asphalt to turn into a slippery mess.",24,22
1pu7589,,"Still, we kept pushing, knowing better than to let ourselves get snowed in here in the middle of nowhere.",19,23
1pu7589,,"The wind picked up, shooting white specs of snow towards our windshield, lowing our visibility to near zero. We slowed down, desperately trying to keep the road in sight.",29,24
1pu7589,,"Minutes passed, and the path ahead quickly faded away into a white sheet, we were left no choice but to slow down to a crawl.",25,25
1pu7589,,"Even then, we’d hit the edge of the road, barely able to swerve back onto the slippery asphalt. “We should stop,” I begged.",23,26
1pu7589,,"“If we stop here, we ain’t going to be able to get moving again,” my dad argued.",17,27
1pu7589,,"But it wouldn’t matter, because before we could get a chance to argue about our predicament, we came to a gliding halt as the snow ahead had piled up to levels far exceeding what our car could traverse.",38,28
1pu7589,,"“Fuck!” my dad yelled out of frustration before quickly catching himself. “Sorry, didn’t mean to say that.”

But the damage had already been done.",24,29
1pu7589,,My dad was a stoic man never resorting to profanity unless reaching his absolute limit.,15,30
1pu7589,,"With a single word, he’d let it slip that he was no longer in control, and that fact terrified me more than anything that could have happened on the road.",30,31
1pu7589,,"“We should turn around,” I suggested, worry clearly present in my voice. “It’s no use. The roads aren’t going to get better in the other direction either.",27,32
1pu7589,,"We’re in too deep.”

He pulled his cellphone out of the glove compartment and turned it on a hopeless effort at calling for help, but this far away from the nearest city we were out of luck.",37,33
1pu7589,,"There wasn’t a single bar of signal to reach civilization. “What are we going to do?” I asked. “It’s going to be alright,” he said as reassuringly as he could.",30,34
1pu7589,,"“Your grandparents know we’re coming. Once they realize we’re not there, they’ll know we’re stuck on the road.",18,35
1pu7589,,"They’ll send someone, I’m sure of it.”

“How do you know?” I asked not demanding an explanation, but further reassurance.",20,36
1pu7589,,"“Trust me, I’ve known your grandparents a lot longer than you have. We’ll be fine as long we make it through the night.",23,37
1pu7589,,"But it’s going to be cold, so I’m going to need you to get dressed, alright?”

His trademark confidence calmed me down a little.",24,38
1pu7589,,"After all the stories he’d told me about the perils he’d endured, surely, he’d know how to keep us safe.",20,39
1pu7589,,I did as my dad had ordered and put on several layers of clothes taken out of my suitcase in the trunk.,22,40
1pu7589,,"Though we had little in terms of supplies, there were enough snacks back there to keep us satiated through the night.",21,41
1pu7589,,"I dug through the luggage, the presents for my grandparents, and carefully put aside my dad’s prized hunting rifle. “Don’t worry.",21,42
1pu7589,,"If we get stuck here for more than a day, I’ll go hunt something for us to eat,” he joked, “but we’re going to be out of here by tomorrow.",30,43
1pu7589,,"We just have to stay put until someone comes to get us.”

We turned the car off, still kept warm by the residual heat that dissipated minute by minute.",29,44
1pu7589,,"Even our presence within the car cabin alone kept the heat trapped inside, if only for a short time.",19,45
1pu7589,,"I tried to sleep, hoping that the roads would clear up during my slumber, allowing me to wake up in a completely new location as I had first anticipated.",29,46
1pu7589,,"My dad, stubborn as he was, would stay awake, intermittently checking his phone in case a signal could get through.",20,47
1pu7589,,"Whenever the temperature dropped too low and I so much as shivered, he´d restart the engine just for long enough to heat up the car, keeping a close look at the fuel gauge.",33,48
1pu7589,,"Despite our troubling predicament, I once again felt safe in his presence, enough so that I managed to fall into a deep sleep full of bizarre dreams about forest giants and snow trolls, triggered by the sounds of howling wind and snow pounding against our car.",46,49
1pu7589,,I awoke again to my dad opening the driver´s seat door to get outside.,14,50
1pu7589,,"He turned to me, shovel in hand, “stay put, I´m just going to clear the exhaust pipe,” he explained.",19,51
1pu7589,,"The door had only been open for all of seven seconds, but it had been enough to drastically drop the temperature inside.",22,52
1pu7589,,"He held up a flashlight to assess our situation, its beam prominently displayed by the incessant snow fall, though only able to penetrate it for all of five feet.",29,53
1pu7589,,"He got to work slowly clearing the exhaust pipe of snow, stopping us from getting suffocated by the carbon monoxide gas, but it wouldn´t clear the road, and within a couple of hours, he´d have to clear the way again.",40,54
1pu7589,,"He then cleared a narrow path between the growing layer of snow and the passenger seat door, allowing both of us to quickly get out of the car in case we needed to leave.",34,55
1pu7589,,"Once the job had been done, he got back into the car and started the engine to once again heat up the interior.",23,56
1pu7589,,"His hands shivered from the cold, and he looked worried, though he´d never admit to such.",16,57
1pu7589,,He again ordered me to try to get some rest while he stayed awake to make sure that we wouldn´t get buried in the snow.,25,58
1pu7589,,"Again, I fell to slumber, though it had turned to an uneasy once as I had started to notice that even my dad might not be equipped to keep us safe overnight.",32,59
1pu7589,,Then the door opened once more.,6,60
1pu7589,,"Only an hour had passed that time, and yet again my dad needed to get out to clear the exhaust pipe, car roof, and doors.",25,61
1pu7589,,"It took more time then, both due to exhaustion and due to worsening weather conditions.",15,62
1pu7589,,"I kept my eyes and ears peeled, praying silently that someone might already come to our rescue. The road ahead, now completely invisible under the snow, remained dark.",28,63
1pu7589,,"The howling wind had picked up, and apart from the scraping of my dad´s shovel and thumps of tossed snow, there was nothing else to be heard.",27,64
1pu7589,,"But then we heard something. Faint at first, barely cutting through the storm, but definitely a contrast to the monotonous cacophony we´d suffered under so far.",26,65
1pu7589,,"I contemplated opening my door to get a better listen, but before I could make that decision, my dad jumped back into the car and told me to stay quiet.",30,66
1pu7589,,He looked pale as a sheet. It wasn´t just from the cold; there was something else subtly present in his eyes: utter terror.,23,67
1pu7589,,"“What was that—”

“Quiet!” he whispered aggressively without explaining what he´d heard. I froze in place; my eyes fixed on the storm before us.",24,68
1pu7589,,"My heart pounded, but I kept focused, trying to hear the sound again. “Please, help me!” a desperate voice called out through the storm, impossibly loud.",26,69
1pu7589,,"But it differed from the sound I’d heard before. Though I couldn’t precisely place it, I knew it hadn’t been a voice.",22,70
1pu7589,,"It once again prompted my dad to get out of the vehicle, his fear turned to determination to save whoever else might be trapped in the storm with us.",29,71
1pu7589,,"“Hello, is there anyone out there?” he called as he waves his flashlight back and forth as if to signal any lost souls on the road.",26,72
1pu7589,,"“Stop it, please!” the voice called out, getting even closer. That time it sounded different, like it had come from a different person.",23,73
1pu7589,,"It was distorted by the storm, making it impossible to decern whether it came from a man or woman. “Where are you?” dad called out again.",26,74
1pu7589,,"“Help me!” the voice repeated, not acknowledging our presence, sounding even stranger than it had before. “I can´t see you.",20,75
1pu7589,,"Just follow the light!” he went on, still waving his flashlight around. “Oh, God, no!” the voice went on, even closer then.",22,76
1pu7589,,"Something was wrong, though I couldn´t explain what, I could feel it deep inside me.",15,77
1pu7589,,"Whatever had called for help had awoken a primal instinct within me, one I hadn´t felt that far during my eleven years of life, and it was telling me to run.",31,78
1pu7589,,"“Dad, get back in the car!” I pleaded, but he had stepped too far away from the car. He couldn´t hear me.",22,79
1pu7589,,"I opened the passenger side door and stepped outside, calling for my dad once more. In the distance I could just barely see his flashlight waving through the air.",29,80
1pu7589,,"“Help me!” the voice called outside, jarring and unnaturally loud. It didn´t even attempt to sound human anymore. “Over here!” my dad responded.",23,81
1pu7589,,"“Dad, come back!”

Then, as if a switch had been flicked, the pleas for help turned to a relentless, ear-shattering scream.",21,82
1pu7589,,"It sounded as if it came from above us, from something too tall to ever be considered human. I cried out for my dad once more, but he didn´t respond.",30,83
1pu7589,,"“Dad, please!” I begged. The beam of his flashlight hung still in the air for a moment, before suddenly starting to spin as if the flashlight had been tossed.",29,84
1pu7589,,"Worried that my dad might have been taken by the creature, I prepared to set off and chase after him, but no sooner had I taken one step into the darkness than something pulled me back into the car.",39,85
1pu7589,,"“Close the door!” my dad ordered. I did as commanded and closed and locked the door. “What happened?”

“Shh!”

Using his hands, he gestured for me to stay low.",29,86
1pu7589,,"He turned off the headlights and everything inside the car, plunging us into absolute darkness. We lay there for minutes, listening intently for signs of life outside.",27,87
1pu7589,,"Once I just started to believe that the coast might be clear, the silence was shattered by another guttural scream that sent shivers down my spine.",26,88
1pu7589,,"I dug myself deeper into the seat, hoping it might somehow keep me safe from whichever horrors were to come, but against all odds, whatever lurked outside didn´t seem to know where we were.",34,89
1pu7589,,“What is it?” I whispered.,5,90
1pu7589,,"“I don´t know,” my dad whispered back, “just try to stay quiet.”  

The interior of the car remained completely dark except for a small digital clock on the dashboard that stated that we´d just made it past three in the morning.",41,91
1pu7589,,"Even if we survived until the break of day, it would take hours for anyone to realize we were gone much less find us, and attempting to flee on foot would undoubtedly lead to our deaths either by the environment or by the monster outside.",45,92
1pu7589,,"With no other option, we remained hidden inside the car, counting the minutes as the snow continued to bury us.",20,93
1pu7589,,"Unable to use the car´s engine to heat up the car lest we alert the monster, the temperature slowly sank to below zero.",23,94
1pu7589,,"Even if we weren´t found by the monster, we might not survive the cold.",14,95
1pu7589,,"My dad wrapped his arms around me in an attempt at keeping me warm, but at that point I doubted he could feel his arms anymore.",26,96
1pu7589,,"“It’s going to be okay, Matty.",6,97
1pu7589,,"I promise,” he whispered, “I’ll get us out of here.”

The screaming persisted throughout the next couple of hours, getting closer at first, but always going in the wrong direction, circling us again and again.",35,98
1pu7589,,"At that point, our car was covered in a layer of snow deep enough so that the monster could only find us if he stepped directly on top of us.",30,99
1pu7589,,"As the morning hours neared, the storm also appeared to have calmed, but the temperature’s had dropped to depths cold enough that should we fall asleep, we might not wake up again.",32,100
1pu7589,,"Despite the fear I felt, my body was about to shut down. No matter how much I tried to fight it, I was just lingering on the brink of consciousness.",30,101
1pu7589,,"“Hey, Matty, stay awake,” my dad whispered as he shook me. “I’m so cold,” I stuttered in an exhausted response.",20,102
1pu7589,,"Another scream could be heard in the distance, a bit further away that time. This was the only chance we would get.",22,103
1pu7589,,"If we didn’t act fast, the cold would kill us before the monster did.",14,104
1pu7589,,"“We’re going to have to warm up the car, but I need to clear the exhaust pipe again, okay?”

With both doors trapped behind piles of snow, my dad opted to crawl to the back of the car, guided only by the lights of the dimmest of curtesy lamps, and open the trunk from inside.",55,105
1pu7589,,"Since it would open upwards, he might be able to get enough leverage to push it against the snow covering the top.",22,106
1pu7589,,"He crawled over the suitcases, holding onto the shovel. He then paused for a moment, his gaze lingering on the hunting rifle.",22,107
1pu7589,,"Not knowing what we were up against, we had no way of knowing the rifle would be powerful enough to serve as means of defense, but should it come to a direct confrontation, we didn’t have any other viable options.",40,108
1pu7589,,He loaded the rifle while lying flat inside the car and put it to the side for easy access as he pushed the trunk open.,25,109
1pu7589,,He then proceeded to dig out as much snow as he could without standing up tall enough to be discovered by the creature.,23,110
1pu7589,,"Once the exhaust had been cleared, he grabbed onto the rifle and signaled for me to turn on the engine.",20,111
1pu7589,,"The lights had already been turned to their “off” position, but even though the car wouldn’t light up significantly, the engine would still make a sound.",26,112
1pu7589,,"The engine whirred to life, but rather than climb back inside, my dad remained outside, rifle in hand.",18,113
1pu7589,,"In the dark he couldn’t possibly see the thing from a distance, meaning by the time he’d got it in his sight, it would most likely be too late to pull the trigger.",33,114
1pu7589,,"Seconds after turning on the car, a horrendous, continuous scream cut through the air, getting louder as the monster was rapidly approaching our location.",24,115
1pu7589,,"My dad fired a shot into the darkness, guided by nothing more than the sounds of the screaming.",18,116
1pu7589,,"He then fired again, and again, preparing to get off a fourth shot as something stepped onto the roof of our car, bending it inwards.",25,117
1pu7589,,"I dove down to avoid having my skull caved in, losing sight of my dad who had remained outside.",19,118
1pu7589,,He let out a pained yelp as his rifle fell to the ground with a soft thud.,17,119
1pu7589,,"As I lifted my head to get a peek at what was going on I could just see something wrapped around my dad’s legs, pulling him up into the air as his screams mixed with those of the tall creature.",40,120
1pu7589,,"I wanted to call out for him, but I knew better than to give away my position just to get taken like my dad.",24,121
1pu7589,,"So, I crawled through the damaged car in silence, attempting to reach for the rifle that had fallen into the snow.",21,122
1pu7589,,"Though I hadn’t ever been allowed to hold a firearm, I had been thoroughly lectured on its safety. I made it through the trunk, crawling outside into the snow.",29,123
1pu7589,,"The storm had subsided, and the skies had cleared, revealing a near full moon that cast a dim, white light upon the snowbound landscape.",24,124
1pu7589,,"Above the car stood the creature, holding my dad’s leg in one, twisted arm. It stood at least ten feet tall, its silhouette contrasting starkly against the night sky.",29,125
1pu7589,,"Antler-looking protrusions emerged from its shoulders, while its head appeared almost fused to its torso, its face indiscernible in the darkness.",21,126
1pu7589,,"It stuffed my dad’s leg into its mouth, closing down on it with teeth sharp enough to tare straight through the flesh.",22,127
1pu7589,,"Having no time left to lose, I picked the rifle up, pointed it in the creature’s general direction, and pulled the trigger.",22,128
1pu7589,,"A loud bang reverberated through the night, leaving me deaf for a moment. I found myself on the ground, having been shoved down by the rifle’s recoil.",27,129
1pu7589,,"The shot had hit the creature, distracting it enough to let my dad fall into a pile of snow, but it didn’t appear wounded.",24,130
1pu7589,,"All I had achieved was to redirect its attention to me, and I had nowhere left to run.",18,131
1pu7589,,"The creature gazed down at me, bending down close enough so that I could see its face reflected in the moonshine.",21,132
1pu7589,,"It had large, round eyes, pitch black and empty, and a large gash for a mouth filled with rough, pointed teeth that extended for rows upon rows inwards.",28,133
1pu7589,,"For a moment it just observed me, almost as if impressed with the fight I had put up.",18,134
1pu7589,,"“Matty!” I heard my dad yell, but it wasn’t enough to distract the creature from its next victim.",18,135
1pu7589,,"It began reaching out its hand, and I couldn’t even yell as my own life neared its sudden end.",19,136
1pu7589,,“Leave him alone!” my dad yelled as he rolled down from the pile of snow.,15,137
1pu7589,,"He grabbed onto the rifle, quickly cycled it before firing off another shot, this time hitting the creature directly in its eye.",22,138
1pu7589,,"The impact was enough to send it into a fit of agonizing rage, but the pain also distracted it for long enough to allow my dad to push me in under the car, before he himself climbed under it.",39,139
1pu7589,,"The creature, having lost sight of us, let out one final guttural scream, before leaving the car to search for us down the road, blinded in one eye and oblivious to our hiding spot directly under the car.",38,140
1pu7589,,"Only once we were sure it had left the area, did we climb back into the still running car, carefully closing the trunk.",23,141
1pu7589,,"The moon was about to set, giving way to a new day, but we weren’t safe yet.",17,142
1pu7589,,"A large chunk of my dad’s leg had been bitten off, and he was quickly losing blood.",17,143
1pu7589,,"He tried to use his own belt as a tourniquet, and though it slowed the bleeding, he needed immediate medical attention. “Someone will come,” he promised.",26,144
1pu7589,,"“How do you know?” I asked. “You just got to trust me on this one, you just have to hang in there.",22,145
1pu7589,,"You’ll be fine.”

“What about you?”

“I’m not going anywhere, I promise.”

But hours later no one had come, and my dad had fallen into a deep sleep from which I couldn’t wake him.",34,146
1pu7589,,"I lay my head on his chest and cried, knowing he’d soon be dead and there was nothing I could do to save him.",24,147
1pu7589,,"Then the engine came to a pathetic stall, leaving me alone in absolute silence. The first rays of sunshine dared peek over the horizon, dancing among the snow-covered trees.",29,148
1pu7589,,"If not for the horrors I’d endured, it would have been a beautiful morning.",14,149
1pu7589,,"Finally, I exited the car to see if the road would lead anywhere, but it all looked identical under the thick layer of snow.",24,150
1pu7589,,I wouldn’t know which way to take even had I had a map to guide the way.,17,151
1pu7589,,"In the distance, I could see something shifting among the trees, and a faint whirring sound approaching our car.",19,152
1pu7589,,"Five snowmobiles emerged from the tree line, having spotted me from afar. I jumped up and down and waved to them for help.",23,153
1pu7589,,"They were wearing bright orange outfits, with crosses on their backs.",11,154
1pu7589,,They immediately halted around our car and tended to my unconscious dad while one of them wrapped me in an orange heat shield.,23,155
1pu7589,,"He tried to ask me what had happened, but I was too deep in shock to respond.",17,156
1pu7589,,"All I could do was to look at them in shock while they loaded my dying father onto a stretcher, preparing to take him to a hospital.",27,157
1pu7589,,"Using what little I had left of my cognitive function, I tried to warn them about the monster we’d fought off, but it all emerged as an incomprehensible word salad.",30,158
1pu7589,,"They could respond by reassuring me that we were safe. But after all we’d seen, I wasn’t sure I could believe them.",22,159
1pu7589,,"\*\*\*

Next thing I recall was waking up in a hospital bed, unharmed if not for the mild hypothermia I’d suffered.",21,160
1pu7589,,"My grandmother sat by my bedside, sleeping in a chair. My dad was nowhere in sight. I cried for a moment, but she promised that everything would be fine.",29,161
1pu7589,,"She explained that my dad had been taken in for surgery, and that they would have to remove his leg, but that he’d be otherwise fine.",26,162
1pu7589,,"She asked me what had happened, but I wasn’t sure I wanted to tell her before my dad was there to support my story, worried she would think I had lost my mind.",33,163
1pu7589,,"She respected my wishes, reassuring me that I didn’t have to talk about anything until I felt ready. My only task was to focus on my recovery.",27,164
1pu7589,,"A couple of days later two men visited me in the hospital, casually dressed, but with strict expressions on their faces.",21,165
1pu7589,,"They introduced themselves, but I couldn’t take note of their names.",11,166
1pu7589,,"They asked me about what I’d seen in the snowstorm, but unlike my grandmother, they weren’t receptive to my refusal to talk without my dad present.",26,167
1pu7589,,"I told them about the creature, and though they weren’t happy about it, they didn’t try to refute my experience.",20,168
1pu7589,,"They only mentioned something about a “threshold event,” but didn’t elaborate any further.",13,169
1pu7589,,They explained to me that my dad needed to be taken in for further treatment at their own facility to rule out complications of the attack.,26,170
1pu7589,,"I asked to be taken with him, but they refused, citing “infection risk” as the reason for denial.",18,171
1pu7589,,"They tried to reassure me that they’d do everything they could to take care of my dad, but they didn’t come across it in a particularly genuine manner.",28,172
1pu7589,,"I was discharged from the hospital after five days of treatment and learned from my Grandparents that three other cars were stuck on the same road that night, only a few miles apart.",33,173
1pu7589,,"The passengers of those cars were never found. They were reported missing the following morning, but I already know that they won’t be found.",24,174
1pu7589,,"It would take another two months before I got to see my dad again, two months which I spent at my grandparents’ place.",23,175
1pu7589,,"When they finally let him go home, and though he was physically healthy apart from his missing leg, the mental toll had changed him.",24,176
1pu7589,,"He spent the rest of the winter weeks staring out the window into the snow, only calming down once spring had taken over and melted away the snow.",28,177
1pu7589,,Even then he refused to talk about what we’d been through.,11,178
1pu7589,,"Though he would acknowledge and confirm that the trauma we’d been through was real, he never dared go into detail.",20,179
1pu7589,,"\*\*\*

My dad died last year nineteen years after the event from unrelated illness.",14,180
1pu7589,,"He never truly got over the trauma of that night in December of 2005, nor have I, but surviving the memories without the only person that was there to go through them with me has shattered the little progress I’ve made.",41,181
1pu7589,,"The uncertainty of it all, and the lack of answers have left me unable to forget.",16,182
1pu7589,,"I’ll always remember my dad for the man he was, regardless of the events of that night.",17,183

1pu4sqt,,"It's a dead zone. No radio signal worth a damn, no cell service for a hundred miles in either direction.",20,8
1pu4sqt,,"It's the kind of place that makes you feel like you're the last person on Earth, a tiny capsule of light and noise moving through an infinite, silent void.",29,9
1pu4sqt,,"I'm usually pretty good with my fuel management. It's second nature after this long. But I'd been pushing it, trying to make up time I lost at the weigh station.",30,10

1pu4sqt,,"The low fuel light had been blinking patiently for the last twenty miles, a tiny orange beacon of my own stupidity.",21,12
1pu4sqt,,"I started doing the math, calculating mileage, and a cold sweat started to prickle my neck. Getting stranded out here wasn't just an inconvenience; it was dangerous.",27,13
1pu4sqt,,"Just as a genuine knot of panic began to tighten in my stomach, I saw it. Up ahead, a faint, sickly yellow glow, bleeding into the oppressive darkness.",28,14
1pu4sqt,,"It wasn't much, just a single light, but it was enough. As I got closer, the shape resolved itself.",19,15
1pu4sqt,,"A small, single-story building with a low, flat roof and a short awning over a pair of fuel pumps.",19,16
1pu4sqt,,"The sign was old, the kind with the plastic letters you can change by hand.",15,17
1pu4sqt,,"A few letters were missing, so it read something like ""_AS & _AT."" The light I’d seen was coming from a single, flickering fluorescent bulb under the awning, which cast long, dancing shadows and made the whole place look like it was underwater.",43,18
1pu4sqt,,"Everything about it screamed ‘keep driving.’ The paint was peeling off the walls in long strips, like sunburnt skin.",19,19
1pu4sqt,,"The pumps looked ancient, the kind with the rotating numbers instead of a digital display. The whole lot was cracked asphalt and weeds.",23,20
1pu4sqt,,"But my gauge was now defiantly sitting on empty, and beggars can't be choosers.",14,21
1pu4sqt,,"With a sigh that felt like it came from my boots, I geared down, the air brakes hissing in protest, and swung the big rig into the lot.",28,22
1pu4sqt,,The trailer tires crunched over loose gravel.,7,23
1pu4sqt,,"I killed the engine, and the sudden silence was deafening, broken only by the hum of the fluorescent light and the faint, frantic chirping of crickets.",26,24
1pu4sqt,,"I climbed down from the cab, my legs stiff. The air was cool and smelled of dust and distant rain.",20,25
1pu4sqt,,"Through the grimy plate-glass window of the station, I could see one person, a small figure standing behind a counter.",20,26
1pu4sqt,,"The bell above the door let out a weak, tinny jingle as I pushed it open.",16,27
1pu4sqt,,"The inside smelled of stale coffee, dust, and something else… something vaguely metallic and sweet, like old pennies. The shelves were mostly bare.",23,28
1pu4sqt,,"A few dusty cans of off-brand beans, a rack of sun-bleached chips, a cooler that hummed loudly but seemed to contain nothing but shadows.",24,29
1pu4sqt,,"The only person there was an old woman. She was tiny, almost bird-like, with a cloud of thin, white hair and a face that was a roadmap of wrinkles.",29,30
1pu4sqt,,"She wore a faded floral-print dress and a grey cardigan pulled tight around her shoulders, even though it wasn't cold inside.",21,31
1pu4sqt,,"The moment I stepped in, her head snapped up, and a wave of what I can only describe as profound relief washed over her features.",25,32
1pu4sqt,,"""Oh, thank heavens,"" she said, her voice thin and raspy, like dry leaves skittering across pavement. She put a trembling hand to her chest.",24,33
1pu4sqt,,"""You gave me a start, but I'm so glad to see you.",12,34
1pu4sqt,,"I get so nervous out here all by myself at night.""

I gave her what I hoped was a reassuring nod. ""No problem, ma'am.",24,35
1pu4sqt,,"Just need to fill up the tanks.""

""Of course, of course,"" she said, her eyes, which were surprisingly sharp and clear in her wrinkled face, darting to the window and back to me.",33,36
1pu4sqt,,"""It's just… the silence, you know? It gets so loud out here when you're all alone.""

I understood that. I really did.",22,37
1pu4sqt,,"The loneliness of the road is a character all its own. ""I hear you,"" I said, pulling out my company card.",21,38
1pu4sqt,,"""It's a long way between towns on this stretch.""

""Isn't it just,"" she breathed, her eyes fixed on me. ""A long, long way.",23,39
1pu4sqt,,"You headed east or west, dear?""

The question was normal enough. Gas station small talk. But the intensity in her gaze was a little off. ""East,"" I said.",28,40
1pu4sqt,,"""Got a load for the coast.""

""The coast,"" she repeated, almost dreamily. ""That's a good long drive. A real long drive.",21,41
1pu4sqt,,"You must get awfully tired.""

""Part of the job,"" I shrugged. I tapped the card on the counter.",18,42
1pu4sqt,,"""Can I prepay for, say, two hundred on pump one?""

She didn't move to take the card. She just kept looking at me, her head tilted slightly.",27,43
1pu4sqt,,"""Will you be stopping again soon? Before you get to the city?""

Okay, this was getting weird. ""Probably not.",19,44
1pu4sqt,,"Just want to get as many miles in as I can before sun-up.""

""So no one's really… expecting you?"" she asked, her voice dropping a little.",26,45
1pu4sqt,,"""No one's waiting for you at a motel or anything like that? You're just… out here.",16,46
1pu4sqt,,"On your own.""

The way she said ‘on your own’ sent a little shiver down my spine. It was a statement. An observation.",23,47
1pu4sqt,,"I felt a sudden, inexplicable urge to lie, to tell her my wife was waiting on the phone, that my dispatcher was tracking my every move.",26,48
1pu4sqt,,"But the words caught in my throat. I just wanted to get my fuel and go. ""That's right,"" I said, my voice a little tighter than I intended.",28,49
1pu4sqt,,"""Just me and the road. The pump, ma'am?""

She finally blinked, a slow, deliberate motion, and a thin smile stretched her lips. ""Of course, dear. My apologies.",27,50
1pu4sqt,,"My mind wanders."" She took the card and ran it through the ancient machine, her gnarled fingers moving with a slow, deliberate pace.",23,51
1pu4sqt,,"As the machine was processing, the tinny bell above the door jingled again. I turned. A man had entered.",19,52
1pu4sqt,,"He was tall and lean, with the kind of weathered, leathery skin you get from a life spent outdoors. He wore a dirty flannel shirt and worn-out jeans.",28,53
1pu4sqt,,"He didn't look at me, just let his eyes roam over the empty shelves, a strange, hungry look on his face.",21,54
1pu4sqt,,"He walked with a slight limp, his boots scuffing quietly on the linoleum floor.",14,55
1pu4sqt,,"He ambled up to the counter, standing a few feet away from me, and leaned in towards the old woman. He still didn't acknowledge my presence.",26,56
1pu4sqt,,"It was like I was a piece of furniture. ""Anything come in?"" he asked, his voice a low, gravelly rumble. The old woman's smile tightened.",25,57
1pu4sqt,,"She handed me my card back, but her eyes were on him. ""Not yet,"" she said, her voice now carrying a different tone. It was businesslike. Colder.",27,58
1pu4sqt,,"""Still waiting.""

The man grunted, sniffing the air.",8,59
1pu4sqt,,"""I'm getting hungry,"" he said, and turned his head and his eyes, dark and flat as river stones, flickered over me for a fraction of a second.",27,60
1pu4sqt,,"They were completely devoid of emotion. Then he looked back at the woman. ""Any fresh meat?""

My blood went cold. The phrase hung in the dusty air, thick and greasy.",30,61
1pu4sqt,,"It had to be a joke. Some kind of local slang. Maybe they sold deer jerky, or they were hunters. That had to be it.",25,62
1pu4sqt,,"My tired brain was making connections that weren't there. The old woman didn't miss a beat. She gave a tiny, almost imperceptible nod in my direction.",26,63
1pu4sqt,,"My back was mostly to her, but I saw it in the reflection on the grimy cooler door.",18,64
1pu4sqt,,"""There's fresh meat on the way,"" she said, her voice a low murmur.",13,65
1pu4sqt,,"""Just be patient.""

The man grunted again, a sound of satisfaction this time, and turned and walked out. The bell jingled his departure.",23,66
1pu4sqt,,"I stood there for a second, my heart hammering against my ribs. 'Fresh meat on the way.' A trucker. Headed east. No one expecting him. Alone.",26,67
1pu4sqt,,"""Your pump is all set, dear,"" the old woman said, her voice back to that frail, sweet tone. It was like she’d flipped a switch.",25,68
1pu4sqt,,"I couldn't get out of there fast enough. ""Thanks,"" I mumbled, turning and pushing the door open so hard the bell clanked against the glass.",25,69
1pu4sqt,,"The night air felt good, but it didn't wash away the sudden, slimy feeling of dread that had coated my skin. I tried to shake it off. I was tired.",30,70
1pu4sqt,,"Overreacting. They were just weird locals with a weird sense of humor. I walked over to the pump, unscrewed the caps on my tanks, and grabbed the heavy diesel nozzle.",30,71
1pu4sqt,,"As I stood there, the pump chugging away, my eyes scanned the darkness. My rig was the only vehicle in the front lot.",23,72
1pu4sqt,,"But my senses were on high alert now, and I was noticing things my tired brain had initially filtered out.",20,73
1pu4sqt,,"I let my gaze drift past the station, to the dark, gravel area behind it. And that's when I saw it.",21,74
1pu4sqt,,"Tucked away in the shadows, almost perfectly hidden from the road, was a pickup truck.",15,75
1pu4sqt,,"It was an old model, beat to hell, with a mismatched fender and a dull, rusted paint job. Its lights were off. It was just sitting there, silent and waiting.",30,76
1pu4sqt,,"As my eyes adjusted to the gloom, I realized there was someone in the driver's seat, a silhouette against the slightly less black night sky.",25,77
1pu4sqt,,"A prickle of unease turned into a full-blown alarm bell in my head. Why park back there? Why with no lights? Then, as I watched, another vehicle pulled in.",29,78
1pu4sqt,,It didn't come from the highway. It seemed to materialize from a dirt track that ran alongside the station.,19,79
1pu4sqt,,"Another beat-up pickup, this one a dark blue, though it was hard to tell in the dim light.",18,80
1pu4sqt,,"It coasted in just as silently as the first one, its engine a barely audible rumble before it was cut.",20,81
1pu4sqt,,"It parked right next to the first one, also in the shadows, also with its lights off.",17,82
1pu4sqt,,"Two men got out of that one, moving with a quiet purpose that was anything but casual. They didn't go into the station.",23,83
1pu4sqt,,"They just leaned against their truck and waited, their faces obscured by the darkness.",14,84
1pu4sqt,,"I felt like I was watching a scene from a movie I didn't want to be in. The pieces started clicking into place with a horrifying, metallic certainty.",28,85
1pu4sqt,,"The pump clicked off, the tank full. My hands were shaking as I hung up the nozzle and screwed the cap back on. My mind was racing.",27,86
1pu4sqt,,I had to get out of there. Now. I didn't even bother filling the second tank. To hell with the money.,21,87
1pu4sqt,,"Every second I spent here felt like a lifetime borrowed on credit I didn't have. I practically jogged back to my cab, my boots crunching loud in the terrible silence.",30,88
1pu4sqt,,"I kept my eyes on the station, expecting the someone to come back out, or the guys from the pickups to start walking towards me. But nothing happened.",28,89
1pu4sqt,,"Just as my hand reached the handle of my truck door, the station door opened. It was the old woman. She was holding a steaming styrofoam cup.",27,90
1pu4sqt,,"""Oh, dear, you forgot this!"" she called out, her voice carrying that same frail, grandmotherly tone. But it sounded grotesque to me now, a mask.",25,91
1pu4sqt,,"She started walking towards me, one slow, shuffling step at a time. ""I made a fresh pot of coffee. You looked so tired, I thought you could use it.",29,92
1pu4sqt,,"It's on the house. A little something to keep you awake on that long road.""

My entire body screamed NO.",20,93
1pu4sqt,,"Every instinct, every primal, self-preserving fiber of my being wanted me to get in the cab, lock the door, and lay on the horn until my hand broke.",28,94
1pu4sqt,,"But I was frozen. If I refused, what then? Would they just drop the act? Would the men from the trucks come out of the shadows?",26,95
1pu4sqt,,"The charade, however thin, felt like the only thing keeping me alive right now. Playing along might buy me a few precious seconds.",23,96
1pu4sqt,,"She reached me, her hand trembling as she held out the cup. Or was it trembling? Looking closer, her hand was steady as a rock.",25,97
1pu4sqt,,"It was the cup that was vibrating from the sloshing of the hot liquid. Her eyes, those piercingly clear eyes, were locked on mine. They weren't kind. They were expectant.",30,98
1pu4sqt,,"""You take this,"" she insisted, her voice dropping to a near-whisper. ""It'll help you. You need to rest.""

I took the cup.",22,99
1pu4sqt,,"Her skin was cold and dry as paper where her fingers brushed mine. ""Thank you, ma'am,"" I managed to choke out. The words felt like ash in my mouth.",29,100
1pu4sqt,,"""You're very welcome, dear,"" she said, that thin smile returning. ""Drive safe now.""

She turned and shuffled back to the station, disappearing inside.",23,101
1pu4sqt,,"I didn't wait to watch the door close. I scrambled up into my cab, slammed the door, and hit the locks.",21,102
1pu4sqt,,"My heart was a wild bird beating against my ribs. I jammed the key in the ignition and the diesel engine roared to life, shattering the night's silence.",28,103
1pu4sqt,,"The coffee cup sat in my cup holder, radiating a sickening, artificial warmth. I didn't dare spill it. I didn't dare throw it out the window.",26,104
1pu4sqt,,"I just left it there, a symbol of how close I'd come. I put the truck in gear and pulled out of that godforsaken lot, my tires spitting gravel.",29,105
1pu4sqt,,I didn't look at the station in my side mirror. I looked at the mirror pointed towards the back of the station.,22,106
1pu4sqt,,"As I rolled onto the highway, two pairs of headlights flicked on in the darkness behind the building. They pulled out after me, falling into formation about a quarter-mile back.",30,107
1pu4sqt,,"They didn't speed up. They didn't flash their lights. They just followed. Two beat-up pickup trucks, the silent partners in this nightmare. My blood ran cold. This was it.",29,108
1pu4sqt,,"The hunt was on. My foot pressed the accelerator to the floor. The rig groaned, slowly picking up speed. 60. 70. 80.",22,109
1pu4sqt,,"I was pushing it far beyond the safe limit, the trailer swaying slightly behind me.",15,110
1pu4sqt,,"But every time I looked in the mirror, the two sets of headlights were still there, maintaining their distance, two pairs of predatory eyes in the black.",27,111
1pu4sqt,,I grabbed my phone. Just as I suspected. No Service. I was completely and utterly alone. The next few hours were the purest form of terror I have ever known.,30,112
1pu4sqt,,"It wasn't a slasher-movie, jump-scare kind of fear. It was a slow, grinding, psychological horror. The road stretched on, an endless black void. There were no other cars. No exits.",30,113
1pu4sqt,,"No signs of civilization. Just me, my roaring engine, and the two sets of lights behind me. They were herding me. I knew it. They were patient.",27,114
1pu4sqt,,They knew this stretch of road. They knew there was nowhere for me to go. They were just waiting. Waiting for me to make a mistake.,26,115
1pu4sqt,,"Waiting for my nerve to break. Or, if their original plan had worked, waiting for the drugs in the coffee to kick in and do the job for them.",29,116
1pu4sqt,,"I glanced at the cup, still sitting there.",8,117
1pu4sqt,,"I imagined myself getting drowsy, my eyelids feeling like lead, pulling over to the shoulder… I shook my head violently, forcing the image out. My mind raced through scenarios.",29,118
1pu4sqt,,What did they want? The truck? The cargo? No. The man's words echoed in my head. ‘Fresh meat.’ It wasn't about my rig. It was about me.,27,119
1pu4sqt,,"I thought about slamming on the brakes, trying to get them to crash into my trailer. But they were keeping their distance, and what if I just jackknifed the rig?",30,120
1pu4sqt,,"I'd be a sitting duck, trapped in a wreck. I thought about trying to call them on the CB, but what would I say? And what if they answered?",29,121
1pu4sqt,,The thought of hearing one of their voices crackle over the radio was somehow more terrifying than the silence. So I just drove.,23,122
1pu4sqt,,I drove with my eyes glued to the road ahead and the mirror. My knuckles were white on the steering wheel. My body was drenched in a cold sweat.,29,123
1pu4sqt,,"Every shadow on the side of the road was a new threat, every bend a potential ambush. The hum of the engine was my only ally.",26,124
1pu4sqt,,"As long as it was running, I was moving. As long as I was moving, I was alive. The night seemed to stretch into eternity. Time lost all meaning.",29,125
1pu4sqt,,"There was only the road, the engine, the fear, and the lights. They never wavered, never got closer, never fell further behind. They were a constant, terrifying presence.",28,126
1pu4sqt,,"A promise of what was waiting for me if I stopped. Then, after what felt like a lifetime, I saw it.",21,127
1pu4sqt,,"A faint, almost imperceptible lightening of the sky on the eastern horizon. At first, I thought my tired eyes were playing tricks on me.",24,128
1pu4sqt,,"But it grew, a line of pale grey, then a soft, bruised purple. Dawn. I didn't let myself feel hope. It felt too much like a trap.",27,129
1pu4sqt,,"But as the sun began to properly crest the horizon, painting the desolate landscape in shades of orange and pink, something happened. I looked in my mirror.",27,130
1pu4sqt,,"The headlights behind me were gone. I scanned the road behind me, my heart in my throat. The two pickup trucks were still there, but they were falling back. Rapidly.",30,131
1pu4sqt,,"As the first rays of direct sunlight spilled over the plains and hit my windshield, I looked in the mirror one last time.",23,132
1pu4sqt,,"The two trucks were making a sharp, synchronized U-turn in the middle of the empty highway, and speeding off in the direction we'd come from. They were gone.",28,133
1pu4sqt,,Just like that. The sunlight had saved me.,8,134
1pu4sqt,,"It was like they were creatures of the dark, unable or unwilling to operate in the light of day where they could be seen, identified.",25,135
1pu4sqt,,"I drove for another ten miles, my body shaking with adrenaline and relief, before I finally pulled over. I killed the engine and the silence that rushed in was beautiful.",30,136
1pu4sqt,,"It was the silence of survival. I sat there for a long time, watching the sun climb higher in the sky, just breathing. My eyes fell on the styrofoam cup.",30,137
1pu4sqt,,"With a convulsive, angry movement, I snatched it, rolled down the window, and hurled it out into the desert.",19,138
1pu4sqt,,"I watched it tumble into a ditch, a tiny, harmless-looking piece of white trash that held a death sentence. I finished my haul. I delivered my load.",27,139
1pu4sqt,,"I did it on autopilot, the terror of that night replaying in a constant loop in my head.",18,140
1pu4sqt,,"I looked like hell, and my boss told me to take a few days off.",15,141
1pu4sqt,,The first thing I did was go to the state police barracks for the county where the station was.,19,142
1pu4sqt,,I sat in a sterile interrogation room and told my story to a weary-looking officer with a thick mustache. I told him everything.,23,143
1pu4sqt,,"The station, the old woman, her questions, the man, the phrase 'fresh meat', the trucks, the coffee, the chase.",19,144
1pu4sqt,,"He wrote it all down, but the look on his face was one of polite, professional disbelief. ""So,"" he said, tapping his pen on his notepad.",26,145
1pu4sqt,,"""You're saying this gas station, which isn't on any of our maps, by the way, is a front for some kind of… hunting party?",24,146
1pu4sqt,,"And they chase truckers through the night?""

""I'm telling you what happened,"" I said, my voice tight. ""That coffee was drugged.",21,147
1pu4sqt,,"They were going to kill me.""

""And you have this coffee?""

""I threw it out! I was terrified!""

He sighed. ""Look, sir. You truckers drive long hours.",27,148
1pu4sqt,,"The mind can play tricks on you when you're fatigued.""

I insisted. I gave him the mile marker where I thought it was. I described the turnoff.",27,149
1pu4sqt,,"I told him he had to check it out. To his credit, and probably just to shut me up, he agreed to humor me.",24,150
1pu4sqt,,He said he'd take a drive out there when he had a chance. I knew that meant never. So I pushed. I told him I'd ride with him.,28,151
1pu4sqt,,"I'd show him the exact spot. After a long argument, he reluctantly agreed, probably thinking it was the fastest way to prove me crazy.",24,152
1pu4sqt,,"So the next day, I was in the passenger seat of his cruiser, driving back down that same dark stretch of highway, this time in the bright, unforgiving light of day.",31,153
1pu4sqt,,"My stomach was in knots. ""It should be right up here,"" I said, my voice hoarse. ""Around this bend.""

We came around the bend, and there it was.",28,154
1pu4sqt,,"The dirt turnoff. The cracked asphalt lot. The single-story building with the low, flat roof. ""See?"" I said, a wave of vindication washing over me.",25,155
1pu4sqt,,"""I told you.""

The officer didn't say anything. He just pulled the cruiser into the lot and put it in park. We both got out. The building was there.",29,156
1pu4sqt,,"But it wasn't a gas station. It was a derelict. A shell. The windows were boarded up from the inside, thick with cobwebs and grime.",25,157
1pu4sqt,,"The door was hanging off one hinge, held shut by a rusty padlock.",13,158
1pu4sqt,,"The sign that had read ""_AS & _AT"" was just a rusted metal frame, the plastic long gone.",18,159
1pu4sqt,,"The pumps were there, but they were skeletal remains, their hoses rotted away, their metal casings pitted with rust and time. I walked over and looked at the dial.",29,160
1pu4sqt,,"It was rusted solid. These things hadn't pumped a gallon of fuel in thirty years. ""This is it?"" the officer asked, his voice flat.",24,161
1pu4sqt,,"I walked over to the building and peered through a crack in the boarded-up window. I expected to see the dusty shelves, the counter, the cooler. There was nothing.",29,162
1pu4sqt,,"The inside was completely, totally empty. It was a single, hollow room. Bare floorboards, crumbling drywall. No counter. No shelves. No wiring for a cooler.",25,163
1pu4sqt,,There was a thick layer of dust on the floor that was completely undisturbed. No footprints. No sign that anyone had been inside for decades. It was a ghost.,29,164
1pu4sqt,,"An empty stage. We checked the gravel lot behind the building. There were some old, faded tire tracks, but nothing fresh.",21,165
1pu4sqt,,Nothing to indicate two heavy pickup trucks had been sitting there just a few nights before. The officer looked at me. The polite disbelief was gone.,26,166
1pu4sqt,,"Now it was just pity. ""Let's go, son,"" he said, gently. I couldn't speak. I just stood there, staring at the hollow building, the empty pumps, the silent, sun-baked lot.",30,167
1pu4sqt,,"It was real. I know it was. The woman, the coffee, the terror. But the evidence was gone, wiped clean by the light of day.",25,168
1pu4sqt,,It was a trap that materialized in the darkness and vanished with the dawn.,14,169
1pu4sqt,,"A net cast for the lonely, the isolated, the ones no one would miss for a day or two. I don't know what they are. Ghouls, opportunists, something in between.",30,170
1pu4sqt,,"But they're out there. And they have a system. They know the empty roads, the dead zones. They set up their stage and they wait. So this is my warning.",30,171
1pu4sqt,,To all of you who travel the lonely roads at night.,11,172

1pu4sqt,,"I'm telling you, it is better to be stranded. It is better to run out of gas and wait for the sun.",22,174
1pu4sqt,,"Because if you pull into that station, and a frail old woman tells you how scared she is of being alone, you need to understand that you're the one who should be scared.",33,175

1pu2jjh,,Fast forward a year and I’m still an uber driver with a boat load of student debt and a degree gathering dust.,22,2
1pu2jjh,,"Ride requests tend to quiet down from 9pm on weekdays but as soon as it hits Friday or the weekend, no sooner do I accept one request three more are sent my way.",33,3
1pu2jjh,,"One night I had just about enough of all the drunk students piling into my car and arguing with me to take their friend who was already vomiting in the drain by my wheels, that when I received a request from out in the countryside I immediately clicked yes.",49,4
1pu2jjh,,"I felt relieved to finally leave the city streets after so long but as soon as those neon lights faded away in my mirror, I felt an unease come over me.",31,5
1pu2jjh,,After driving so long the lack of other cars on the road didn’t really cross my mind until I was just a couple meters away from the pickup location.,29,6
1pu2jjh,,Completely autopilot until this very moment when it felt like I was being shook awake and subjected to a barrage of “red alert your about to be killed by an axe wielding madman”.,33,7
1pu2jjh,,There were no streetlights whatsoever and the only visible light for as far as the eye could see where my headlights failing to pierce the dark endless void ahead of me.,31,8
1pu2jjh,,100 yards away from pickup. It was a field. Baron and lifeless without a single strand of green grass or crop in sight.,23,9
1pu2jjh,,"No barn, no tractor, or cow, or sheep, or anything.",10,10
1pu2jjh,,I pulled up directly on top of the pickup spot and stared about me at a loss surrounded by darkness in a desolate land.,24,11
1pu2jjh,,I sat there drumming my fingers on the wheel and humming along to the radio trying not freak out until suddenly the passenger door behind me swung open.,28,12
1pu2jjh,,"The seat behind groaned in protest and I felt a noticeable give in the car as it dipped heavily, and the car door slammed closed.",25,13
1pu2jjh,,I swivelled round in my seat to see my rider and froze instantly my voice hitching.,16,14
1pu2jjh,,There in the passenger seat sat a young women dressed in a flower pattern skirt and a woolly jumper but something about her felt off.,25,15
1pu2jjh,,"She looked normal enough, but it was something about her eyes. They looked too big for her face. Her sockets even.",21,16
1pu2jjh,,They seemed to bulge almost forcing the bone to widen causing the skin around to stretch haphazardly.,17,17
1pu2jjh,,"Granted there wasn’t much light in the car besides my phone, but I swear her pupils seemed to take up almost the entirety of her eyes.",26,18
1pu2jjh,,She must have noticed my uneasiness since she smiled at me with her thin and cracked lips and nodded cueing me to go. She was silent the entire drive.,29,19
1pu2jjh,,"I even asked her awkwardly whether she was okay with the radio being left on, but she didn’t say anything.",20,20
1pu2jjh,,"She just sat there staring straight into my rearview mirror smiling. When I reached her destination, it was just an old retail park.",23,21
1pu2jjh,,All the shops where closed or abandoned with boarded up doors and smashed in windows. I pulled up along the curve and told to her to “have a nice night”.,30,22
1pu2jjh,,She just smiled and calmly opened the door and stepped out watching me as I drove off.,17,23
1pu2jjh,,The whole incident really freaked me out and I decided to end the night right there and then and go home.,21,24
1pu2jjh,,"The very next morning however, I checked the app and saw that I had been tipped for my last ride. “Flora tipped £50”.",23,25
1pu2jjh,,The ride itself cost only £15 but I’d get £11.25 after Uber took their share.,15,26
1pu2jjh,,I couldn’t believe my luck and felt a weight fall from my chest being able to pay my rent for the month.,22,27
1pu2jjh,,"So for the week after I continued my rides as usual and when “Flora” requested a ride I clicked yes, every time.",22,28
1pu2jjh,,"It was always the same pickup location and drop off, and she’d always do the same thing. I’d park in the field, turn the radio on and wait.",28,29
1pu2jjh,,"She would appear out of the darkness from the right, open the door and sit behind me smiling.",18,30
1pu2jjh,,"We’d arrive at the retail park, and she’d step out watching me leave. £50 tip every ride for 3 rides a week and I was making bank.",27,31
1pu2jjh,,"However a few days ago, something changed. I parked in the field and turned the radio on, and out stepped Flora wearing the same outfit she always does.",28,32
1pu2jjh,,"This time though, instead of sitting behind me she sat directly next to me. She had swivelled round to face me and didn’t blink once.",25,33
1pu2jjh,,"I turned to her and said, “Hi Flora, ready to go?” and she nodded but just before I set off something on her jumper caught my eye.",27,34
1pu2jjh,,"I never noticed it before, but on her jumper was a name tag that read “Sarah”.",16,35
1pu2jjh,,"I had grown used to her so much that all of the weirdness about her that first ride had melted away so I asked her, “Would you like me to call you Flora or Sarah?” and pointed at the name tag.",41,36
1pu2jjh,,I shouldn’t have said anything. For the first time ever she stopped smiling. She kind of frowned slightly at the question and sat in silence for a minute.,28,37
1pu2jjh,,It felt like an eternity looking into those vacant abyssal eyes waiting for an answer.,15,38
1pu2jjh,,"Suddenly, her mouth opened beginning from the corners reaching to the middle like a zipper and widened unnaturally.",18,39
1pu2jjh,,"The only light in the car was my phone screen as it always was, but I swear that inside of that mouth was completely empty.",25,40
1pu2jjh,,She looked like one of those plastic baby dolls which had a permanent open mouth for a bottle but didn’t have any teeth or painted gums.,26,41
1pu2jjh,,Just complete darkness all the way in.,7,42
1pu2jjh,,A bubble began to form around her lips in the few seconds they were open and burst as “Sarah” erupted from her mouth before snapping closed and resuming a smile.,30,43
1pu2jjh,,Her voice sounded static and strangely high pitched unlike anything I’ve heard. The wheel was slick with my sweat and the car revved slightly from my shaking legs.,28,44
1pu2jjh,,I forced a smile and began to drive with those giant eyes fixed on me.,15,45
1pu2jjh,,"I felt my heart pounding in my chest as I pushed down on the accelerator racing towards the drop off where she would finally leave, but as I rounded the corner of the woods a deer sprang out in front of me.",42,46
1pu2jjh,,Smashing into the hood of my car and skidding across the road in front leaving behind a perfect glistening streak of blood.,22,47
1pu2jjh,,I stared ahead towards the deer my heart beating louder and louder pulsing from within my ears until a notification rang from my phone reading “Ride cancelled”.,27,48
1pu2jjh,,The passenger door swung open and Sarah stepped out from the car walking towards the deer before stopping and turning to wave me goodbye.,24,49
1pu2jjh,,To my astonishment I woke up the next morning to a tip of £100 and a message that read “See you again soon”.,23,50
1pu2jjh,,"I really need the money, but I don’t know if I I’m pushing my luck with this situation and I really need some advice.",24,51
1pu17iu,My local priest talked to something that seemed like God,"Until I was thirteen, I lived in a desolate town around Baja Arizona.",13,0
1pu17iu,,"Half of the dwindling population was Hispanic, with the other half being the descendants of mostly Irish immigrant workers who came out here to work in the old silver mine.",30,1
1pu17iu,,"Today, the mine has long since been depleted, and our small community was racked with unemployment.",16,2
1pu17iu,,"Most who did work worked in the nearest city, and some only came back to their families on the weekend.",20,3
1pu17iu,,"Sunday mass was unmissable, and was the one day out of the week that I would be reminded that my town was still alive.",24,4
1pu17iu,,"The bone white church stood in the center of the community, and every dust road led to its doors.",19,5
1pu17iu,,"Sunday mornings, I would dress myself in my best clothes and walk to the Holy building with my mother, father, older brother and infant sister.",25,6
1pu17iu,,"This particular Sunday began like all the rest, with a dozen or more other families following our same routine.",19,7
1pu17iu,,"It was early December, although you couldn't tell from the cloudless sky.",12,8
1pu17iu,,"Nearing midday, it was already 66 degrees and rising, although the blisteringly cold nights made up for the warm days.",20,9
1pu17iu,,"After the short walk we reached the church, where the usual crowd of townsfolk congregated inside. My family entered the fray, and immediately noticed something was off.",27,10
1pu17iu,,"Father Abascal was our only resident priest. He was born here in the 1950s, before moving to California.",18,11
1pu17iu,,"There, he entered priesthood and took on the role of missionary, traveling primarily to central Africa to spread the word of the lord, as well as polio vaccines.",28,12
1pu17iu,,"Father Abascal talked often of his time in developing nations, and usually found a way to tie his experiences in with whatever parable we were covering.",26,13
1pu17iu,,"Later in life, he opted for a change of pace and returned to his hometown, whose population had halved since he left.",22,14
1pu17iu,,"In the fifteen years since his return, it has halved again. But our community's future, or a lack thereof, was not the troubling thing the crowd were discussing that day.",30,15
1pu17iu,,"An hour before, the Spanish language mass had taken place. Those in attendance, mostly older folk, now seemed distraught.",19,16
1pu17iu,,"I wasn't fluent in Spanish, but learned it at school and heard it around town regularly enough that I could pick up the majority of what they were saying.",29,17
1pu17iu,,"Father Abascal seemed tired and unprofessional. There were large gaps of silence in his sermons, and he seemed to constantly slur his words.",23,18
1pu17iu,,"The organ player had not shown up, nor had the altar boys. Father Abascal staggered through mass on his own, and had barked at the old attendees to stay behind.",30,19
1pu17iu,,"Before this talk could reach the ears of everyone in the crowd, the church bell rang out and we began to fold into the pews.",25,20
1pu17iu,,"Sunday mass was packed to the rafters most weeks, but in the lead up to Christmas, the church now weekly housed the town's entire, diminutive population.",26,21
1pu17iu,,"A continuous drone of talk and gossip continued as we took our seats, and ended abruptly when Father Abascal emerged.",20,22
1pu17iu,,"I was near the front, and had the displeasure of seeing him clearly in that state.",16,23
1pu17iu,,His tired eyes were ringed with black bags that seemed to sag down his face.,15,24
1pu17iu,,"He looked around the congregation frantically, and both the bridge of his nose and the corners of his lips twitched uncontrollably. His usual plump cheeks appeared sunken and grey.",29,25
1pu17iu,,"He lurched uneasily toward the altar like a marionette. Hushed whispers enveloped the congregation, all directed at the priest's state.",20,26
1pu17iu,,"I looked around, catching the glances of many who likewise searched around in confusion. Father Abascal cleared his throat, ready to speak.",22,27
1pu17iu,,"This turned into a cough fit, which had him bent double, spluttering into his elbow. When he righted himself, I saw that his sleeve was now freshly stained black.",29,28
1pu17iu,,"He gripped both sides of his altar, his raw fingernails digging into the masonry. Finally, he spoke.",17,29
1pu17iu,,"“Fine people,” he began, his voice laboured and hoarse, “I am become a witness. I have received confirmation from above of my most evil minded suspicions.”

Gasps erupted.",28,30
1pu17iu,,"Some stood, shocked at the Holy man's claim. I looked at my parents, who sat pensively, not yet ready to discredit the man who'd just baptised their first daughter.",29,31
1pu17iu,,"“While I slept, He spoke to me, He showed me terrible things and commanded my next actions,” Father Abascal continued, “I know now of the Great Breach of the Papacy.",30,32
1pu17iu,,"Please, be seated as I spread deistic warning.”

Some faltered and sat back down. Others, the more agitated among them, rushed to the doors only to find them locked.",29,33
1pu17iu,,"As were the windows. Father Abascal cleared his throat, flecks of black bile peppering his clerical gowns. Then he continued.",20,34
1pu17iu,,"“It began with Theophylact, Count of Tusculum,” He said, a crazed look in his eye, “he and his wife Theodora had an insatiable hunger for power. Insatiable.",27,35
1pu17iu,,"In 903 AD, Theophylact met with a hooded man, shortly after midnight. The hooded man presented him with a deal.",20,36
1pu17iu,,"He would aid in the family's conquest, in return for a betrothal to one of Theophylact's descendents.",17,37
1pu17iu,,"He agreed willingly to these terms, and shook the hooded man's hand on this matter.",15,38
1pu17iu,,"They never met again, but within the year, Theophylact and his family had consolidated power over all Rome.",18,39
1pu17iu,,"From the day of that deal onwards, however, the hand Theophylact had shaken with the hooded man became frost bitten, forcing him to bind it for the rest of his days.”

Father Abascal showed his own hand for dramatic effect.",40,40
1pu17iu,,"I can remember tugging at my collar, feeling hot and anxious. I looked to my parents for guidance, but they remained apprehensive to act.",24,41
1pu17iu,,"With nothing else to do, I slumped back into the pew and continued watching the rambling.",16,42
1pu17iu,,"I wondered what jokes I could make about it tomorrow at school, where it'd assumedly be all people would be talking about.",22,43
1pu17iu,,"“From then on, years of ruinous debauchery plagued the Papacy,” Abascal continued, “Rome was ruled by harlots!",17,44
1pu17iu,,"For decades, it was under the thumb of the House of Theophylact, until the army of the Holy Roman Empire was forced to intervene.",24,45
1pu17iu,,"But even this only dampened the heretical flame.”

Father Abascal slumped forward onto the altar, panting. He looked physically exhausted.",20,46
1pu17iu,,"An old woman shuffled to his side, but he shook her off, commanding she sit back down. He took some deep breaths, righted himself, and kept going.",27,47
1pu17iu,,"“In 996 AD, it came time for the hooded man to collect his debt,” He spoke in a morose and shaken voice, “and collect it he did.",27,48
1pu17iu,,"Maria, wife of Gregory I, grandson of Theophylact, became pregnant with twins. But only one of them was hers.",19,49
1pu17iu,,"The other was instilled by the hooded man.”

The crowd stirred as we all realised the implication. Abascal continued.",19,50
1pu17iu,,"“It was The Unholy Son, birthed from the womb of a whore with an accursed lineage.",16,51
1pu17iu,,"And birth it she did, for in the 25th night of July in 996, it came gushing out of her in a torrent of blood.",25,52
1pu17iu,,"So did Maria's natural born son, whom she cradled while the leech was set down upon the dirty floor.",19,53
1pu17iu,,"As soon as its infantile costume touched the stone, the door burst open. A farm dog ran it and attacked the newborn, tearing it apart.",25,54
1pu17iu,,"Like that, the antichrist had been sealed for another thousand years.”

The use of the word “antichrist” sent the congregation into a frenzy.",23,55
1pu17iu,,"People stood, shouting at Abascal to step down.",8,56
1pu17iu,,"Some rushed to his side, only to have the deranged priest roar at them, demanding he be allowed to spread God's recent message.",23,57
1pu17iu,,"Even my parents were stirred, although they stopped short of rushing their kids out of there.",16,58
1pu17iu,,"Father Abascal finally took the church back under his control, if only by being the loudest voice there.",18,59
1pu17iu,,"After another coughing fit, he hauled a case that had been set down by his side onto the altar.",19,60
1pu17iu,,"It was long and tubular, not unlike something used to carry a rolled up map. He unscrewed the cap, but stopped short of taking out whatever was within.",28,61
1pu17iu,,He bent over the altar again and started to speak. “But the evil hadn't been wholly killed off.,18,62
1pu17iu,,"Part of it festered in its womb-brother, who grew up to become the wealthy count, Alberic III. His own son, Theophylact III, became Pope at just twenty years of age.",30,63
1pu17iu,,"A malice unfound in any man before him accompanied his pontificate. Murder, rape, incest and beastiality all found a common home in the Lateran Palace.",25,64
1pu17iu,,"He ruled as Benedict IX, becoming Pope three times and committing high simony as he did, selling the very Papacy for a sum of gold.",25,65
1pu17iu,,"His leadership was ruinous, and achieved only the splitting of the church in 1054. Eventually, holy forces did defeat this antipeter, but the House of Theophylact remained tainted.",28,66
1pu17iu,,"Their bloodline spawned countless adversarial members until their domain, the town of Tusculum, was completely levelled by the Crescentii family.",20,67
1pu17iu,,"Now this accursed lineage was scattered across the known world, and eventually the new world.”

Father Abascal faltered.",18,68
1pu17iu,,"His breathing seemed cancerous now, as his bile filled lungs worked to deliver us this message.",16,69
1pu17iu,,"“I've been told from above,” he said again as he raised his head, “that the chosen descendent is among us. In this chapel.”

Anarchy.",24,70
1pu17iu,,"People leapt from their seats, many trying for the locked door. Abascal raged, though few heeded him. He swore, and said things I thought I'd never hear him say.",29,71
1pu17iu,,"I looked at my parents, who likewise were now getting up for the pew. I stood, not taking my eyes from the mad priest.",24,72
1pu17iu,,He had heaved the carrier bag onto the altar and removed the lid.,13,73
1pu17iu,,"He slid out the contents onto the marble slab and for a second, I thought it was a map. Until Father Abascal unfurled it.",24,74
1pu17iu,,"It was some sort of tapestry, ancient and crumbling. He took two corners and held it up in front of the congregation.",22,75
1pu17iu,,"The scene depicted had faded, but I could tell it was to do with the story Abascal had just recanted.",20,76
1pu17iu,,"It showed a dog, drawn with a distinctly medieval quality, with an infant's head in its jaws. The rest of the baby flailed in the air.",26,77
1pu17iu,,"On its forehead was a symbol, one I could barely remember but later identified as the seal of lucifer.",19,78
1pu17iu,,"As I looked at it, I felt the tears that had welled in my eyes grow hot. They were boiling. Suddenly, my mother burst into flames.",26,79
1pu17iu,,"My sister too, cradled in her arms, was engulfed. The manic crowd's attention turned to the sudden immolation.",18,80
1pu17iu,,"Father Abascal began screaming like a fanatic and rushed towards us, but was held back by one of the attendees.",20,81
1pu17iu,,"I burst into tears as my brother dragged me away from the human pyre. My father threw off his jacket, attempting to quell the flames. It was no use.",29,82
1pu17iu,,"My mother died between the pews, suffocated by the smoke borne from her burning flesh. It was all over so fast.",21,83
1pu17iu,,"My father collapsed to his knees, trying to drag his wife from the position she reflexively crumpled into.",18,84
1pu17iu,,"By now, the wooden pew had caught alight, and other members of the church had to force my dad away from the spreading fire.",24,85
1pu17iu,,"All the while, Abascal screamed about how he'd purged the evil. The doors didn't budge.",15,86
1pu17iu,,A stone basin of Holy water was upheaved and used to pummel the entrance like a battering ram.,18,87
1pu17iu,,"As the fire spread and the crowd became more desperate for salvation, someone threw a statue of Our Lady of Gaudalupe through one of the stained glass windows bearing the image of Christ's crucifixion.",34,88
1pu17iu,,"She shattered her son, and for a brief moment I thought we finally had a path of escape until I realised what was so desperately wrong with the scene.",29,89
1pu17iu,,"Despite it being noon, there was nothing outside but darkness. I stumbled back, watching everyone I knew act like wild animals in their attempt at escape.",26,90
1pu17iu,,Old men and children were crumpled underfoot as the stampeding faithful tried to break out into the fake night. My breathing drew heavy as my eyes began to close.,29,91
1pu17iu,,There was smoke all around me. It was all I could smell. All I could taste. It was everything. The sound of screams dampened as I fell into unconsciousness.,29,92
1pu17iu,,I awoke an unknowable amount of time later to the sound of a baby crying.,15,93
1pu17iu,,"There were stars overhead, and as I pushed myself up from the charred floor, I realised the chapel's roof had burned to ashes. I was surrounded by a black ruin.",30,94
1pu17iu,,"I stood, surveying the debris of smoking embers and bone for the source of the crying. I walked unsteadily towards it, carbon crunching under my shoes.",26,95
1pu17iu,,"Bodies, cooked alive during the fire, were scattered all around. Most were concentrated in the large pile, stacked where the broken window once stood.",24,96
1pu17iu,,"The ash of the burnt pews covered everything in a black carpet, including my baby sister.",16,97
1pu17iu,,"I leaned down and picked her up, tearing her from the skeletal grasp of my mother.",16,98
1pu17iu,,"I brushed her down and let her cling to my shoulder, putting a calming hand on her back as I soothed the infant.",23,99
1pu17iu,,"Other than some dust, she hadn't been harmed. That was impossible, I can remember thinking to myself. I saw her become engulfed in flames.",24,100
1pu17iu,,"And then I realised I myself was a miracle. Human remains surrounded me where I had lain, all dead by immolation. Despite this, I didn't have the slightest burn.",29,101
1pu17iu,,"The impossibility of it all was the last thought on my mind, however, as I realised I was now alone in the world.",23,102
1pu17iu,,"I identified my father from the scraps of fabric that remained of his pale blue jacket, and my brother from the metal watch which had begun to melt and fused to his wrist bone.",34,103
1pu17iu,,"My family had been whittled down to just me and my sister. I stumbled through the burnt, crumbling doors and went outside. There, I started to cry.",27,104
1pu17iu,,"I kept crying for some time, accompanied by the baby I now clung to. I didn't stop until I heard something move in the darkness.",25,105
1pu17iu,,"I wiped my red cheeks and tapered my whimpers, then tried to do the same with my sister. I could now hear someone trying to walk towards us.",28,106
1pu17iu,,"Their feet dragged slightly in the dusty road, and the noise of their shambling grew louder each passing second. Still, the night enshrouded them.",24,107
1pu17iu,,"White ash fell like snow, although the temperature had begun to drop so low that a blizzard wouldn't feel out of place.",22,108
1pu17iu,,"I realised my sister was shivering, and held her tighter, trying to pass on what body warmth I had left. A figure appeared, just a silhouette and their current distance.",30,109
1pu17iu,,"Silently, they kept coming closer. “Hello?” I said in a low voice.",12,110
1pu17iu,,"My first and most obvious assumption was that it was one of the townsfolk, one who didn't show up to mass this morning.",23,111
1pu17iu,,"Surely, I can remember thinking to myself, there must've been a fair few still left in their homes when the fire erupted.",22,112
1pu17iu,,"It wasn't until the figure was almost directly in front of me did I realise how wrong I was. It stood still now, dressed in a long, tattered black robe.",30,113
1pu17iu,,"White ash flakes collect on its broad shoulders and once pointed hood. I couldn't see any face within, just more darkness that outdid the night sky.",26,114
1pu17iu,,"I felt bolted to the floor from fear, and maybe something else. “Ireup ihim ad,” the robbed man said, speaking with a warped, baritone voice.",25,115
1pu17iu,,"It then reached out its arms. From within its long sleeves, two necrotic hands appeared.",15,116
1pu17iu,,Maggots festered under its black finger nails and the skin sagged down from a build up of pus. I realised it wanted me to give it my sister.,28,117
1pu17iu,,“Who… who are you?” I barely managed to say.,9,118
1pu17iu,,"“Sutroba ied mus oge,” it said in twisted answer, “Ireup suilli retap.”

Before I could say anything else, the robed figure pulled back its hood.",25,119
1pu17iu,,"Whatever I saw then now occupies a black hole in my mind, unable to be called upon.",17,120
1pu17iu,,"Even in the past few days as my reality crumbles, I cannot incur that aberration in my mind's eye. That night in 1996, it caused me to run in terror.",30,121
1pu17iu,,"I flew past rows of houses, any of which that had been occupied a few hours before were now occupied only by ash.",23,122
1pu17iu,,"My sister stayed close to me, and I eventually reached the edge of my desolate town. Beyond lay only the Sonoran desert.",22,123
1pu17iu,,"For miles, nothing, then came the great slab of concrete that was the city of Tucson.",16,124
1pu17iu,,"I looked back and saw the hooded figure approaching, and decided that the wilderness at night was a worthwhile risk to escape anything that bore that face.",27,125
1pu17iu,,I had no idea what direction I was heading. I was only wearing a t-shirt and shorts.,17,126
1pu17iu,,"I now carried my sister under my shirt, and my exposed legs were cut up by glass-like shrubs.",18,127
1pu17iu,,"I had an idea of the landscape I was traversing from what I saw during the day. It was empty, apart from the dried undergrowth and occasional rock formation.",29,128
1pu17iu,,The cracked ground was made almost entirely of orange hued dust.,11,129
1pu17iu,,"That night, my visibility was extremely limited, and would have been reduced to nothing at all if not for the slither of moonlight.",23,130

1pu17iu,,"Like a toddler, I closed my eyes tighter and simply wished for it to be gone. For everything bad to be gone. I clutched my sister tightly.",27,162

1pu0dcf,,We keep the lights off except for a small clip-on lamp I bought on Amazon. It’s enough to read by. Barely enough to see anything else.,26,3
1pu0dcf,,We live in a small town. The kind where the silence is heavy enough to hear your own breathing.,19,4
1pu0dcf,,"So the first time I heard her talking, it annoyed me more than it scared me. It was maybe two weeks ago. A half-conversation muffled through the bedroom door.",29,5
1pu0dcf,,"Words I couldn't quite make out, then silence, then more words. Like she was on the phone. ""You talking to me?"" I called out. Nothing. She just stopped.",28,6
1pu0dcf,,"Probably her sister, I figured. They talk constantly, about nothing. Though it was late for that. I let it slide. The next night, same thing.",25,7
1pu0dcf,,"Except this time it was lower. A whisper. I tilted my head toward the bedroom, straining to hear, but I couldn't make out the words. Just the rhythm. *Question. Pause.",30,8
1pu0dcf,,"Answer.* *Question. Pause. Answer.*

""Babe, did you call me?""

""What? No."" Blunt. Annoyed. It occurred to me later—she must be praying.",21,9
1pu0dcf,,"I’ve been openly agnostic since we met, but things have been hard lately. People turn to fairy tales when life gets difficult. And life *had* gotten difficult.",27,10
1pu0dcf,,"I lost my job three months ago. The photo printing shop downtown—outdated business model, incompetent management. My boss was an idiot who didn't recognize what he had in me.",29,11
1pu0dcf,,"Maria took it harder than I expected. She’s been to the hospital three times in the past month alone. *Fatigue*, she says.",22,12
1pu0dcf,,"I told her what any reasonable person would: eat more, drink more water, get some rest. But she insisted on seeing a specialist.",23,13
1pu0dcf,,"Eighty dollars a consultation, and you know what he told her? Eat more. I didn't say ""I told you so."" I’m not that kind of husband.",26,14
1pu0dcf,,"But the visits kept happening. And the pills started. Vitamins, supplements, something for anxiety—I stopped keeping track.",17,15
1pu0dcf,,"I told her the caffeine was probably making things worse, but she just looked at me with those wide, glassy eyes. The praying continued. Got longer. Louder.",27,16
1pu0dcf,,"One night I heard her laugh. Soft. It wasn't a happy sound. It sounded like something snapping. Another night, I heard her crying during one of the conversations.",28,17
1pu0dcf,,"Then the crying stopped abruptly, mid-sob, and she said *""Yes""* very clearly. Then nothing. During the day, Maria started watching me.",21,18
1pu0dcf,,"I’d be on the couch, job listings open on my laptop—though nothing in this town pays what I'm worth—and I’d feel it.",22,19
1pu0dcf,,"I’d look up and she’d be standing in the kitchen doorway. Just staring. Head tilted slightly. ""What's wrong?"" I'd ask. She wouldn't answer. She wouldn't even blink.",27,20
1pu0dcf,,"She’d just turn and walk away, her bare feet silent on the floorboards. Then, two nights ago. I was in my chair, lamp on, listening.",25,21
1pu0dcf,,The whispering had been going for twenty minutes. It was different. Faster. More urgent. I heard my name (I’m almost sure I heard my name) and then: *Silence*. Then laughter.,30,22
1pu0dcf,,"Not Maria’s. Deeper. It sounded like rocks grinding together inside a throat. I sat frozen, telling myself I’d imagined it. The mind plays tricks when you’re tired.",27,23
1pu0dcf,,When your wife is sick and your savings are draining and nothing is going the way it should. I slept on the couch that night.,25,24

1pu0dcf,,"Or pretending to. **BANG. BANG. BANG.**

Three hits. Hard. Deliberate. From the bedroom. I launched out of my chair, heart slamming against my ribs.",24,26
1pu0dcf,,"The bedroom door was closed—it was always closed now. I stood motionless for what it felt like an hour. *""Are you okay?""* I finally asked, my voice came out cracked.",30,27
1pu0dcf,,"Silence. *""Maria?""*

And then I heard it. Not her voice. Something wearing her voice. ***""She sleeps now.""***

It came from everywhere. The walls. The floor. Inside my own skull.",29,28
1pu0dcf,,"My chest seized. I watched the air under the door disturb the dust. I smelled it then, rotten meat? I dismissed the scent because of how scared I was.",29,29
1pu0dcf,,"I don't know how long I stood there. Eventually, my legs started moving. Each step felt impossibly loud. The door handle was cold. Colder than ice. It burned my palm.",30,30
1pu0dcf,,I opened the door. The moonlight was bright—bright enough to see everything. I wish it hadn’t been. Maria was on the bed. Half on it.,25,31
1pu0dcf,,"Her legs were still tangled in the sheets, but her torso hung backward off the edge, spine bent at an angle that shouldn't be possible.",25,32
1pu0dcf,,"Her head was nearly touching the floor. Her arms were stretched out, rigid. Her eyes were open. Her mouth was open. **She was smiling.**

I slammed the door and ran.",30,33
1pu0dcf,,"I panicked. I ran toward the living room, toward my chair, toward the light. But the lamp was off. I don't remember turning it off. Everything is dark now.",29,34
1pu0dcf,,The kind of dark where you feel heavy. I’m using my phone to type this. Six percent battery. A moment ago I held the screen up toward the hallway.,29,35
1pu0dcf,,"There were no eyes. No monster. Just a shape. A silhouette standing in the hallway, impossibly tall. Its head was scraping the ceiling. It wasn't walking.",26,36
1pu0dcf,,"It was *unfolding.*

I dropped the phone. When I raised it again, the hall was empty. But I can hear breathing now. Not mine.",24,37
1pu0dcf,,"And Maria’s voice, right against my ear, wet and hot, even though nothing is there:

***""They say you'll do nicely""***

Four percent. The breathing is [closer](",26,38

1ptyutb,,"I clapped many times in a row calling his name out louder. I stood there watching, listening. After a full minute waiting there I heard it. One singular, distinct clap.",30,4
1ptyutb,,It echoed back at me from deep inside the woods behind my house off to the left.,17,5
1ptyutb,,"I stood for a couple of seconds thinking about what I just heard, analyzing the sound. I then closed the sliding glass door, locked it and slid the curtains closed.",30,6

1ptyutb,,"I didn’t see his face in the back window where he usually sits to wait for me, but I went to the back door anyways and slid the door open.",30,14
1ptyutb,,"“Nova!”
I called out. Clapping once or twice was enough to send him sprinting back inside.",16,15
1ptyutb,,"He didn’t stop just inside the threshold, but kept running far into the house all the way into the kitchen. I closed and locked the door again following him.",29,16
1ptyutb,,"“Hey buddy, you coulda come when I called you the first time yknow”
I said with a laugh. “You hungry?” 
I asked him walking to the cubbord.",27,17

1ptyutb,,"I started opening a can of wet turkey, and 
before I could even get the food onto his plate he forced his face under the can desperate for snacks.",29,20
1ptyutb,,He began eating huge bites like he’d been surviving off the forest mice. Mid way through his eating he stopped abruptly and shot his head up.,26,21
1ptyutb,,"He was standing at attention, eyes locked on the front door, which also consisted mostly of huge floor to ceiling windows. He stared for a full two minutes.",28,22
1ptyutb,,"I stepped away from the water I was boiling to peak, nothing there.",13,23
1ptyutb,,"He eventually broke focus, and with a few more tiny nibbles he retired to the living room where he kept watchful eye on the back door for the rest of the night.",32,24

1ptys96,,The head in the doorway almost grazed the top. This time I closed my eyes out of fear. What the hell was that and why was it so tall?,29,73

1ptys96,,"Most importantly it didn't feel like one, the fear was too real, I remember shaking and sweating cold.",18,82
1ptys96,,"When I thought it could get any worse, I remembered the most crucial detail. I didn't hear the dog, it was silent the whole time.",25,83

1ptylpx,,"""Because I want to know, David,"" he said, his face expressionless. ""How do you know my name?"" I asked, a chill running through me. This was getting creepy.",28,3

The stranger leaned forward and looked me in the eye. His stare was cold and unwavering.",19,4
1ptylpx,,"""I know everything about you, David,"" he said, not offering his own name. ""I know that you are drowning in student loans. That you had to sell your car.",29,5

""You have a gun, and someone is kneeling in front of you,"" he said.",27,10

He leaned forward again. ""But what if you do?"" he said.",16,15

*This guy is insane,* I thought. ""You have the power?"" I asked, exasperated. ""If so, why not do it yourself?",30,16

""What you kill for is up to you,"" he said. ""You can receive anything you wish.""

I looked at my watch, then slumped back on the bench, overwhelmed. *What should I do?* I thought.",23,32

What is the worth of a life? Was it more lives?",30,33

1ptylpx,,I had never been so stressed in my entire life. I could barely think. I had to decide. I had to decide *now*.,23,41
1ptylpx,,I jumped up and started walking toward the alley. There was no choice. I had to do this.,18,42

1ptylpx,,"I would make sure they were remembered forever as a hero. Someone who saved the world. *Just do it. Keep walking.*

My legs were so heavy. *End a life.*

I struggled to keep moving. I was almost there. *I...",21,45

Ten feet from the alley, my legs gave out. I fell to my knees. Tears rolled down my face. I couldn't breathe.",25,46

1ptw3vo,,"The fireplace - maybe, Fireplace with a capital *F* was more appropriate - was a five-foot-tall monstrosity made of laminate wood, plastic stonework, and fake bricks with a little bit of faux moss artfully applied with green paint.",38,3

1ptw3vo,,"It came with a cord in the back to plug into the wall, which lit up a small pile of plastic logs at the base.",25,5

1ptw3vo,,"It looked like it came out of a Thomas Kinkade painting, if his work could somehow be more kitschy. I stepped forward and gave it an experimental tug.",28,7
1ptw3vo,,"It slid a bit out of the back, but not much. “Did this thing get bigger after we left the store?” I asked.",23,8
1ptw3vo,,"“Maybe we can get Misty to help.” Meredith joked. I turned to see our cat in the window, watching us with boredom.",22,9
1ptw3vo,,She flicked an ear and raised her leg to begin licking her paw. “Lucky girl.,15,10

“The sooner you stop stalling, the sooner we can join her! It’ll be easy.",29,11

1ptw3vo,,"“Ok...one…two...three...GO!”

I tugged with all my might while she put all her weight forward. It slid out much faster and easier than we’d thought. It was heavier on the bottom.",30,14
1ptw3vo,,"I yelled in surprise and rolled to the right, barely missing having my stomach caved in, as it tumbled out and landed upright on the driveway with a loud crash.",30,15
1ptw3vo,,"In doing so, something that had been stuck inside the chimney came loose, dropping out and skittering across the concrete to land near my hand. “Matt!",26,16
1ptw3vo,,Are you okay?” Meredith rushed around the side of the car. I gave her a small wave from my position. She laughed.,22,17
1ptw3vo,,“I thought I was going to have a lonely Christmas.” She looked down.,13,18
1ptw3vo,,"“What is that?”

It was a cardboard box, wrapped in paper decorated with snowflakes and tied with a red ribbon.",20,19

1ptw3vo,,"“I thought presents were supposed to go under the tree, not up the chimney.” I said, getting back to my feet and giving the box a shake. Something rattled inside.",30,21

1ptw3vo,,"I wonder if…”

Before I could stop her, Meredith snatched it out of my hands and began ripping at the paper eagerly. “I just *love* cool thrift stuff like this!",30,23
1ptw3vo,,"Little reminders of the people things used to belong to.”

Within seconds, she had pulled off the ribbon and eagerly opened the lid.",23,24
1ptw3vo,,"The look of excitement on her face slowly drained. Puzzled, I peeked inside and frowned. It was a shoe, a child’s sneaker too dirty and roughed up to be new.",30,25

She giggled and bent down to pick up one side, letting the shoe drop to the driveway.",27,31
1ptw3vo,,"As we carried the Fireplace into the house, I stared glumly at it. What a rotten present to give to a kid. —

Meredith took to the Fireplace immediately.",29,32
1ptw3vo,,She had me move the tree out of its usual place in the corner to make room for it.,19,33
1ptw3vo,,"In a frenzy of stockings, garlands, and cards, she had the whole thing decked out in under half an hour.",20,34
1ptw3vo,,“And now for the piece de resistance…” she climbed eagerly behind it and plugged the cord into the wall.,19,35
1ptw3vo,,"The plastic logs roared to life…or rather, feebly lit up with just enough glow to be disappointing.",17,36
1ptw3vo,,"But she’d strung lights around the mantle, and our stockings hung there, bathed slightly in the orange glow. When Meredith stepped back out and saw the whole thing, she sighed.",30,37
1ptw3vo,,"“Awww, it reminds me of my grandma’s fireplace. She used to decorate it like this every Christmas.” 

I had to admit, it did look charming.",25,38
1ptw3vo,,"At least in its total affront to good taste. But if it made her happy, it made me happy. “Now we can decorate it every year, too.",27,39
1ptw3vo,,"Start a new tradition.”

Meredith smiled and leaned up to kiss me.",12,40

I reached in my pocket for my phone when we heard a rattling.",17,43
1ptw3vo,,"Misty hissed and jumped back as a second present, this time with green paper, came tumbling out of the chimney and landed haphazardly in front of the Fireplace.",28,44
1ptw3vo,,"With a yowl, Misty bolted and disappeared down the hallway. “Uh…guess there was one more in there.” I snatched it up and handed it to Meredith. “Things come in pairs.",30,45
1ptw3vo,,"One shoe for the other?” 

She began tearing at the paper. “Maybe the previous owners put the receipt inside somewhere. We could try to find them.",26,46
1ptw3vo,,Maybe these were special presents they forgot about before donating it.” She lifted the lid off and somehow frowned deeper than she had with the first gift. “What?,28,47
1ptw3vo,,"Did Bobby have Athlete’s foot or something?” I peeked inside and frowned as well. It was a pair of glasses, for a kid given the size.",26,48
1ptw3vo,,The right lens was cracked nearly in half. The left was missing altogether.,13,49
1ptw3vo,,"“Matt, I don’t like this.” Meredith put the box down and began looking around the edges of the fireplace.",19,50
1ptw3vo,,"“People usually write their names on larger things they own, right?”

I stepped up and put my hands on her shoulders.",21,51
1ptw3vo,,"“If it’s freaking you out that much, we can just take it back to the store.” We both stepped back and looked at the decorations festooning the Fireplace.",28,52
1ptw3vo,,"They seemed inadequate now, frivolous, even, to cover up what was really just an ugly hunk of wood and plastic. Meredith obviously thought differently. “But it looks so nice!",29,53
1ptw3vo,,Can we at least keep it up until Mom and Dad come to visit next week?,16,54
1ptw3vo,,"Then we can take it back, I promise.”

I didn’t have the heart at the moment to tell her I’d thrown the receipt away. But no matter.",27,55
1ptw3vo,,"I would cart it off in the car, slap a *FREE* sign on it, and leave it somewhere in town. “Sure, babe.",22,56
1ptw3vo,,"Anything you want.”

And we stood there, wrapped in each other’s arms, as the lights twinkled.",16,57
1ptw3vo,,"—-

We had gotten the Fireplace on a chance Thursday night trip to the thrift store, so the next day we had to work.",24,58

1ptw3vo,,"“What is it, girl? Are you waiting for Santa to come down with some Fancy Feast?”

I looked over and froze.",21,62
1ptw3vo,,"There was another present, in blue wrapping, lying in front of the Fireplace. Like the other two, the paper was ripped in the corners and looked old.",27,63
1ptw3vo,,I snatched it up and turned it over. “What the hell?” I said to no one in particular.,18,64
1ptw3vo,,"“How many presents can fit up that chimney?”

I set it on the coffee table and got on my hands and knees, torso inside the Fireplace.",26,65
1ptw3vo,,The tightness of my slacks as I awkwardly turned to reach up reminded me not to indulge so much this holiday. Maybe even start the new years’ resolutions early.,29,66
1ptw3vo,,"I expected my hand to hit a wall of plastic only a foot or two inside the chimney, but to my surprise, it kept going.",25,67
1ptw3vo,,"I grunted and repositioned, trying to reach up further. Despite the extra length, I still didn’t feel an end.",19,68
1ptw3vo,,"Oddly, the air seemed colder on my hands the further up I reached. There was enough room to get off my knees.",22,69
1ptw3vo,,"The areas I was touching felt strange, rougher, harder than they should have been.",14,70
1ptw3vo,,"I thought I would have enough space to stand up completely, but I finally hit the top of the chimney. I gave it a few experimental pushes. It felt solid.",30,71
1ptw3vo,,"I tried to see by the light of the room seeping in from the bottom, but it was surprisingly dark. Well, I hadn’t collided with any more presents.",28,72
1ptw3vo,,"That had to be the last of them. Just to be sure, I began to feel around the top.",19,73
1ptw3vo,,"Who knows, maybe the previous owners \**had*\* stuck the receipt up here. My fingers brushed on the edge of something. I frowned. It almost felt like a slot.",28,74
1ptw3vo,,"I pushed my fingertips in and pulled. It gave slightly, almost like the hinge on a trapdoor.",17,75
1ptw3vo,,"In doing so, a puff of air, colder than it had any right to be, ran over my fingers. Goosebumps went down my arms. What was this thing? “Babe!",29,76
1ptw3vo,,"Have you seen my necklace? I think I left it in the kitchen.” 

Judging by the muffled quality of Meredith’s voice, she was still upstairs.",25,77
1ptw3vo,,"I let the slot close again and crouched, quickly backing out of the Fireplace. For some reason, I didn’t want her to see me peeking up there.",27,78
1ptw3vo,,"Misty had apparently lost interest and took to staring wide-eyed at the lights that adorned the tree. “Uh, I don’t know. One second!” I quickly snatched up the present.",29,79
1ptw3vo,,The glasses and shoes had been bad enough; I didn’t want to know what was in there. Much less for Meredith to find out there had been another one.,29,80
1ptw3vo,,"“Hang on, I’m coming!” I heard her steps descending the stairs.",11,81
1ptw3vo,,"Without thinking, I jammed the present under the couch and had just enough time to dart into the kitchen before she came down.",23,82
1ptw3vo,,The necklace was on the counter next to the coffee pot. “Found it.” I said sheepishly. She smiled and turned her back so I could fasten it.,27,83
1ptw3vo,,“How did Misty like the Fireplace? Has she found a new scratching post?” We’d lost a few pieces of furniture to her restless claws.,24,84
1ptw3vo,,"“No, she doesn’t seem to mind it, actually.” I lied. She turned around and smiled. “C’mon.",16,85
1ptw3vo,,"The sooner we start the day the sooner it’ll be over.” We left the tree on for Misty. As we stepped out the door, I glanced back at the fireplace.",30,86
1ptw3vo,,"Only another week. —--

Meredith’s office was closer, so she usually got home first despite both our days ending at 4:30.",21,87
1ptw3vo,,"As I drove through town, past the shop windows covered in fake snow and garlands, I began to feel uneasy.",20,88
1ptw3vo,,"Some Christmas song was on the radio, but I shut it off. I couldn’t put my finger on what felt wrong.",21,89
1ptw3vo,,"I got my answer when I walked in the door. Meredith stood near the Fireplace, another present in her hands. Her coat and bag lay forgotten on the couch.",29,90
1ptw3vo,,"I had a moment of fear that she’d found the one I’d hidden this morning, but the paper was different.",20,91
1ptw3vo,,"Instead of blue trees with yellow lights, a pattern of red, green, and gold decorated it. The momentary relief that had washed over me was replaced with confusion.",28,92
1ptw3vo,,There hadn’t been any more presents up the chimney. I’d checked.,11,93
1ptw3vo,,“This was in front of the Fireplace when I came home.” She sounded like she was trying to stop from panicking. Her hands trembled slightly as she held it out.,30,94
1ptw3vo,,"“What the hell is going on, Matt?” 

“I…I…uh…” I struggled for words. Before I could stop her she began tearing furiously at the paper.",24,95
1ptw3vo,,"“Where the fuck do these keep coming from? Oh God, I don’t want to do this…” she ripped away the last of the paper and opened the lid.",28,96
1ptw3vo,,She recoiled like she’d been shocked and threw it to the carpet with a cry. The object inside bounced out and rolled across the carpet towards me.,27,97
1ptw3vo,,"It was a tie, an orange paisley necktie that had been torn to shreds.",14,98
1ptw3vo,,Only the carefully tied knot at the center of the loop kept the loose strands of fabric from falling away. A few long black hairs were tangled among the folds.,30,99
1ptw3vo,,"“There’s something wrong with this thing, Matt.” Meredith began tearing down the lights she’d tied around the mantle and throwing the Christmas cards to the ground.",26,100
1ptw3vo,,“I don’t want it in our house anymore.,8,101
1ptw3vo,,"Whoever owned this had a sick fucking sense of humor.”

For some reason, I thought of the slot I’d felt up the chimney that morning and got an idea.",29,102
1ptw3vo,,"Maybe the look of joy on her face when she’d finished setting it up yesterday inspired me. “Babe. Babe, wait.” She stopped her destruction and turned to look.",28,103
1ptw3vo,,"“Maybe there’s an explanation for all this.”

She stepped back. I got on my hands and knees again and started crawling inside the Fireplace.",24,104
1ptw3vo,,"“What are you doing?” she asked, with a slight edge of worry in her voice.",15,105
1ptw3vo,,I got back in the semi-crouched position I’d taken that morning and felt around for the slot. My fingers found purchase and I tugged.,24,106
1ptw3vo,,"The cold air that shouldn’t have been there hit my hands again, but I ignored it as the compartment opened.",20,107
1ptw3vo,,I extended my arm as far as it could go down the new hole and felt around. Something with a cornered edge hit my palm.,25,108
1ptw3vo,,"“Merry, go around to the back of this thing.” I was sure my voice sounded muffled to her. “Why?” 

“Just do it.",22,109
1ptw3vo,,"I think I know the source of our mystery presents.” 

I heard her clamber around to the back of the fireplace.",21,110
1ptw3vo,,"“And what, exactly, am I looking for?”

“I don’t know, some kind of door or hatch or something.”

A few seconds passed before as a second source of light came spilling out of the small compartment door.",37,111
1ptw3vo,,"I looked in to see a row of presents, all in their own cubbyholes, arranged around some kind of chained track.",21,112
1ptw3vo,,My had was inches away from a grabbing mechanism and the motorized hinge of the compartment.,16,113
1ptw3vo,,"Meredith’s voice was clearer and closer, so I knew she was speaking through the hatch she’d found above. “Holy crap!",20,114
1ptw3vo,,"What the hell is this thing?”

“I think I know.” I said. “It’s a gimmick.",15,115
1ptw3vo,,You put presents in the back and this system moves them around and drops them from the chimney for you.,20,116
1ptw3vo,,"The parents can say, ‘Look, Santa is sending you one early’. It’s a thing for kids.”

There was relief in her voice when she spoke again. “Oh, thank God.",29,117
1ptw3vo,,"I thought they were coming from a wormhole or something.”

I closed the door and retreated out of the fireplace. Meredith was already taking the presents out of the back.",30,118
1ptw3vo,,"“I guess the parents forgot to take these out before donating it.” She gleaned up. “Well, don’t just stand there.",20,119
1ptw3vo,,"Help me get these out.”

—-

There were six more presents altogether, each wrapped in a different style of paper.",20,120
1ptw3vo,,"Given the glasses, shoe, and tie from earlier we weren’t expecting toys as we unwrapped them. But each passing “gift” only made us more uneasy.",25,121
1ptw3vo,,"It made for an odd, disquieting tableau once we laid them all out on the coffee table. A woman’s red sweater, torn at the left shoulder.",26,122
1ptw3vo,,"A pair of house keys. The missing lens from the pair of glasses. An empty wallet. A broken necklace, box full of separated links.",24,123
1ptw3vo,,"And, worst of all, a dried, bloody band-aid wrapped with a crusty piece of gauze. “Who the hell were these people?” Meredith asked, leaning back onto the couch.",28,124
1ptw3vo,,"“There’s no way any of these were meant as real gifts, even as a white elephant.",16,125
1ptw3vo,,What’s the point of buying something like that if you’re only going to have it dispense \**this\** stuff?,18,126
1ptw3vo,,"And they went to all the trouble of wrapping it all in different paper, too.”

“I don’t know.",18,127
1ptw3vo,,"Some people just aren’t right, I guess.” It was an inadequate explanation, but it was all I dared to think at the moment.",23,128
1ptw3vo,,"“Well, first thing tomorrow we’re taking it right back to the sore. Let someone else take this creep’s holiday memorabilia home.” She began gathering up the wrapping paper.",28,129
1ptw3vo,,"My eyes drifted over to the Fireplace and I noticed, for the first time, the scratch marks down the side. The wood and plastic stonework was slashed in multiple places.",30,130
1ptw3vo,,Especially around the base. The glowing logs had a number done on them as well. “Looks like Misty used it as a scratching post after all.,26,131
1ptw3vo,,She doesn’t like it either. One more reason to get rid of it.” I said. Meredith stopped cleaning up and looked troubled. “Have you seen her since we got home?,30,132
1ptw3vo,,"She usually comes to the door when I come in, but she didn’t tonight.” 

Now that I thought about it, I hadn’t.",22,133
1ptw3vo,,"She usually came to supervise whatever we were doing in the living room in the evenings, but there was neither hide nor hair or our gray furball.",27,134
1ptw3vo,,"The next thing I knew, we were going all around the house, looking under chairs, in the bathroom, and inside the kitchen cabinets.",23,135
1ptw3vo,,I tried calling her name a few times before realizing she wasn’t a dog.,14,136
1ptw3vo,,"As evening turned to night and we ran out of places to search, Meredith grew more frantic. “Maybe she slipped out when I was coming in the door.",28,137
1ptw3vo,,I was checking a text from work and could’ve missed her. Or maybe she’s stuck somewhere!,16,138
1ptw3vo,,"Oh God, Matt, what if she got inside the walls?”

I tried to calm her down. “Babe, it’s okay. Cats just disappear like this sometimes.",25,139
1ptw3vo,,Maybe she’s holding us being away all day against us particularly hard today. She’ll turn up.,16,140
1ptw3vo,,"Look, why don’t we sit down and watch a movie?”

Meredith only agreed to this plan if we set Misty’s food dish on the ground beside the couch.",28,141
1ptw3vo,,"At every commercial break she shook the bowl, hoping the sound would attract her.",14,142
1ptw3vo,,"But as *Love Actually* reached the final airport scene, it was clear she’d stopped paying attention long ago.",18,143
1ptw3vo,,"“I just don’t know where she could have gone.”

I turned off the TV and started unplugging the lights. Truth be told, I was starting to lose hope too.",29,144
1ptw3vo,,"But as we walked towards the stairs, I tried one more time to assure her. “This is her home. If she got outside somehow, she’d find her way back.",29,145
1ptw3vo,,"I’m sure she’ll be scratching on the front door anytime now if it comes to that.”

I glanced back at the scratches on the Fireplace one last time.",28,146
1ptw3vo,,"Misty had been right, of course. Animals have a sixth sense like that.",13,147
1ptw3vo,,"—--

I was woken up around 8:00 the next morning by a box being thrown onto my stomach.",18,148
1ptw3vo,,"“Wha…?” I was still half asleep, trying to process what was happening, when Meredith’s voice, angry and demanding, cut through the fog.",22,149
1ptw3vo,,"“Is this a joke, Matthew?”

I blinked a few times and sat up. It took me a second to process what was in my lap.",25,150
1ptw3vo,,"Another gift, this one a swirling design of purple snowflakes. The paper was torn away and the lid was off.",20,151
1ptw3vo,,“I found that in front of the Fireplace when I went to make coffee. Did you sneak downstairs and wrap this in the middle of the night?,27,152
1ptw3vo,,"I looked inside the box and my blood ran cold. I put a shaky hand inside and pulled out Misty’s collar, the red one with blue stripes.",27,153
1ptw3vo,,"Her name tag glinted in the sunlight that streamed through the window. “What? What are you talking about?” I turned to look at Meredith, who continued her death glare.",29,154
1ptw3vo,,"“It was wrapped and everything. What happened to Misty, Matt? Did you find her and think this would be cute? Because it’s not. Especially involving the Fireplace.",27,155
1ptw3vo,,"Where is she?”

“I have no idea where this came from. I slept the whole night through. Merry, you have to believe me.” 

But it was obvious she didn’t.",29,156
1ptw3vo,,"She began tearing through the bedroom, looking under the bed and throwing the closet apart. “Uh huh. And I suppose it just materialized in front of the Fireplace?",28,157
1ptw3vo,,We took everything out of it. It was empty.,9,158
1ptw3vo,,"Look, just tell me where she is so we can get on with our day.”

We continued arguing, her accusing me of hiding Misty, and me trying to defend myself.",30,159
1ptw3vo,,The words got more heated and our voices louder. I ended up going downstairs and collapsing on the couch while she went into the bathroom and slammed the door.,29,160
1ptw3vo,,"She’d left a Kenny G Christmas album playing on the stereo. As the gooey saxophone ripples started to melt my brain, something came to me.",25,161
1ptw3vo,,"I got up and eyed the Fireplace again. The scratches in the plastic were deep, deeper than I thought.",19,162
1ptw3vo,,"And given the location of scratched-off pieces, Misty’s claws had dragged…from inside the Fireplace. There was a bit of her gray fur on top of the logs.",27,163
1ptw3vo,,I climbed behind it and opened the hatch. Just as I’d expected the slots were empty. All six. It clicked then. There had been six presents for six slots.,29,164
1ptw3vo,,"That’s all that could fit in there. Where had the other four come from? The shoe, the glasses, the one under the couch, and especially Misty’s collar?",27,165
1ptw3vo,,My thoughts were interrupted by the bedroom door slamming. I peeked out from behind the Fireplace to see Meredith coming down the stairs two at a time.,27,166
1ptw3vo,,Her keys jangled in her hand. “I’m going out for a while. Maybe I’ll stop by Mom and Dad’s.,19,167
1ptw3vo,,"Please, when I get back, stop the jokes.”

Before I could get a word in edgewise, the door slammed behind her.",21,168
1ptw3vo,,"The next thing I knew, I was rummaging around under the couch. It somehow looked worse than the previous morning.",20,169
1ptw3vo,,"The paper was more tattered, and the ribbon practically falling off. I tore off the lid and peered inside. It was almost funny.",23,170
1ptw3vo,,"A dog collar, with little mistletoes decorating it. I read the name *Benny* on the tag. I glanced up. The interior of the Fireplace looked darker than I remembered.",29,171
1ptw3vo,,I couldn’t even see the back wall behind the logs.,10,172
1ptw3vo,,"With a loud thump, another present came falling out of the chimney, tumbling over itself and landing next to the coffee table. Something snapped in me then.",27,173
1ptw3vo,,"I don’t know if it was leftover adrenaline from the fight between Meredith and I, the sheer impossibility of it all, or the fact I missed my cat.",28,174
1ptw3vo,,"Before I could stop myself, I was on my hands and knees and crawling inside the fireplace.",17,175
1ptw3vo,,"I was slow in raising myself up, crouching slightly to not hit my head on the top of the chimney.",20,176
1ptw3vo,,"I barely registered I was now standing at my full height before feeling around in the darkness for a second hatch, another compartment to put more presents in.",28,177
1ptw3vo,,"But as the cool, almost Arctic air draped down my shoulders, I was increasingly aware that was an impossibility.",19,178
1ptw3vo,,"My finger pricked on something sharp and I drew back in surprise, banging my elbow on the opposite wall. I reached up again in the gloom and yanked it out.",30,179
1ptw3vo,,It was one of Misty’s claws. It had to be. Embedded inside the chimney. A few rows up the fake stones was what appeared to be a fingernail.,28,180
1ptw3vo,,"I spotted a second and third, jutting out from the cracks, as I gazed upward.",15,181
1ptw3vo,,"The chimney continued, well past where it should have stopped, plastic stonework looking more like real masonry, until the shaft disappeared into darkness.",23,182
1ptw3vo,,"From somewhere high above, I heard a meow. “Misty!?” I cried, momentarily forgetting what a terrible situation I’d gotten myself in.",21,183
1ptw3vo,,"The meow came again, and I detected movement just on the edge of the shadows.",15,184
1ptw3vo,,"If I squinted just right, it looked like a cat’s tail, swinging in a slow, lazy arc. “Misty! That’s it, girl!",21,185
1ptw3vo,,"Come on down!” I stretched up on my tiptoes and reached as far up as I could. When my fingers touched the fur, I registered two things at once.",29,186
1ptw3vo,,"First, it was cold and stiff. Not like the warm softness of a cat at all.",16,187
1ptw3vo,,"Second, the tail had come down a bit too far out of the shadows and I saw what was on the end, holding it out like fishing lure.",28,188
1ptw3vo,,"A hand, old, ashen gray, and gnarled. For a moment, I thought I saw a white ruff and a red sleeve behind it.",23,189
1ptw3vo,,"In the seconds it took to process this, the hand dropped the tail and grasped mine, intertwining our fingers and digging its nails into my palm.",26,190
1ptw3vo,,"I screamed and tried to pull back, but the grip was like a vice. It began retreating upward, slowly taking me with it.",23,191
1ptw3vo,,"I batted at it weakly with my other hand and tried to grab at something to stop the ascent, but my fingers skated uselessly over the stones.",27,192
1ptw3vo,,"With mounting horror, I realized my feet were starting to leave the ground.",13,193
1ptw3vo,,"I swung my legs outwards, trying to hook one of them on the edge of the opening, but missed. The hand dug its nails in tighter.",26,194
1ptw3vo,,I felt blood well on my palm and start dripping down my arm. I swung again and managed to catch my foot on the edge.,25,195
1ptw3vo,,"Instantly a hot bolt of pain shot down my arm, concentrated in my wrist. I flexed my muscles and tried to hold it as long as I could.",28,196
1ptw3vo,,"Wildly looking down, I saw the severed tail lying next to the plastic logs, like a gray worm.",18,197
1ptw3vo,,"I swung my other foot and hooked that one as well, anchoring myself. The pain in my wrist was getting worse, mounting in intensity with each passing second.",28,198
1ptw3vo,,"Suddenly, a cool rush of air came upon me and something collided with my face. I cried out and nearly lost the leverage.",23,199
1ptw3vo,,"As it slid off and tumbled to the ground below, I barely had time to register a flash of red wrapping paper.",22,200
1ptw3vo,,"A barrage of presents came after that, falling from the pit above me, each one landing on my head, neck, or face.",22,201
1ptw3vo,,"My wrist felt like someone had poured molten lava on it. I looked, barely moving my head to avoid another falling gift, and looked at the thing grasping me.",29,202
1ptw3vo,,"I could see its fingertips beneath my skin, close to breaking through the back of my hand.",17,203
1ptw3vo,,"I felt my leverage start to loosen, the muscles in my legs starting to give out from the exertion. They began to relax slowly, slipping ever closer off the edge.",30,204
1ptw3vo,,My mind spun wildly and I thought of Meredith coming home to find a particularly large gift waiting for her. One foot slipped away.,24,205
1ptw3vo,,"I closed my eyes…

Suddenly, my whole arm was struck by a bolt of pain.",15,206
1ptw3vo,,"I let out another involuntary scream and the blood that was trickling down suddenly became a river, splattering down onto my face.",22,207
1ptw3vo,,"With a sickening *crack*, the pressure suddenly let go and I was falling.",13,208
1ptw3vo,,"The thing had something in its grip, pale and dripping, as it suddenly vanished upwards into the shadows.",18,209
1ptw3vo,,"I hit the ground and rolled to the side, banging my head on the plastic logs. Breathing heavily, I dragged myself out of the fireplace, leaving a wet trail behind.",30,210
1ptw3vo,,"The presents were soaked with red. Several more come down the chimney. I dialed on my phone, staining the screen, and set it on the coffee table.",27,211
1ptw3vo,,"The pain in my wrist had intensified to such a degree I didn’t feel it anymore. Ignoring my slippery fingers, I reached for the nearest present.",26,212
1ptw3vo,,I barely registered Meredith’s voice.,5,213
1ptw3vo,,"“Well, are you ready to give up on the charade?”

I tore at the paper, but it wasn’t going fast enough, so I ripped the ribbon off with my teeth.",30,214
1ptw3vo,,"I spat it out and lifted the lid. “I found Misty. Misty’s here. She was in the Fireplace the whole time.”

Inside the box was a severed finger.",28,215
1ptw3vo,,A wedding ring sparkled just above the knuckle. “They’re here too. The previous owners.,14,216
1ptw3vo,,"No trouble getting a hold of them now.”

Gifts were still tumbling out of the fireplace, making a large pile that buried the logs. I tore open another one.",29,217
1ptw3vo,,"An eyeball, dry, the blue of the iris faded to a murky gray. “Matt. Matt. What are you talking about? You sound insane.",23,218
1ptw3vo,,"Are you okay?”

“Just fine!” I cried, tearing the lid off another. An entire set of dog’s teeth, rattling inside the box like a snake.",25,219
1ptw3vo,,"“You have fun…I’ll stay here and open everything!”

The next box was bigger than the others, and heavier.",18,220
1ptw3vo,,"A few long dark hairs hanging out the end of the lid clued me as to what was inside. “What? Matt, please…” but I hung up.",26,221
1ptw3vo,,"That was about twenty minutes ago. There’s been several more calls but I’ve ignored them all. The presents continue to drop down the chimney, about one a minute.",28,222
1ptw3vo,,"It’s hard to tear the paper and arrange things with only one hand. But I’m managing. It’s easy to follow, like putting a Lego set together. Piece after piece.",29,223
1ptw3vo,,"Pretty soon I’ll have the whole family laid out here on the floor. Mom, Dad, Bobby, and Benny. And Misty! Won’t Merry be pleased to have her back?",28,224
1ptw3vo,,The gifts are starting to make quite a mountain. Lots of them are dripping. The carpet is soaked and matted. It’s making a terrible mess.,25,225
1ptw3vo,,I hope I finish before these black spots at the corners of my eyes go away.,16,226
1ptu5lt,My car picked up a stray signal,"I was driving out one night, deep in the sticks. Through a patch of dead air.",16,0
1ptu5lt,,"The monotony of the road and the static of my car's radio lulled me, as my eyes felt heavier and heavier.",21,1
1ptu5lt,,"I was staring up at the stars through drooping eyes, when my ears were pierced by a deafening sound emanating from the radios. A cacophony of human screaming.",28,2
1ptu5lt,,"So many people, begging for help. I veered to the side of the road, completely caught off guard. Just as it had come it ended.",25,3
1ptu5lt,,"Leaving me in near silence as the radio quietly hummed. I went home that night, and as I lay there, unable to sleep, I thought about what had happened.",29,4
1ptu5lt,,I wondered if I had picked up a stray signal from someone who needed help. The next day I went back to the spot.,24,5
1ptu5lt,,Guided by the screaming that projected from the radio. I had come prepared in case someone out there was injured.,20,6
1ptu5lt,,I'd also brought a portable radio determined to follow the signal to its source. So I did. I followed it as it got louder and louder.,26,7
1ptu5lt,,"Until I reached its source. A large craterous hole in the ground. I could hear soft cries coming from within. Horrified, I now knew someone was injured down there.",29,8
1ptu5lt,,I had to help them. So I tied a rope to a nearby tree and began my descent into its depths.,21,9
1ptu5lt,,"The cave was humid and wet, water dripped down from the ceiling. The air was filled with a metallic smell, like corroded pennies.",23,10
1ptu5lt,,"A breeze ran through the cave, carrying with it an orchestral symphony of agony. I began to walk deeper when I walked on something that clinked.",26,11
1ptu5lt,,It was a set of keys with a tag that read 'Apartment Building 426' followed by an address. From a city that I knew did not exist.,27,12
1ptu5lt,,As I walked deeper in. I soon found where the screams and moans of agony were coming from.,18,13
1ptu5lt,,"At least a dozen people were fused into the walls, ceiling and floor of the cave.",16,14
1ptu5lt,,"One man was completely fused into the stone wall, his face frozen in an expression of terror.",17,15
1ptu5lt,,I still remember the horrible sound of grinding stone on stone as his eyes shifted to meet me.,18,16
1ptu5lt,,"There were others half fused to the stone walls crying in pain for help; some had limbs missing. Perfectly cut off, in single straight edges. There was no blood.",29,17
1ptu5lt,,Although the stumps did not seem to be cauterized. One man was on the floor in a fetal position. Half of him was sunken in.,25,18
1ptu5lt,,"Half his face looked up at me and he began to speak to me in barely legible words. “You have to help us, please for the love of god.",29,19
1ptu5lt,,"Please.”

His pained murmuring quickly grew into a frantic screaming. “MY WIFE, WHERE'S MY WIFE? YOU HAVE TO HELP HER.",20,20
1ptu5lt,,"YOU HAVE TO SAVE HER.”

When he went quiet again, a woman's voice called out a name from the depths of the cave. When he heard it.",27,21
1ptu5lt,,They both erupted in agonizing wails. It was the sound of two people who’d had the last of their hope stripped away from them.,24,22
1ptu5lt,,"An animalistic pained sobbing that echoed on the cavern's walls. His arm shot up clamping down on my leg painfully. ""You have to get me out, I can't go back.",30,23
1ptu5lt,,"Please. Don't let me go back.""

I grabbed his arm and his skin shifted under my grip like wet clay. I pulled but he would not budge.",27,24
1ptu5lt,,"I pulled

And pulled. His arm's socket popped wetly as it dislocated, and his arm tore off like wet paper.",20,25
1ptu5lt,,"When his arm gave way I fell backwards, smashing my head against a stone and passing out. I woke up and the cave was silent.",25,26
1ptu5lt,,I was the only one there. So I climbed out and called the police.,14,27

**1930:** *Subject entered REM sleep. The Third Floor moved into the crawlspace above Subject’s bedroom.* 
**2100:** *Subject is staring at this log.",30,10

1ptny99,,"The 'Janitor' does not like to be watched while he cleans the blood.*

I heard it then. The unmistakable, rhythmic *whir-slap, whir-slap* of an industrial floor buffer.",27,15
1ptny99,,"It was coming from my hallway—the one with the hardwood floors I just waxed last week. I grabbed my phone to call 1SG, but the screen didn't show my wallpaper.",30,16
1ptny99,,It was a live feed of my own kitchen.,9,17

I didn't think. I dropped the pistol. It wouldn't work against a ghost anyway. Then, I ran.",27,30

The floor buffer shrieked, a sound like a human scream.",30,33
1ptny99,,"The 'Janitor', a shadow taller than the ceiling, bloomed behind Miller. I felt a searing heat, like the ""Heat Bloom"" from the parade field. I pulled out the Manila folder.",30,34

1ptny99,,"The smell of wax was gone, replaced by the scent of my cold coffee. Miller was slumped on my floor, breathing hard, his uniform back to normal. No cursive.",29,39
1ptny99,,"Just ""MILLER"" in standard block letters. He looked up at me, his eyes clearing. ""Um.. 'Sarnt? Where are we? I thought...",21,40

1ptk17q,,"He is the kind of dog that gets scared of his own farts and brings you a slipper when you get home, wagging his tail so hard his whole body wiggles along with it.",34,3
1ptk17q,,"It all started three days ago, on a Tuesday night. It was pouring rain.",14,4
1ptk17q,,One of those summer storms that knocks out the power and turns the dirt roads into mud pits.,18,5
1ptk17q,,"I was on the porch, smoking a cigarette and watching the rain, with Barnaby lying at my feet. Suddenly, he lifted his head. His ears went erect.",27,6
1ptk17q,,"The fur on his neck bristled. He was staring at the tree line, where the forest begins. It’s pitch black out there at night, but he saw something.",28,7
1ptk17q,,Barnaby let out a low growl. Not the playful growl he makes when we play tug-of-war.,16,8
1ptk17q,,"This was a guttural, vibrating sound that seemed to come from deep within his chest. It was Fear. “What is it, boy?” I asked, putting out my cigarette.",28,9
1ptk17q,,"Barnaby didn’t look at me. He was fixated on the darkness. And then, he did something he had never done before. He ran.",23,10
1ptk17q,,"He jumped the low porch railing and bolted toward the forest, barking furiously. “Barnaby! No! Get back here!” I screamed. But the thunder drowned out my voice.",27,11
1ptk17q,,"He vanished into the trees. I spent an hour calling him. I grabbed my flashlight and raincoat, stepping a bit into the woods. Nothing.",24,12
1ptk17q,,"The rain washed away any scent or tracks. I went back inside, soaked and worried. Domestic dogs don’t last long in the wild.",23,13
1ptk17q,,"There are snakes, cougars, and traps set by illegal poachers.",10,14
1ptk17q,,"I left the back door unlocked, put out a bowl of fresh food, and sat in the living room, waiting, listening to the rain on the roof.",27,15
1ptk17q,,I fell asleep on the couch. I woke up at 3:00 AM to a sound. Claws on the wooden floor. I jumped up. The back door was open.,28,16
1ptk17q,,"“Barnaby?”

He was in the kitchen, standing over his water bowl. Drinking, but... in a strange way. He wasn't lapping up the water noisily like he always did.",28,17
1ptk17q,,"Instead, he had his snout submerged in the water, motionless, as if he were absorbing the liquid by osmosis. I sighed with relief. “You idiot,” I walked over to him.",30,18
1ptk17q,,"“You scared me. Where did you go?”

He lifted his head. He was wet and covered in mud. There was a smell on his fur.",25,19
1ptk17q,,"Not the smell of wet dog. It smelled like overturned earth and something rotting—something sickly sweet. “Gross, Barnaby. Did you roll in a carcass?”

He didn’t wag his tail.",29,20
1ptk17q,,"He just looked at me. Golden Retrievers have brown, warm, expressive eyes. But Barnaby’s eyes were... opaque in that moment. There was a milky film over them.",27,21
1ptk17q,,"And he didn’t blink. He stared at me for ten whole seconds. Without moving a muscle. Without panting. “Come on, boy. Bath tomorrow.",23,22
1ptk17q,,"Bed now.” I pointed to his bed in the corner of the room. He didn’t move. “Bed!” I ordered, more firmly. Barnaby turned his body. Not in a fluid motion.",30,23
1ptk17q,,"It was a rigid movement. First the front paws, then the torso, then the back paws. Like a tank maneuvering. He went to his bed and lay down.",28,24
1ptk17q,,"But he didn’t curl up. He lay on his stomach, with all four legs stretched out and his head held high, staring at the wall.",25,25
1ptk17q,,"""He must be traumatized,"" I thought. ""He saw some animal in the woods and got spooked."" I locked the door and went to sleep. The next day, things got worse.",30,26
1ptk17q,,"The smell didn’t come out with the bath. And I bathed him with flea shampoo, scrubbing until my arms ached. But that smell seemed to emanate from beneath his skin.",30,27
1ptk17q,,"And the skin itself... While I was soaping him up, I felt that it was loose. Dogs have loose skin on their necks, I know. But this was different.",29,28
1ptk17q,,It felt like his skin was a suit one size too big for his body.,15,29
1ptk17q,,"When I pulled at his fur, the skin came away too easily, sliding over the muscles as if it weren't connected. And he was cold.",25,30
1ptk17q,,Dogs have a higher body temperature than humans. They are warm to the touch. Barnaby was freezing. Like a slab of steak taken out of the fridge.,27,31
1ptk17q,,"“You must be sick,” I murmured. “Hypothermia, maybe?”

I tried to give him a treat. He loved liver biscuits. I placed the biscuit in front of his nose.",28,32
1ptk17q,,"He sniffed it. Or pretended to sniff it. Then, he opened his mouth and let the biscuit fall inside. He didn’t chew.",22,33
1ptk17q,,"He just swallowed it whole, with a convulsive movement of his throat, like a snake swallowing an egg. I shivered all over.",22,34
1ptk17q,,"I spent the day working in my home office. Barnaby stayed in the hallway. He didn’t sleep. Every time I looked, he was there. Sitting... strangely. Too upright.",28,35
1ptk17q,,"His spine perfectly straight, his front legs stiffly extended. He looked like an Egyptian statue, not a normal dog. And... he was watching me.",24,36
1ptk17q,,"Whenever I turned my head quickly, he was staring. But as soon as our eyes met, he would look away at the floor. As if he were... dissembling.",28,37
1ptk17q,,"That night, I called my ex-girlfriend, Clara, who is a vet. “Clara, Barnaby is acting weird. He’s cold, his skin is loose, he’s not eating right.",26,38
1ptk17q,,"And he’s looking at me funny,” I said, worried. “Did he vomit? Have diarrhea?” she asked. “No. He just... doesn’t act like he used to.",25,39
1ptk17q,,"He seems like a robot.”

“It must be PTSD if he ran into the woods. Or he might have eaten a poisonous toad. Bring him here tomorrow morning,” she said.",30,40
1ptk17q,,"“Okay. I’ll bring him.”

“Oh, and David...” she hesitated. “Lock him in the guest room tonight. In case he has rabies or some neurological condition, he might get aggressive.”

“Barnaby?",30,41
1ptk17q,,"Aggressive? He’s afraid of butterflies, Clara.”

“Just for safety.”

I hung up. I looked at the hallway. Barnaby wasn’t there anymore. “Boy?”

I went to the living room. Nothing. Kitchen.",30,42
1ptk17q,,Nothing. Then I heard a noise coming from the guest room. The sound of little paws on the floor. But the rhythm was wrong. It didn’t sound like four paws...,30,43
1ptk17q,,"it sounded like two, like human footsteps. I walked to the guest room door, which was ajar. I pushed it open slowly.",22,44
1ptk17q,,"The room was dark, lit only by the moonlight coming through the window. Barnaby was there. He was standing. Not resting on his hind legs to look out the window.",30,45
1ptk17q,,"Not jumping. He was standing. His hind legs were straight, the knees locked backward. His torso was upright. His front paws hung by his sides, limp, swaying slightly.",28,46
1ptk17q,,"He was facing away from me, looking into the wardrobe mirror. Watching himself. He tilted his head to the left. Then to the right.",24,47
1ptk17q,,"Then, he tried to lift one of his front paws. The toes of his paw moved. Not like dog paws, which are fused.",23,48
1ptk17q,,"The toes separated and stretched, making a grasping motion in the air. I heard a sound. A raspy whisper, coming from his throat. “Aaaarrrr... tuuurrr.”

My bladder let go.",29,49
1ptk17q,,I felt warm urine run down my leg. I didn’t scream. The terror was so absolute it stole my voice. I took a step back. The floorboard creaked.,28,50
1ptk17q,,"Barnaby’s head turned. Not his body. Just his head. It rotated almost 180 degrees, like an owl, to look at me over his shoulder.",24,51
1ptk17q,,"The neck twisted the loose skin like a wet rag. He smiled. Dogs seem to ""smile"" when they are panting, tongue out. This wasn’t that.",25,52
1ptk17q,,"The black lips pulled upward, revealing all his teeth, including the molars way in the back. The mouth opened too wide, tearing slightly at the corners. There was no tongue.",30,53
1ptk17q,,Just a black hole in his throat. I slammed the door shut. I ran to my room and locked the door. I pushed the dresser in front of it.,29,54
1ptk17q,,"I grabbed my phone. No signal. Yesterday’s storm must have knocked out the tower’s power again. I sat on the bed, clutching a baseball bat, shaking violently.",27,55
1ptk17q,,I heard footsteps in the hallway. Heavy footsteps. Bipedal. They stopped in front of my bedroom door. I heard the sound of his breathing through the wood.,27,56
1ptk17q,,"A wet, bubbling sound. And then, the doorknob turned. Slowly. The metal knob creaked. It turned left, then right. He was trying to open it. With his paws.",28,57
1ptk17q,,"“Go away!” I screamed. “Get out of my house!”

The movement of the doorknob stopped. Silence. Then, a voice. It wasn’t my voice. It wasn’t a movie monster voice.",29,58
1ptk17q,,"It was a collage of sounds. “Sit... Stay... Good boy... Walk?”

He was repeating the words I said to him. But the intonation was wrong.",25,59
1ptk17q,,"The syllables were cut and pasted, like a defective recorder. “David... biscuit... David... open.”

I started to cry. “You’re not Barnaby. What did you do to him?”

Silence again.",29,60
1ptk17q,,"Then, I heard a sound that broke my heart. The sound of Barnaby whining. That high-pitched little cry he made when he wanted into the room. “Huuuum... wooof...",28,61
1ptk17q,,"wooof...”

It sounded so real. For a second, I thought: Am I crazy? Is he hurt out there and I locked him out? But then the whine changed.",28,62
1ptk17q,,"It dropped in pitch. It became deep. It turned into a laugh. A dry, human laugh coming from a dog’s throat. He started throwing himself against the door.",28,63
1ptk17q,,"The door shook. The dresser slid a few inches. That animal weighed forty kilos, but the force with which he hit felt like a hundred.",25,64
1ptk17q,,"The wood of the door began to crack. I looked at the window. Second floor. If I jumped, I’d break my legs. But if I stayed... it could be worse.",30,65
1ptk17q,,"Suddenly, the sound stopped. The footsteps moved away. Going down the stairs. I went to the window and peeked, hiding behind the curtain. The front door of the house opened.",30,66
1ptk17q,,"The Thing that used to be my dog walked out. It walked on two legs, but grotesquely.",17,67
1ptk17q,,"The rear knees, which on dogs bend backward, were forced to bend forward, popping with every step. The golden torso shone under the moonlight.",24,68
1ptk17q,,"He walked to the middle of the lawn. And stopped. He looked up, at my window. Knowing I was watching. He raised his right front paw and... waved.",28,69
1ptk17q,,"A rigid, human wave. Then, he ran into the forest. But he didn’t run like a dog.",17,70
1ptk17q,,"He ran like a naked, deformed man, flailing his arms, disappearing into the darkness. I stayed awake until dawn.",19,71
1ptk17q,,"When the sun came up, I grabbed my car keys, the baseball bat, and went downstairs. The house smelled like rot.",21,72
1ptk17q,,"There were mud marks and a viscous slime on my bedroom doorknob, the stair railing, the fridge. The fridge was open. All the raw meat was gone.",27,73
1ptk17q,,The Styrofoam trays were torn on the floor. He ate everything. Including the plastic. I ran to the car.,19,74
1ptk17q,,"As I drove down the dirt road to get out of there, I saw something on the edge of the woods. I stopped the car. It was a collar.",29,75
1ptk17q,,"Barnaby’s red collar. It was lying on the ground, near a bush. And next to the collar... the rest. I won’t describe it in detail.",25,76
1ptk17q,,But what I found there wasn’t a whole dog. It was... the inside part. As if someone had taken off a dog suit and left the inside behind.,28,77
1ptk17q,,"The skin was gone. The head was gone. Only the muscles, organs, and bones remained, surgically clean. I vomited right there.",21,78
1ptk17q,,I got in the car and drove to the city. I went straight to the police. I told an edited version of the story.,24,79
1ptk17q,,"I said someone broke into my house, killed my dog, and threatened me. I didn’t mention the dog walking on two legs. They would have institutionalized me.",27,80
1ptk17q,,"The police went out there. They filed a report. They found Barnaby’s remains in the woods. “Probably a jaguar,” the sergeant said. “Or some psychopath.",25,81
1ptk17q,,"We’ll investigate.”

I never went back to that house. I’m living in an apartment in downtown Rio, on the 15th floor. I sold the house for half its value.",29,82
1ptk17q,,I thought I was safe here. But last night... last night I was in the elevator. Going up alone. The elevator stopped on the 4th floor. The door opened.,29,83
1ptk17q,,There was no one there. The hallway was empty. I was about to press the button to close the door when I heard it.,24,84
1ptk17q,,"Coming from the end of the dark corridor. That sound of two paws on the floor. I looked closely. Deep in the shadows, there was a silhouette.",27,85
1ptk17q,,"It wasn’t a dog. It looked like a man. A tall, thin man, wearing a long trench coat. But the way he was standing...",24,86
1ptk17q,,"The head tilted at an impossible angle. Arms too long, reaching past his knees. He was facing away. The hallway light flickered. The figure turned around.",26,87
1ptk17q,,I didn’t see the face. He was wearing a hood or a hat. But I saw the feet. He wasn’t wearing shoes. The feet were hairy.,26,88
1ptk17q,,"And they had black claws that clicked against the ceramic tiles. And as the elevator door started to close, I heard the voice. Not a bark.",26,89
1ptk17q,,"But my own voice, whispered, echoing through the empty hall:

“Good... boy.”

The door closed. I am locked in my apartment now. I pushed the fridge against the door.",29,90
1ptk17q,,"I hear them out there. It’s not just one. It seems he taught others. They are scratching at the door. Not at the bottom, where a dog would scratch.",29,91
1ptk17q,,They are scratching at the height of the peephole. They want to come in. And I don’t think they just want to bite me.,24,92
1ptk17q,,I think Barnaby learned to walk on two legs because dog skin was too limiting. He wants something with thumbs. He wants something that can open doors.,27,93
1ptk17q,,He wants my skin. If you have a dog... and he runs into the woods at night... Do not go after him. And if he comes back different...,28,94
1ptk17q,,if he looks at you for too long... if he seems to understand what you say a little too well... Lock the door. And pray.,25,95

1ptfnu0,,"I slung my camera around my neck. With the midday sun beating waves of dry heat against our backs, we hopped out of Theo’s Jeep and began exploring.",28,10
1ptfnu0,,"The town wasn’t much, but even from a distance, I could tell it was surprisingly pristine.",16,11
1ptfnu0,,"As Yasmin, Theo, and I walked down Wasichu’s singular street, a sense of awe embedded itself deep into my gut.",20,12
1ptfnu0,,"The Saloon’s porch was weathered, sure, but none of it was outright rotten. No holes, no obvious insects chewing through the wood, not one plank out of place.",28,13
1ptfnu0,,"The schoolhouse windows were caked with dust, but none of them were broken. We could even read the signs denoting which building was which.",24,14
1ptfnu0,,"By my estimation, the paint had to be more than a century old. It was incredible.",16,15
1ptfnu0,,Would’ve been even *more* incredible if Theo and Yasmin had the decency to fuck off somewhere else for a bit and leave me be.,24,16
1ptfnu0,,I couldn’t focus on taking good pictures.,7,17
1ptfnu0,,"There was Yasmin and her oral fixation with sunflower seeds, audibly shattering the shells between her teeth, sometimes discharging a red-tinged glob of spit into a napkin if one of the shards jabbed her gums and drew blood.",38,18
1ptfnu0,,"When she finished a bag, she always had another.",9,19
1ptfnu0,,"Theo often joked that if we were to get lost, rescuers could just follow the trail of blood, spit, and empty plastic bags to our exact location.",27,20
1ptfnu0,,Not to say he was any better. Just as obnoxious in a different way. The man couldn’t shut his damn mouth.,21,21
1ptfnu0,,"Always chattering, always joking, always filling the air with some sort of meaningless drivel. When Hailey’s mom passed, he couldn’t even keep his lips sealed for the whole funeral sermon.",30,22
1ptfnu0,,He just *had* to comment on the shape of her coffin.,11,23
1ptfnu0,,"Not even a quarter of the way through, he leaned over to me, whispering about how the edges were ""weirdly round"".",21,24
1ptfnu0,,"Like they were burying her inside a hollowed out torpedo. Before long, I’d reached my limit.",16,25
1ptfnu0,,"Told Theo and Yasmin I was going to splinter off on my own for a while. They were disappointed, but that was their business, not mine.",26,26

1ptfnu0,,"Ain’t a lot of white noise in the desert - a gust of wind singing through a sand dune here, a grasshopper chirping in some bluegrass there - but this was different.",32,28
1ptfnu0,,"The silence was pure. Oppressive. All-consuming. I was standing in front of a squat, windowless building. A shed, maybe. Couldn’t be sure. It was the only building without signage.",29,29
1ptfnu0,,"I twisted the doorknob. Didn’t open. My hand encountered a clunky resistance, like it was locked, but it couldn’t have been, because on the second try, it gave way.",29,30
1ptfnu0,,"The hinges didn’t creak. My boots didn’t thump against the floorboards. Everything remained silent. A red-orange flicker met my eyes, pulsing, pushing back against a hungry darkness. Candlelight, I think.",30,31
1ptfnu0,,That’s where my memories end for a while. I didn’t pass out or anything. The sensation was gentler. Seamless. Similar to falling asleep.,23,32

1ptfnu0,,"CLICK.* 

The shuttering lens of my precious camera. My memories resume after nightfall. The veil rises, and I’m staring at a red-orange flicker and an encroaching darkness.",27,35
1ptfnu0,,"At first, I thought I was still in the shed, but the scene had changed.",15,36
1ptfnu0,,"The flames were larger, more effervescent, and the darkness was dappled with a bright array of white pinpoints. A campfire below a clear night sky. Theo’s voice booms into focus.",30,37
1ptfnu0,,"“Jesus Christ, Hailey!",3,38
1ptfnu0,,"Remember what Valentina said when she circled this place on our map?”

Yasmin was curled into a ball on the opposite side of the fire, knees tucked against her chest, head buried in her thighs.",35,39
1ptfnu0,,"Theo was on his feet, gesturing wildly at Hailey, who was pacing so furiously that she was kicking up small clouds of sand in her wake.",26,40
1ptfnu0,,"“Yes, Theo, of course I do - “ 

“Then why the fuck did you sprint into town when we got here?",21,41
1ptfnu0,,"Valentina specifically said: ‘Look, don’t touch.’ That was the plan. We all agreed!",13,42
1ptfnu0,,"We’ll stop, get a few pictures - from a distance - and enjoy the fucking scenery.”

Hailey threw her hands in the air. “You *really* think the land is...what...cursed?",29,43
1ptfnu0,,*That’s* why your car won’t start? You sure it isn’t your complete lack of responsibility? Your *absolute* failure to *ever* take good care of anything?,25,44
1ptfnu0,,"I mean, give me a break, Theo.”

His pupils fell to the sand. Nascent tears shimmered against the roaring fire. “And you know what?",24,45
1ptfnu0,,"If we’re taking a stroll down memory lane, remind me - did I put a gun to your head and force you into Wasichu?”

My eyes swung back to Hailey.",30,46
1ptfnu0,,"Guess she could feel my gaze on her, because her attention flipped to me. “I’m sorry - something you’d like to add?”

I shook my head *no*.",27,47
1ptfnu0,,"“Then stop fucking staring at - “ 

Those were her last words. Hailey’s anger vanished. Her arms became limp.",19,48
1ptfnu0,,"The expression on her face turned vacant; every muscle relaxed, except the ones that controlled her eyes. Both were bulging, practically exploding from their sockets.",25,49
1ptfnu0,,"One eyelid retracted from view, rising so high that I couldn’t see it anymore, disappearing somewhere within her skull. The other hung halfway down.",24,50
1ptfnu0,,There was an indent above her lashes; a crescent from how hard her iris was pushing against the inside of the lid. There was a pause.,26,51
1ptfnu0,,"Then, all at once, her body reactivated. She started sprinting. Wide, endless circles around Yasmin, Theo, and me. “Hailey...w-what are you doing?” Yasmin whimpered. No response.",26,52
1ptfnu0,,"No change in her facial expression. “Jesus, what the fuck is wrong with you?” Theo said. She didn’t stop. She wouldn’t slow down. And I couldn’t pull my eyes away.",30,53
1ptfnu0,,Minutes passed. Our pleas fell on deaf ears. Her breathing became harsh. Sputtering wheezes spilled from her heaving rib cage.,20,54
1ptfnu0,,"Her head became flushed, swelled with blood until it was the color of a bruise; a deep, throbbing indigo.",19,55
1ptfnu0,,"My chest felt hot and heavy, like someone was ironing my breastbone. “Stop! Hailey, please, stop!” Yasmin screamed. Theo attempted to tackle her. He dove, but missed her waist.",29,56
1ptfnu0,,"His arms wrapped around her shins. Hailey tripped, and the ball of her left ankle slammed into the hard sand. A sickening crunch radiated through the atmosphere.",27,57
1ptfnu0,,"It barely slowed her pace. She ran on the mangled appendage like it was the most natural thing in the world. After Theo's attempt, Hailey changed her trajectory.",28,58
1ptfnu0,,"She sprinted into the darkness, straight forward, full steam ahead. The rhythmic snaps of shredding tissue got quieter, and quieter, and eventually, we couldn’t hear anything at all.",28,59
1ptfnu0,,Yasmin collapsed onto her side and began to softly weep.,10,60
1ptfnu0,,"Cross-legged, catatonic, Theo turned to me and asked:

“Why...why didn’t you try to help?”

I didn’t have an answer for him.",21,61
1ptfnu0,,"All of a sudden, Theo leapt into the Jeep and jammed his keys into the ignition. Tried to resurrect his car for nearly an hour, to no avail.",28,62
1ptfnu0,,"There was gas in the tank, and he could flick the headlights on and off, but the engine was stubbornly dead. The machinery refused to even make a sound.",29,63
1ptfnu0,,"At some point, exhaustion put us all to sleep. *CLICK. CLICK. CLICK. CLICK.* 

I awoke in a sitting position. My eyes were already open.",24,64
1ptfnu0,,"I could tell that Theo was still sleeping, but I wasn’t looking at him.",14,65
1ptfnu0,,"In the dim light of the waning fire, I could see Yasmin on her knees, hunched over, spine curled.",19,66
1ptfnu0,,"Both hands were darting between her mouth and the ground, over and over again. The scalding pressure against my chest returned.",21,67
1ptfnu0,,"An endless series of gritty *squeaks* emanated from her churning jaw. The noise was hellish, but quiet. Wasn’t loud enough to wake Theo on its own. Yasmin’s eyes were bulging.",30,68
1ptfnu0,,"One was half-concealed behind a paralyzed eyelid. The rest of her face was loose, abandoned, a mask that obscured everything but her eyes.",23,69
1ptfnu0,,She was eating anything that was in front of her. And I watched her do it. It was mostly sand. Handful after handful of grainy sediment.,26,70
1ptfnu0,,"That said, Yasmin held no culinary discriminations; nothing was off the menu. Sagebrush. A line of ants. A few beetles.",20,71
1ptfnu0,,"One small rodent I had trouble identifying before she shoved it into her waiting maw. Hell, I even saw her take a bite out of a tarantula.",27,72
1ptfnu0,,The injury wasn’t fatal. It skittered away on its remaining legs before she could deliver the killing blow. Her throat swelled. Her stomach expanded.,24,73
1ptfnu0,,"I think I heard a muted *pop*. Minutes later, she fell onto her back, mercifully still, finally full. I waited, seemingly unable to do anything else.",26,74
1ptfnu0,,"As dawn crested over the horizon, Theo woke up. He rubbed his eyes and saw me first: petrified, motionless, upright. Incrementally, I witnessed a gut-wrenching fear take hold of him.",30,75
1ptfnu0,,"He turned over, and was greeted by the sight of Yasmin’s bloated corpse bathing in a golden sunrise. Theo sprang to his feet.",23,76
1ptfnu0,,"His mouth opened wide like he was about to say something, chastise me for my indifference maybe, but that’s not what came out.",23,77
1ptfnu0,,"The fear evaporated, his one eye bulged, and only then did he begin. It was the single loudest scream I had ever heard.",23,78
1ptfnu0,,"And, God, to my abject horror, it just kept going. Seconds turned to minutes. The noise became shrill, crackling every so often. My ears began to ring. The valley brightened.",30,79
1ptfnu0,,Minutes accumulated. A gurgle crept into the scream. Blood trickled down the corners of his mouth.,16,80
1ptfnu0,,His lips turned the color of day’s old snow: the ashy white-blue of dirty slush piled high on the edges of busy streets.,23,81
1ptfnu0,,"After about an hour, he choked, I think. Or he died from blood loss. The cause doesn’t matter. He collapsed, and it was finally over.",25,82
1ptfnu0,,"I stood, walked over to Theo’s Jeep, and climbed in the driver’s seat. With my camera still slung around my neck, I turned the keys. The engine growled to life.",30,83
1ptfnu0,,"I drove home. Eight days later, I’ve been cleared as a suspect. The coroner examined the bodies. It’s evident that I didn’t lay a finger on any of them.",29,84
1ptfnu0,,"I know better, though. I may not have touched them, but I’m not blameless. The last four pictures on my camera proved it.",23,85
1ptfnu0,,"Didn’t mean much to the police when they saw them, but it's meant everything to me. One shows the door of that shed swinging open.",25,86
1ptfnu0,,"The next shows a black box on the floor, the front engraved with orante gold symbology, surrounded by lit candles.",20,87
1ptfnu0,,"The third is closer to the box, and the lid is up, revealing a necklace perched atop red satin. Two small, violet gemstones dangle from a silver chain.",28,88
1ptfnu0,,"They’re fused together. One is a full sphere, one is a half sphere. The final picture is identical to the third, but the necklace is gone.",26,89
1ptfnu0,,"I’m still wearing that necklace. I can feel the gemstones pushing into my chest. No matter how I pull, I can’t take it off. All I can do

There was a part of me, a part that I hate now, that felt compelled to respond.",26,68

It was like he was trying to coax a frightened animal into approaching him, pressing ever-so gently, seeing what he could get away with.",38,76

1pte1tg,,"I opened my mouth to scream, but before I could get a sound out, his hand shot out in front of me, covering my nose and mouth with a thick, white rag.",32,97
1pte1tg,,"A sharp, chemical smell filled my nose, stinging my sinuses. I tried to pull away, but his hands held it tightly to my face.",24,98
1pte1tg,,"“Let go of me!” I shouted, my voice muffled to nearly nothing by the rag. I kicked and thrashed, but his grip was like iron.",25,99
1pte1tg,,"His fingers dug into my ribs and arms, and his body pressed against me as he yanked me backwards, dragging me down the street and shoving me into the passenger seat.",31,100
1pte1tg,,"“You’re going to be fine,” he whispered in my ear, his breath hot against my neck.",16,101

1pte1tg,,"I don’t need any surprises.” He said, his words warbling in my ears as my body finally gave in to a deep, paralyzing sleep.",24,111

1ptaz8n,Tales From a Traveling Hobo (PT. 2),"I appreciate the engagement on my last post. I didn’t expect that many people to care, honestly.",17,0
1ptaz8n,,"It got me thinking that maybe I should keep writing these things down while I still can. If you haven’t read the last one, it might help.",27,1
1ptaz8n,,"Or it might not. These stories don’t always like being told in order. Here’s the last post: 

Now, as some of you already know, I’m homeless.",26,2
1ptaz8n,,"Some people pass me on the street without even glancing my way, like I’m just another crack in the sidewalk.",20,3
1ptaz8n,,Others make a point of not looking at me at all. I hear mothers tell their kids not to look me in the eyes.,24,4
1ptaz8n,,"Which, to be fair, is solid advice. Some folks out here aren’t fully on this temporal plain, and eye contact can get weird fast. Still, I’m human. I notice it.",30,5
1ptaz8n,,"It stings more than people think. Other folks get aggressive. They call me a bum, a vagrant, a tweaker, a thief.",21,6
1ptaz8n,,"Most of the time it’s some version of “get a job.” Like that idea never occurred to me. Believe me, I’ve tried. A lot of people out here try.",29,7
1ptaz8n,,That’s the part nobody wants to talk about. Most places don’t like hiring someone who can’t bathe regularly or keep clean clothes.,22,8
1ptaz8n,,"You need IDs, social security cards, sometimes an address. Reliable transportation helps too. All things I used to have without thinking twice.",22,9
1ptaz8n,,"When you first become homeless, you think you’ve got time. You tell yourself you just need a little while to get back on your feet. Then your phone gets stolen.",30,10
1ptaz8n,,Then your ID disappears. Then the blankets from your tent. Then your tent.,13,11
1ptaz8n,,Eventually all you’ve got left is whatever fits in your pockets and whatever you can guard while you sleep. Even fast food jobs are hard to land.,27,12
1ptaz8n,,Sometimes you get hired and work a few shifts. Then someone complains about the smell. Someone else swears they saw you using needles in the bathroom.,26,13
1ptaz8n,,"Customers recognize you as the guy from the corner. Management gets nervous. Next thing you know, you’re back outside again. That’s one of the reasons I keep moving. New towns.",30,14
1ptaz8n,,New faces. New chances. Sometimes that’s enough. This happened when I was traveling from New York to Florida.,18,15
1ptaz8n,,"I’d been hitchhiking and hopping trains for a couple days when I ended up in a small town in rural West Virginia. If you’ve never been there, it’s beautiful.",29,16
1ptaz8n,,"Green everywhere. Hills that feel older than they should. Also some of the strangest people you’ll ever meet, even without the paranormal stuff.",23,17
1ptaz8n,,What caught my attention right away was that there were no homeless people.Every town has at least one. Doesn’t matter how small.,22,18
1ptaz8n,,"So when you see none, it usually means one of two things. Either the town ran them all off, or there’s a serial killer.",24,19
1ptaz8n,,"Not wanting to get stabbed a third time, I decided to leave. I was walking toward the edge of town when a car pulled up next to me.",28,20
1ptaz8n,,A black Mercedes. Clean enough that it looked wrong out there. The window rolled down and a well dressed man smiled at me. No tie.,25,21
1ptaz8n,,"Hair slicked back just enough to look intentional. His skin was pale, like he hadn’t seen the sun in years.He asked if I wanted a job.",26,22
1ptaz8n,,I told him politely but firmly that I wasn’t in that line of work. He laughed and said it was just manual labor.,23,23
1ptaz8n,,Said he’d pay me well and give me a place to stay while the job was getting done.,18,24
1ptaz8n,,Normally I know better than to get into cars with strangers offering money. But hunger has a way of making bad ideas look reasonable. So I got in.,28,25
1ptaz8n,,We drove for a while. Winding roads. Dense forest. The kind of drive where you start rehearsing what you’ll do if he pulls a gun.,25,26
1ptaz8n,,Eventually we stopped in a clearing. There was a pit. A massive hole dug straight down into the earth.,19,27
1ptaz8n,,Men hauled wheelbarrows full of dirt and rock up scaffolding that looked like it had been built in a hurry.,20,28
1ptaz8n,,"The man handed me a pickaxe and a shovel like he was passing out pamphlets. “Go meet the manager at the bottom,” he said.",24,29
1ptaz8n,,The climb down the scaffolding took forever. Dirt turned to stone. The air got heavier the deeper I went. Men passed me hauling loads without saying much.,27,30
1ptaz8n,,"Everyone smelled like sweat, old clothes, and something metallic underneath. By the time I reached the bottom, my legs were shaking.",21,31
1ptaz8n,,"The man in charge was small and crooked, hunched like something had bent him wrong years ago and never bothered fixing it. His teeth were bad.",26,32
1ptaz8n,,"One eye didn’t quite line up with the other. “Find yerself a crew,” he said. “They won’t wait.”

That’s when I noticed it. Every man down there was homeless.",29,33
1ptaz8n,,Same layered clothes. Same careful grip on their tools. Same look in their eyes. My body told me to leave right then. Everything in me said this was wrong.,29,34
1ptaz8n,,But the pay they’d promised rattled around in my head. So I worked. Day after day. Swinging the pick. Rock fighting back. Blisters forming.,24,35
1ptaz8n,,Dust sticking to sweat until I felt like part of the pit myself. At night we sat around a fire and made soup. Men told boring stories that went nowhere.,30,36
1ptaz8n,,Complaints about old jobs. Jokes that weren’t funny anymore.Some of them didn’t want to leave. I didn’t blame them.,19,37
1ptaz8n,,"About a week in, my pickaxe hit something solid.The sound that came after didn’t belong in the ground. It wasn’t loud. It wasn’t violent.",24,38
1ptaz8n,,"It was deep and slow, like a breath being taken somewhere far below us. I felt it in my teeth before I understood what I was hearing.",27,39
1ptaz8n,,The ground shifted under my boots. That was enough.I dropped the pickaxe and ran. I didn’t shout. Didn’t warn anyone.,20,40
1ptaz8n,,"My body moved before my brain caught up, like something older than thought had decided for me. The stairs felt longer on the way up. Every step burned.",28,41
1ptaz8n,,My shoulders screamed from days of swinging that pick.,9,42
1ptaz8n,,"My hands shook so bad I missed the railing twice and almost went back down the hard way.Behind me, the sound came again. A groan. Not a roar.",28,43
1ptaz8n,,Not a scream. Just something massive rolling over in its sleep. The scaffolding trembled. Dust rained down. Men stopped working below. I heard confused voices. Someone laughed nervously.,28,44
1ptaz8n,,"Someone else told them to keep digging.I didn’t look back. By the time I reached the top, I stumbled out onto the dirt and dropped to my knees, gasping.",29,45
1ptaz8n,,"The air felt thin, like I’d come up too fast from underwater.For a second, nothing happened. The pit was still. Men moved around below like ants. No panic.",28,46
1ptaz8n,,"No screaming.I almost laughed.Then I heard shouting. I turned. Down in the pit, a group of men had gathered near a rock wall.",23,47
1ptaz8n,,"One of them knelt, pulling at iron links embedded in the stone.",12,48
1ptaz8n,,Chains scraped loose with a sound like teeth snapping.The manager pushed through the crowd.He stood straighter than I’d ever seen him.,21,49
1ptaz8n,,His hands shook as they dragged free a wooden case. Old. Dark. Swollen.,13,50
1ptaz8n,,"Wrapped in iron that felt more ceremonial than practical.When they opened it, I felt it.Pressure behind my eyes. Tightness in my chest.",22,51
1ptaz8n,,Like my body remembered something my mind didn’t want to. Inside was a book.Not ancient in a clean way. Ancient in a wrong way. The cover was warped.,28,52
1ptaz8n,,"The pages were thick and uneven, like they couldn’t agree on how long they’d been waiting.The manager laughed.Not relief. Not excitement.Joy. He lifted the book and began reading out loud.",30,53
1ptaz8n,,"The words didn’t echo. They sank. The stone around him seemed to lean in and listen. For a moment, nothing happened. Then the ground answered. Cracks spidered across the rock.",30,54
1ptaz8n,,The pit walls shuddered.,4,55
1ptaz8n,,"A sound like stone snapping filled the air, and water burst through the fractures as if the earth had been holding its breath for a thousand years and finally decided to spit it out.",34,56
1ptaz8n,,"At first it was only a stream. Then it became a rush. Then it became a rising, hungry thing.Men screamed and scrambled for the stairs. They slipped on wet rock.",30,57
1ptaz8n,,"They climbed over each other. They grabbed at beams and ropes and hands. And at the top of the pit, the man who hired me was waiting. Laughing.",28,58
1ptaz8n,,He kicked a man in the ribs and sent him back down. Then another.,14,59
1ptaz8n,,"Like he was making sure the pit got its share.For one horrible second, I considered running and not looking back. I’m not proud of that.",25,60
1ptaz8n,,"But fear does what it wants. Then I saw a kid. Not a child, but young enough to still have hope in his face.",24,61
1ptaz8n,,"He was clawing up the last few steps, eyes wide, reaching for the surface like it was a promise.The suited man raised his foot. I didn’t think.",27,62
1ptaz8n,,I ran and shoved him as hard as I could. He wasn’t as heavy as I expected.,17,63
1ptaz8n,,"He flailed when he went over, arms pinwheeling, still laughing like he couldn’t believe hr’d finally joined the fun.",19,64
1ptaz8n,,He fell into the pit he’d built and vanished into the rising water.I didn’t wait to see if he came back up. I ran. Not down the road.,28,65
1ptaz8n,,"Not toward town. Straight into the trees.Branches tore at my face and arms. Roots caught my feet. I tripped and went down hard, then got up again without stopping.",29,66
1ptaz8n,,"My lungs burned. My legs felt like they belonged to someone else. Behind me, the forest shook.Not like an earthquake.",20,67
1ptaz8n,,"More like something very large standing up after sitting too long.I ran until I couldn’t, and when I finally collapsed into a clearing, I saw it.",26,68
1ptaz8n,,A massive shadow lifting out of the tree line. It was indescribable. Wings that didn’t move like wings. Tendrils moving like they were swimming through the sky.,27,69
1ptaz8n,,A shape that hurt my mind to look at. A giant form of absorbed body parts and chin is of meat.,21,70
1ptaz8n,,It looked more blurry the longer I stared at it.,10,71
1ptaz8n,,"It rose over the forest and climbed into the sky, taking its place among the stars like it had always been there. Then it was gone. I didn’t scream.",29,72
1ptaz8n,,I didn’t pray. I didn’t do anything dramatic. I got up and walked back into town.,16,73
1ptaz8n,,"With the money I’d made in that pit, I bought a bus ticket to Florida so I could at least arrive somewhere with a little comfort and a little food in my stomach.",33,74
1ptaz8n,,"I fell asleep on the bus, rookie mistake.When I woke up, my money was gone.Everything I’d worked for was gone. Stolen, again.",22,75
1ptaz8n,,"But I was in Florida, I had made it to my destination.",12,76
1ptaz8n,,"The next time you want to call someone a bum, or yell at them to get a job, try to put yourself there.",23,77
1ptaz8n,,Imagine what it takes just to make it through a week. Try to be compassionate. I was in Florida for a while. Maybe I’ll tell a story from there next.,30,78
1ptaz8n,,"But this phone’s about to die, and I’ve learned not to make promises when the world’s full of things that don’t like being noticed.",24,79
1ptaz8n,,"If I don’t get captured by some ancient deity , I’ll post again. For now, this has been another tale from a traveling hobo.",24,80
1pt88hk,The traffic light turned red one hour ago. Should I just... go?,What holds you together? It's just a question. You don't have to get defensive. I'm asking - what keeps you in place? Prevents you from stepping out of line?,29,0
1pt88hk,,"Is it your sense of morality, or your fear? I'm asking this because maybe I'll get an answer to my problem, too.",22,1
1pt88hk,,"I believe (if you ask me, but of course *no one* asked, I'm just sitting in a car in the middle of the night and talking to myself, I don't even know if this post will reach a lot of people, but it's worth a try)...",46,2
1pt88hk,,"as I said, I believe that we are all children in a way.",13,3
1pt88hk,,"We obey some rules that we grew up with, out of annoyance, but we're too lazy to question them. When no one is watching, some of us rebel.",28,4
1pt88hk,,"Some of us are too lazy or too numb to do that, either. So we wait it out. The impulse, I mean. And, in my case, the red light.",29,5
1pt88hk,,"I hear the wind breathe softly outside my car. It could be the wind, or Tay's breathing from the back seat.",21,6
1pt88hk,,"We'd just gone to our annual Christmas gathering - we have these, uh, high school friends who host every year and I was the designated driver now.",27,7
1pt88hk,,"I dropped off Mary, and now the passenger seat is empty. Tay lives the furthest away, so I took a detour to get to her home.",26,8
1pt88hk,,"I should've been on the way back by now, had it not been for this stupid light. I'm vaguely familiar with the roads outside my town.",26,9
1pt88hk,,"I don't drive very often. Especially at night. It's not that I'm scared, I'm just lazy and I like to be the one who drinks.",25,10
1pt88hk,,"I'm vaguely familiar with these woods - passed through them a million times, never paid enough attention.",17,11
1pt88hk,,Most of these times they were just a blurry haze as my head spun from the backseat to the window to some friend's ear - usually Josh's.,27,12
1pt88hk,,"That stung a bit, the memory. Josh didn't come tonight. I don't know why. I was looking forward to seeing him.",21,13
1pt88hk,,"For the past hour, I've been studying my surroundings painfully sober. The woods are to my right, separated by a fence... some military base? Was this the area?",28,14
1pt88hk,,"I'm not very good at positioning myself in space, I had a vague idea of some base around my hometown, but I swear all woods look the same to me...",30,15
1pt88hk,,"The fog is everywhere, I can also see some windowless industrial buildings stretching to my left, and then there's the two roads that intersect. Mine, engulfed by the dark horizon.",30,16
1pt88hk,,"The other one, perpendicular, cutting across the woods and the buildings. When I first arrived, I almost ran the red, but stopped just in time.",25,17
1pt88hk,,"A truck practically flew past me and I cursed him out for driving so fast at - let me check - 2am then, since it is now 3.",28,18
1pt88hk,,"""Phew, where the fuck are you going, buddy?"" said Tay from the back. ""A vehicle so big shouldn't go 100mph. Could've fucking killed me."" I muttered.",26,19
1pt88hk,,"So I waited in the middle of fucking nowhere. The only car on the road. Five minutes passed, then ten. ""I don't understand why it's so long.",27,20
1pt88hk,,"It's the middle of the night. No traffic.""

""Just go,"" said Tay from the back.",15,21
1pt88hk,,"She was laying down on the backseat to ""rest her eyes"" and throwing in random slurred remarks. ""Just... go.",19,22
1pt88hk,,"Nobody's gon' pass, not right now...""

Right then, a motorcycle proved us wrong. Then another. Then another. I sighed.",19,23
1pt88hk,,"Tapping my fingers on the steering wheel, I let another 10 minutes pass. ""This is fucking ridiculous. Twenty minutes went by.""

Tay didn't respond. She'd fallen asleep. ""Come onnn...",29,24
1pt88hk,,"fuck off fuck off fuck off fuck off-"" I whispered, resting my head on the steering wheel. The light didn't respond and remained a piercing, unblinking crimson.",27,25
1pt88hk,,"Every time I'd shift into 1st gear, a sense of wrongness would take over. I kept gripping the gear shift and looking around. No one else was there.",28,26
1pt88hk,,"Not one fucking soul. *Just run it.*

I couldn't. I really wished Tay hadn't fallen asleep. I feel so alone, and my surroundings aren't very helpful.",26,27
1pt88hk,,"In the red glow, the asphalt looks like it's simmering. A pair of shoes tied by their laces from the telephone wires above sends a shiver down my spine.",29,28
1pt88hk,,"I don't know if it's true, but I heard those mark spots where people sell drugs. Or worse. The industrial buildings look abandoned. I keep shifting in my seat.",29,29
1pt88hk,,The red glow seems to be staining the inside of the car. My own skin looks like it's bruising or rotting. The car looks drenched in blood.,27,30
1pt88hk,,"I wish Tay would just fucking move. I don't want to wake her up. The world outside looks normal, boring, desolate.",21,31
1pt88hk,,"I've spent the past minutes praying for something to happen, and then it did. I can see a silhouette in my rearview mirror. Oh my God, please don't get closer.",30,32
1pt88hk,,"I stare at it, my hands gripping the wheel, knuckles white and fingers drenched in sweat. It just stands and watches, thank God.",23,33
1pt88hk,,"I couldn't bear to have it move towards me. That's it, if ten more minutes pass and the light isn't turning, I'll fucking go. Go... where?",26,34
1pt88hk,,"I stare at the road unfolding before me. The dark asphalt seems to curve like a tongue, leading me deeper into the throat of whatever's waiting for me to move.",30,35
1pt88hk,,"I'll turn the car around. *But do you want to turn your back to this thing?*

Fuck it, I'll take a right. How bad can it be?",27,36
1pt88hk,,"A bang on my window startles me. I turn my head and stare at a middle aged man, motioning at me to roll down my window.",26,37
1pt88hk,,He was the silhouette I'd seen in my rearview mirror. Nothing supernatural. No giants about to swallow me.,18,38
1pt88hk,,"Just my car in the middle of Fucksville, a wrongly programmed light and a random dude. I still don't like my options.",22,39
1pt88hk,,"I'm still a woman in the middle of Fucksville, at 3am, looking at a random dude. I nod my head at him. He frowns a little.",26,40
1pt88hk,,"I barely crack the window, just to hear him. ""Hey. You okay?""

""Yeah."" I respond stoically. He's wearing a jacket and a baseball hat. Unshaved.",25,41
1pt88hk,,"A tamed look in his eyes. ""You haven't moved in a while. I work at that security post there -"" he motions towards the buildings.",25,42
1pt88hk,,"""The light is red."" I respond childishly. I see a glimmer of a smile in his eyes. Amusement, I suppose. ""It's 3am. Nobody's here.""

""A truck passed by really fast.",30,43
1pt88hk,,"And then some motorcycles.""

His eyes keep darting to the interior of my car and my backseat. Fear has grown another heart in my chest, one that pounds chaotically.",29,44
1pt88hk,,"""This light is fucked. Whoever programmed it didn't do their job. I'm sure you're sick of waiting. Just go. I won't tell on you.",24,45
1pt88hk,,"It goes like that every night."" He smiles. I know he's right. It's perfectly rational, what he's saying. I'll just go. I grab the gear shift.",26,46
1pt88hk,,"Suddenly, a whisper comes from *within* me. A pleading, desperate *don't*. Since when did I become so... obedient?",18,47
1pt88hk,,"It's the same impulse that just won't let you jump off a building. I smile faintly. ""It's fine, I'll just wait.""

""The whole night?""

""Yeah.""

I feel embarrassed.",28,48
1pt88hk,,"I'm not afraid of this random guy anymore. He's just some night shift worker who tried to tell me to just go, like any sane person would. He just shrugs.",30,49
1pt88hk,,"Blood rushes into my cheeks. I'm so ridiculous. Then, he tries my car door. It all happens so fast, I can barely register it. His hand, pulling onto the handle.",30,50
1pt88hk,,"A small rattle. His eyes devoid of any smile. His surprise, and glint of embarrassment. His walk away, to the shadows. To the woods. My throat tightens.",27,51
1pt88hk,,"I feel deceived, I feel awful, I feel ashamed, and the fear and shock won't let me breathe. I just sit there frozen in time. The light doesn't matter anymore.",30,52
1pt88hk,,"This guy just tried my car door. He might return: I just told him I won't be going anywhere until dawn. That's it, I'm turning the car around.",28,53
1pt88hk,,"I reverse a little, then I make a large U-turn. I'm facing the other way now. Suddenly, the crimson interior of my car changes to a sickly green.",28,54
1pt88hk,,"*You've got to be kidding me.*

I look in my rearview mirror. Yeah, the light just turned green. I struggle a little, but I manage to make yet *another* U-turn.",30,55
1pt88hk,,"I'm about to floor it, fueled by anger and fear, when a car flies past me in a dizzying speed. ""WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING?",26,56
1pt88hk,,"YOUR LIGHT IS RED, YOU DUMB BITCH!"" I explode, honking. I respect traffic rules, why didn't they? They could've fucking killed me. I would have died because of their mistake.",30,57
1pt88hk,,"Oddly, Tay wasn't awoken by my screams and honking. I turn to look at her. She'd slept like a log this whole time. ""Tay.""

No answer. Something is wrong.",29,58
1pt88hk,,"She's a very light sleeper. I reach behind me and pull on her leg. ""*Tay!*""

I unbuckle my seatbelt and crawl into the backseat. She's not even sleeping.",28,59
1pt88hk,,"Her eyes are wide, fixated on me. Actually, behind me. She motions at me to shut up. Her whispers are barely perceptible. ""You woke me up with your honking.",29,60
1pt88hk,,"There's someone in the woods. I think you fucking drew their attention. Don't turn around.""

""The car is locked.",19,61
1pt88hk,,"There's nothing they can do.""

""I don't think that's true.""

""What to we do?""

""Are you insane? *Drive.""*

*""I can't!*"" I cry out.",23,62
1pt88hk,,"""The light is red again!""

She shoots me an exasperated look, as if she's saying ""Are you nuts?",18,63
1pt88hk,,"You wanna obey traffic rules now?"", and then nods towards the front seat. I shake my head. ""I'm gonna turn the car around.",23,64
1pt88hk,,"I know you might not understand, but I'm terribly afraid to run the red light.""

""Do whatever you want, just go.""

I crawl into the driver's seat and, as I prepare to make the turn, I notice something in my rearview mirror.",42,65
1pt88hk,,"A glimmer on the asphalt. ""What the fuck?""

""What? What is it?""

Tay turns to look. Someone laid down spike strips behind us.",23,66

1pt3w1k,,"Between tea sips and stuffing her face with short bread, she criticised him in front of the eavesdropping congregation.",19,4
1pt3w1k,,She started quoting some Platinga guy and listed off a bunch of science stuff I didn't understand at that age.,20,5
1pt3w1k,,It wasn't long before his mouth was stuffed with biscuits too. Any excuse to avoid speaking to my mother.,19,6
1pt3w1k,,"Since she didn’t want us worshipping ‘false idols, so Santa was a no go in our house. Last I checked, I was never praying to Santa.",26,7
1pt3w1k,,Though I suppose I can’t fault her for sticking to her principles. Dad was always bummed out about it.,19,8
1pt3w1k,,"Every year my grandparents would ask me what I asked Santa for, then he’d remind them with a solemn look Santa wouldn't be visiting.",24,9
1pt3w1k,,"However, avoiding talking to my mother was a sentiment he shared with the pastor. So, no Santa it was. But little me knew he was real.",26,10
1pt3w1k,,"Each year he’d leave me gifts at the foot of my door. I often wondered if Santa was blind, or if his elves were overworked, due to the crude wrapping.",30,11
1pt3w1k,,"Some years they weren’t even in bags or paper, they’d just be tied with a cheap bow. Nothing else. They always had a funny smell as well.",27,12
1pt3w1k,,"Not bad, just funny. It reminded me of when my dad didn’t shower for a week one summer due to a water shortage.",23,13
1pt3w1k,,"Like in that state of almost putrid, but not quite yet. The first present I got was when I was 4.",21,14
1pt3w1k,,I had begged my parents all year for a Claudine Monster High doll.,13,15
1pt3w1k,,"In am attempt to avoid a crying toddler on Christmas day, they made it crystal clear that they just couldn’t afford one.",22,16
1pt3w1k,,"We got our dog Misty the year before, and that damn Terrier could eat for five families.",17,17
1pt3w1k,,That appetite of hers was eating into our funds as much as her dog bowl. My parents did promise they’d try to find the next best thing though.,28,18
1pt3w1k,,I loved Misty too much to hold it against her. All her antics were far more entertaining than a doll. The bizarre little rescue used to work for the police.,30,19
1pt3w1k,,"Not the typical breed they'd use, but she had a great sniffer.",12,20
1pt3w1k,,"In typical Misty fashion however her stomach led her more than her nose, and she ate more evidence than she provided. So, her handler sadly had to give her up.",30,21
1pt3w1k,,"Ever the greedy mutt, she somehow figured out how to open doors.",12,22
1pt3w1k,,"Anytime I found her inside the cupboards she’d just be sniffing around, but all the missing food around the house was evidence of her crimes.",25,23
1pt3w1k,,"Before she was a year old, we started discovering large parts of our groceries had vanished without a trace.",19,24
1pt3w1k,,"Once we realised who the culprit was, we started panicking since the plastic wrapping was gone too.",17,25
1pt3w1k,,"The vet found no plastic contents in her stomach, so Misty must've buried the packaging elsewhere. We started locking the cabinets.",21,26
1pt3w1k,,"I didn’t kick up a fuss about my Christmas dreams being spoiled, but it was a let down.",18,27
1pt3w1k,,All the kids in my neighbourhood would delight in telling me the lists they’d give Santa. I’d always make sure to remind them Santa wasn’t real.,26,28
1pt3w1k,,"To my annoyance, they had the power of the majority to decide I was wrong. Every year they got whatever was on their Santa lists.",25,29
1pt3w1k,,I remember thinking it’d be great if this Santa guy could replace my parents -  just for Christmas of course. Then I'd get all the toys I wanted.,28,30
1pt3w1k,,"To my surprise, on Christmas morning a cardboard box laid at my feet. If I had been moving faster I would’ve kicked it down the hallway.",26,31
1pt3w1k,,"Fortunately, I spotted it due to it’s bold red writing that read;

‘From Santa.’

I was confused. Santa wasn’t real! Was dad playing a practical joke on me?",28,32
1pt3w1k,,"I had woken up before my parents, so I took the opportunity to uncover the mystery alone in my room. I shook the box to guess what was inside.",29,33
1pt3w1k,,"Just a little though, I feared it’d be fragile. I didn’t know why, but I was nervous. I really wanted to know if this Santa guy was worth the hype.",30,34
1pt3w1k,,Or if maybe this was some strange test from mother to see if I’d been listening to her.,18,35
1pt3w1k,,"The big red guy certainly didn’t seem to deserve the praise from the sight of the box. Other than the writing, there was just a pathetic bow tied with string.",30,36
1pt3w1k,,"I didn’t need scissors to open it up either. It was so poorly taped the sides weren’t even stuck together, instead the sticky plastic shot up to the ceiling.",29,37
1pt3w1k,,"The box itself was torn up, as if someone had opened it just to seal it again.",17,38
1pt3w1k,,"I was still careful ripping it open, my parents room was right next door and I didn’t want them to hear.",21,39
1pt3w1k,,What I found inside was nothing short of a miracle. It was the exact doll I had begged my parents for. She was a bit rough around the edges.,29,40
1pt3w1k,,"Her hair was in knots, one in particular was molded together with some sticky substance I couldn’t identify.",18,41
1pt3w1k,,"Her clothes were clearly from another doll, they barely fit and didn’t match her colour palette. The paint adorning her lip was scratched off and her joints were stiff.",29,42
1pt3w1k,,"But it was her! I was ecstatic. I could fix all her quirks, no bother. A repaint, some conditioner, then boom. Perfect. Though my joy was followed promptly by confusion.",30,43
1pt3w1k,,Mum had always said Santa wasn’t real. Maybe it was from my parents? Why wasn’t it downstairs with the rest of my presents then?,24,44
1pt3w1k,,It couldn’t have been Misty that’s for sure. I decided to keep the discovery a secret until I figured out for myself what was going on.,26,45
1pt3w1k,,"Afterall, if this Santa guy was real I just hit a goldmine! I didn’t want mum chasing him off.",19,46
1pt3w1k,,When my parents woke up they made no mention of any night time visitors.,14,47
1pt3w1k,,We just went to the living room as per routine and one by one unwrapped our presents. My parents didn’t get me a Monster High doll.,26,48
1pt3w1k,,They did get me a Barbie however with accessories and a doggy companion that looked just like little Misty.,19,49
1pt3w1k,,I got so distracted playing with the new doll I forgot about the surprise one upstairs.,16,50
1pt3w1k,,If a toy was new and shiny enough that’s what I’d usually tend to do. I was a bit of an airhead as a kid.,25,51
1pt3w1k,,"When I went back up to my room, I saw my peculiar gift poking out from under my bed, an immediate reminder. Oh, right. So, it wasn’t my parents!",29,52
1pt3w1k,,"This Santa guy must be real after all. He’s way better than this Jesus guy anyway, he actually gives me stuff!",21,53
1pt3w1k,,"I didn’t want to eat my words when I saw the other kids, but it was undeniable now.",18,54
1pt3w1k,,"I couldn’t help but wonder if he was as jolly as they said. Was his beard really as white as snow? Wait, or was that Rudolph?",26,55
1pt3w1k,,"No, his gimmick was the nose. Dammit, getting distracted again. Whatever the answer, I couldn’t ask my parents.",18,56
1pt3w1k,,"The no Santa tradition continued in full force, if I mentioned I knew the truth I’d have to listen to mum repeat otherwise. She may even take Claudine away!",29,57
1pt3w1k,,"This was undeniable proof though. She always did harp on about evidence and stuff. On the other hand, she’s also stubborn.",21,58
1pt3w1k,,"No, I was not risking my Caludine’s life on a risky bet. Under my bed out of my parents sigh she shall remain. I continued to receive packages from Santa.",30,59
1pt3w1k,,With every year the gifts got a bit stranger. They also got further and further away from what I had asked for. One year I asked for a lego set.,30,60
1pt3w1k,,"Instead, I got jenga blocks that had been carved into a crude imitation. Another year I asked for a lava lamp.",21,61
1pt3w1k,,"This time, I got a regular lamp with no light bulb. This pattern of odd gifts continued. I asked for new shoes, I got slippers.",25,62
1pt3w1k,,"I asked for a zoo play set, I got an old mouse catnip toy. Hot wheels cars? Nope, an old wooden train set.",23,63
1pt3w1k,,"I wanted Jesus back, this Santa guy was incompetent. Not only were all these toys not what I asked for, but they were useless!",24,64
1pt3w1k,,"By this age, all my classmates were starting to deny Santa’s existence. I must’ve had my mothers strong spirit as I kept believing long past the other kids.",28,65
1pt3w1k,,"But by the time I was getting a stick of gum instead of sweets, which were in a shoe instead of a stocking, I began to have doubts.",28,66
1pt3w1k,,"Maybe they all just stopped believing because Santa was just the worst. Even if the gifts appeared every year, there’s no way I’d keep believing in this guy.",28,67
1pt3w1k,,It was then I considered something. What if it was someone else? It hit me: dad! He was always so disappointed with the lack of Santa in my life.,29,68
1pt3w1k,,"Maybe he’d been leaving these gifts all along. If he had a small budget and needed to hide them from mum, he’d have to get second hand nonsense.",28,69
1pt3w1k,,"It made perfect sense! On Boxing day, I ran down the stairs to find my dad in the kitchen.",19,70
1pt3w1k,,"Humming a tune, he scrubbed down the sink with bleach and soda crystals. A nose pinching smell had been developing in the pipes.",23,71
1pt3w1k,,Certain areas of the house had become clouds of death at night from just how strong it had become.,19,72
1pt3w1k,,"We figured it was an old house, they tend to come with equally ancient smells.",15,73
1pt3w1k,,"We had a plumber out a few times, he flushed them out which helped for a while. But a few months would pass and it'd come back even stronger.",29,74
1pt3w1k,,"Dad to combat it began weekly scrub-athons. He'd go sink to sink, toilet to toilet cleaning them till his hands ached. It seemed to work.",25,75
1pt3w1k,,"Much better than hearing Misty whines anyway, that nose of hers made her more alert to it than us. The older Misty grew the more anything seemed to bother her.",30,76
1pt3w1k,,"At night she'd whine a lot even after the smell had gone. The sensory horrors of our house aside, I focused on how to test my father.",27,77
1pt3w1k,,Mum was in the room next door so I had to be careful with  my words.,16,78
1pt3w1k,,"Before I could utter a sentence, dad was scrambling in a panic to stop Misty from eating the fridge’s contents.",20,79
1pt3w1k,,"I found myself rooting for her over my own flesh and blood, but alas she was a tiny girl and dad could pick her up with one hand.",28,80
1pt3w1k,,My girl was never winning this battle. “Oh Misty… why are you like this?” My dad grumbled to himself. It was then he spotted me.,25,81
1pt3w1k,,"“Emily, I didn’t see you there pet. Did you need something?”

I got so distracted by all the commotion I had forgotten my original objective again.",26,82
1pt3w1k,,"“Dad, can you get me a light bulb?”

“A light bulb?” 

“Yeah, I need one.” I winked at him, but he just stared back with a blank expression.",28,83
1pt3w1k,,"After a moment, he laughed. “Sure kid, I’ll get you a candle too!”

I never received a bulb nor a candle.",21,84
1pt3w1k,,"Looking back at it, this was a clear attempt at one of his poor jokes. But to a 9 year old me, this was all the proof I needed.",29,85
1pt3w1k,,"He never asked why I asked for one, so he must’ve known it was for the lamp. Simple.",18,86
1pt3w1k,,"I wish he could’ve got it without me prompting him to, but this works. Back to my toys I went, and soon I forgot about the light bulb.",28,87
1pt3w1k,,There was another reason to worry. I was running out of room under my bed. I needed somewhere to store my toys before they were found. Maybe the attic?,29,88
1pt3w1k,,"But I'm too short to reach the door. It wasn't even really a door, just a block of wood we slid to the side.",24,89
1pt3w1k,,"There was no lock so that'd make it easier, but no way I could lift it and sneak a ladder over.",21,90
1pt3w1k,,"We kept our Christmas decorations up there and not much else, so it would be a good hiding spot. No, I decided against it.",24,91
1pt3w1k,,The smell up there was rotten anyway since dad never went up there. Misty hated the attic too. When we first got her she'd bark at it a lot.,29,92
1pt3w1k,,"The barking ceased, unless it was open. Making it a definite no go zone for hiding. I didn't need all my gifts however.",23,93
1pt3w1k,,"If the next gift was too big, I'd chuck a couple out. Then the next year came. I asked for a porcelain doll. No, I wasn't born in the 60s.",30,94
1pt3w1k,,But it was a new trend at school. By trend I mean Amy-Lee got one and now everyone wanted one. My parents were blunt.,24,95
1pt3w1k,,They didn't trust me with something that fragile. And expensive. I insisted they could get a cheap one but they refused. Bahumbug.,22,96
1pt3w1k,,They had me choose something else from my list. I had faith in my father to pull through however. Or should I say ‘Santa’.,24,97
1pt3w1k,,There'd be plenty of old broken dolls at charity shops or sold second hand online. I was sure he would manage. I didn't get anything close to porcelain.,28,98
1pt3w1k,,"The cardboard box was way too big for the size of its contents. It wasn't even taped together this time, instead falling apart at the sides.",26,99
1pt3w1k,,It smelt even worse than all the other ones too. Inside was a rag doll. An old rag doll with matted blonde hair. Hair that looked a lot like mine.,30,100
1pt3w1k,,"It had no clothes and was poorly stitched together, its stuffing still seeping out of the cracks. It was not cute or cuddly. It was just a mess.",28,101
1pt3w1k,,I tried my best to ignore the stains splotted over it.,11,102
1pt3w1k,,"Its face was scratched off and painted over, it looked as if it was done in anger with how frantic the paint strokes appeared.",24,103
1pt3w1k,,The weirdest detail stapled to its forehead. In place of its face was a polaroid photo. A polaroid photo of me. I did not remember the photo being taken.,29,104
1pt3w1k,,I didn't seem to be aware of a camera in the picture either. I was tucked away in a bright white rectangle in the corner of a pitch black image.,30,105
1pt3w1k,,I was looking up at something as I saw hands emerge from the same location I stood. My mum's hands. Reaching for Christmas decorations. The attic?,26,106
1pt3w1k,,"I threw the photo away and gave the doll to Misty. When my parents asked where she got it, I said she must've dug it up.",26,107
1pt3w1k,,There's no way my dad would give me something so strange. I too realised he never got a lightbulb.,19,108
1pt3w1k,,"I considered this being a cruel lesson from my mother, an elaborate ruse to show why I shouldn't believe fairytales so easily. But she didn't take the photo.",28,109
1pt3w1k,,"I doubt dad did either. The polaroid was recent too, I could tell it was from the start of the month when we began decorating.",25,110
1pt3w1k,,"So I wouldn't have forgotten it being taken. My parents seemed a bit out of it Christmas morning, like they did not sleep.",23,111
1pt3w1k,,There was a possibility they really had been sneaking around and this was a poor DIY gift.,17,112
1pt3w1k,,What confirmed it wasn't either parent was when I unwrapped their present to find a porcelain doll. I should've said something. But fear crippled me.,25,113
1pt3w1k,,I wanted to believe the lie that it was really Santa. Or some mythical creature that doesn't understand what a good gift is.,23,114
1pt3w1k,,"It wasn't a violating image, yet I felt gross. From then on, I felt like someone was watching me. These constant omnipresent eyes I couldn't escape from.",27,115
1pt3w1k,,"That's when I remembered, Misty was beside me in bed that night. Misty would bark at visitors, postmen, and even her own shadow.",23,116
1pt3w1k,,"While her whining had stopped in the past year, her constant yapping never ceased.",14,117
1pt3w1k,,The only people that didn't get to hear her vocal nature was when it just was us. That sniffer was too accustomed to us.,24,118
1pt3w1k,,"If someone had truly been outside my door, she would've barked up a storm. I never sent any letters to anyone either. How could someone know what I wanted?",29,119
1pt3w1k,,"No one was there for our conversations, so this figure could somehow read minds. That brought me some relief. It wasn't a person, not likely to be a monster either.",30,120
1pt3w1k,,"Monsters wouldn’t leave gifts. Could it have really been Santa? It felt a strange conclusion, but one a scared 10 year old was willing to accept.",26,121
1pt3w1k,,What if he was real after all? A guy like that would probably have magic to take a photo without me knowing.,22,122
1pt3w1k,,I'm sure he'd be an expert dog tamer too. I think deep down I knew I was lying to myself.,20,123
1pt3w1k,,"But I didn't want to ask my parents anything about it. Not just because they'd take all my other stuff away, but because I feared their answer. At least subconsciously.",30,124
1pt3w1k,,I decided what I should do. What mother always talked about. Evidence. I set out to catch the mystery gifter in the act.,23,125
1pt3w1k,,"Whether it be a magical old man or one of my parents I was going to find out for myself. Then, I'd report whatever answer I got onto mum.",29,126
1pt3w1k,,She'd know what to do from there. Misty was getting older before she was getting younger. The less energy she had the more I felt bad for her.,28,127
1pt3w1k,,"I wanted to get her a friend but I think we all knew a younger dog would drive her mad. So, I asked for a stuffed dog plushie.",28,128
1pt3w1k,,The best plan an 11 year old can muster. Though I knew ‘Santa’ would be able to get me one.,20,129
1pt3w1k,,"Stuffed dogs were a popular form of teddy, Santa could find one anywhere. My parents already agreed, but an extra didn't hurt. Especially if I guaranteed Santa showed up.",29,130
1pt3w1k,,I had to hype myself up to be a big girl. Keeping my door open all night in the dark sent my imagination racing.,24,131
1pt3w1k,,I'd always imagine some monster creeping up the stairs to take me in my sleep. My circumstances made that image more vivid than usual.,24,132
1pt3w1k,,"It had to be done, I knew that. If I just roughed it out I'd manage. I didn't need to sleep anyway, quite the opposite.",25,133
1pt3w1k,,I needed to remain awake all night long and my buzzing mind could help with that. I waited. I waited and waited.,22,134
1pt3w1k,,My eyes bounced around each dark corner of the hallway. I didn't know where he was going to come from. I just had to wait. Be patient.,27,135
1pt3w1k,,I wished I brought Misty to bed with me. I couldn't risk her scaring him off though. This was my one shot.,22,136
1pt3w1k,,"If I saw him, he may never come back again. Or maybe he would. Who knows, I didn't get the rules. It was a risk not worth taking either way.",30,137
1pt3w1k,,"A couple times I was tempted to shout into my parents to get me a glass of water. I wasn't thirsty, just terrified.",23,138
1pt3w1k,,I thought sending them downstairs would mean they could scout it out on my behalf.,15,139
1pt3w1k,,"But when they go down those stairs they could bump into Santa and make him run away. I had to commit, I had to know.",25,140
1pt3w1k,,The visibility was poor but I could make out that 3 hours had ticked away on the clock. My eyes were so heavy.,23,141
1pt3w1k,,Not even fear could remove the thick blanket of exhaustion that was washing over me. Just a few more hours Emily.,21,142
1pt3w1k,,Just a few more hours and you will catch him. I don't think I understood what a few meant. What I did know was I had to stay awake.,29,143
1pt3w1k,,"But I couldn't. I didn't realise it had happened. I just drifted off peacefully. I think I dreamt about Misty, her little tail wagging as I returned home from school.",30,144
1pt3w1k,,I didn't want it to end. That was until I heard a creak. It was a struggle peeling open my eyes.,21,145
1pt3w1k,,My eye-lids fought hard to shut again but my mind vaguely recalled the mission I had set forth. I peaked from under my covers towards the doorway.,27,146
1pt3w1k,,"It was so dark, even focusing my eyes didn't help to reveal the source of the sound. Then I saw him. Or well, the silhouette of him.",27,147
1pt3w1k,,I could see a flimsy hat on his head with a plump pom pom at the end.,17,148
1pt3w1k,,"He wore big boots, seeming to be made out of leather with how they squeaked.",15,149
1pt3w1k,,"I think I could also make out the outline of a beard but no other details on his face. It was him, it was really Santa.",26,150
1pt3w1k,,"I laid my head back down, too tired to entirely comprehend who stood at my door. I couldn't help but smile to myself however, knowing something magical had happened.",29,151
1pt3w1k,,"Quiet, I murmured, “Thank you, Santa.”

I could see him put a finger to his mouth shushing me, before turning away.",21,152
1pt3w1k,,My eyes began to crust back together again as I watched him tip toe away. The last thought I remember having was guilt.,23,153
1pt3w1k,,"We really should've left milk and cookies for him. When I awoke again, it was Christmas morning.",17,154
1pt3w1k,,"It took me a minute to fully escape my slumber, but it hit me hard when I remembered what had happened. I practically jumped out of bed.",27,155
1pt3w1k,,I was so excited I couldn't wait to tell everyone. Santa was real! He was real!,16,156
1pt3w1k,,"I had no proof other than the gifts for now, but I'd get more next year. But I knew he was real!",22,157
1pt3w1k,,"Without a second thought I brought the cardboard box inside and slammed it onto my bed. Again, poorly taped and no paper but I didn't care.",26,158
1pt3w1k,,"This one was a big one, at least weight wise. Santa must've got Misty a big friend! I couldn't wait to surprise her.",23,159
1pt3w1k,,It may not be a real dog but she could have a pretend pack like the wolves on TV! I tore it open without considering how to.,27,160
1pt3w1k,,"I just knew it all needed to go so I could look inside. Paper landed all over the floor, but I could pick it up later.",26,161
1pt3w1k,,"Right now I just– 

I was confused. I didn't understand. Inside there was a dog plush, just like I asked for. Yet, there was something off about it.",28,162
1pt3w1k,,"For a toy it was hyper realistic, uncannily so. Like if I touched it I'd feel its stomach move. The red stuffing was the main give away it wasn't real.",30,163
1pt3w1k,,"But the oddest thing of all was…

It looked just like Misty. I reached a hand in, stroking its fur. It felt like Misty.",24,164
1pt3w1k,,"A bit of a wet dog smell too. It smelt like Misty. There was even a little warmth of it, but like it was fading out. That wasn't like Misty.",30,165
1pt3w1k,,"When I removed my hand, I realised the stuffing wasn't naturally that colour. I ran out into the hallway and began whistling. “Misty!” I yelled out. Nothing.",27,166
1pt3w1k,,"Not even the sound of movement. “Misty! Here girl!” My desperate plea echoed. Still nothing. “MISTY!” This time it was a screech, reality hitting me like a truck.",28,167
1pt3w1k,,"My mum burst out of my parents room, disoriented by being woken so suddenly. I ignored her as I rushed back to my room.",24,168
1pt3w1k,,"“Emily, what's the matter?” She inquired somewhat expasterated. Shaking, I approached her, my increasingly colder Christmas gift laid across my arms. The coming tears overwhelmed me.",26,169
1pt3w1k,,"I could only quiver out a meek response. “Misty…”

I didn't know how, but my mother immediately grasped the situation.",20,170
1pt3w1k,,"“Eric, we need to go, now!” 

It all happened so fast I didn't know how to process it.",18,171
1pt3w1k,,All I knew was we abandoned our home and all our presents to run to our neighbours house. My mum demanded a phone to call the police.,27,172
1pt3w1k,,"The neighbours didn't argue, because despite all the chaos I never set Misty down. My tears soaked her empty husk. My girl, it was all my fault.",27,173
1pt3w1k,,It wasn't until after my parents spoke to the police I pieced everything together. My parents had already had their suspicions before Misty's fate.,24,174
1pt3w1k,,"They had grown uneasy about the persistent smell, but that wasn't all. At night mum could swear she heard faint murmurs in the attic.",24,175

1pt3w1k,,So much trash. Whoever lived there must've rummaged about a lot. There were piles of old useless items that had long been tossed.,23,180
1pt3w1k,,They had a dedicated corner with flattened cardboard boxes and tape. The smell in the pipes wasn't the pipes themselves.,20,181
1pt3w1k,,"The crawl space was mainly for insulation, so much of the rotten junk seeped down into the walls.",18,182
1pt3w1k,,The gap between these walls was even big enough for someone to slide inside. Beside a blanket and a pillow was a beaten up plastic folder. It contained photos.,29,183
1pt3w1k,,"Hundreds of photos. They must’ve chosen to pay for the polaroid paper over food, stealing our own to get by. All for one purpose. Me.",25,184
1pt3w1k,,They were all photos of me. From the attic. From cracks in the walls. From the kitchen when we were all outside. Some outside my bedroom door.,27,185
1pt3w1k,,"They dated back to when I was a toddler. Playing with mum in the garden, us all eating dinner, so many of me sleeping at night.",26,186

1pt3o38,My Best Friend Went First Across King's Ridge. He Never Came Back the Same.,"The mountain was never supposed to lock Mark inside. The weather was worse than we thought. It wasn’t supposed to snow that day, but a blizzard hit us.",28,0
1pt3o38,,"We were halfway up the mountain, and the cabin was not far enough from the ridge. “Mark, I don't think we can get over King’s Ridge.",26,1
1pt3o38,,"The blizzard is too strong.” 

“We can’t just wait and sit around in this weather. It’s alright, John, I’ll go first.",21,2
1pt3o38,,"Hold onto the straps.”

“Mark, I really don’t think so…”

“Just hold on!”

He screamed in my face.",18,3
1pt3o38,,I tried to yell at him to stop; we could barely see a few feet in front of us. But Mark wouldn’t listen anymore; his mind was made up.,29,4
1pt3o38,,I rested my body against the mountain and grabbed the harness of my rope. My heart was beating hard in my chest.,22,5
1pt3o38,,"Mark started walking on the ridge, holding onto the rocks, his bag bumping behind his body. Less than a minute passed, and I couldn’t see him anymore. Then a scream.",30,6
1pt3o38,,"The rope started pulling so hard that I was scared the hook would come out of the rock. Somehow, I managed to stay on my feet.",26,7
1pt3o38,,"“Are you okay, Mark?!” I screamed down to him. “Yeah, I’m good,” he said in a calm voice. “Can you climb up?”

Soon, he emerged from beneath the ridge, laughing.",30,8
1pt3o38,,"“It’s getting bad. Let's turn around.”

“We’re so close.",9,9
1pt3o38,,"Let’s just wait for like 20 minutes, maybe it will pass.”

“What if it gets worse, then we won’t even be able to get back!”

“Twenty minutes.” Mark didn’t even wait for my answer and passed by me to hide in a cave nearby.",44,10
1pt3o38,,"I tried to bargain with him, but he wouldn’t budge. I sat in the cave next to him, anxiously staring out of the entrance, praying the blizzard wouldn’t get worse.",30,11
1pt3o38,,"There was a strange drawing on the wall of the cave, a square with two lines extending from it, crossing each other. But like magic, the snow slowly subsided.",29,12
1pt3o38,,"The sky opened up, and a warm sun came from behind the clouds. “See? What did I tell you?” Mark said and walked out.",24,13
1pt3o38,,"I was still a little wary, but this was our best chance to make it up to the cabin.",19,14
1pt3o38,,"We strapped the carabiners, and Mark walked over, this time without an issue. I slowly followed. The rest of the climb was moderate. The cabin was just around the corner.",30,15
1pt3o38,,Then the blizzard came back. Hail was hitting my face. I screamed at Mark to speed up and get to the cabin as soon as possible. Everything slowly turned white.,30,16
1pt3o38,,"Then Mark’s voice screamed through the wind, “John, the cabin’s here!”

Prayer flags were hung all around it. I was surprised that these were the first flags we saw.",29,17
1pt3o38,,"There were many of them on the other mountains, and this one was supposed to be the holiest. “Hey John!” Mark screamed again. I snapped out of it.",28,18
1pt3o38,,He was pointing at the door. There was a lock on it. How was that possible? This should have been opened for everyone. But there was no time to think.,30,19
1pt3o38,,"Mark pulled a knife from his backpack and started pounding on the lock. One, two, three hits. The lock broke. He quickly opened the door, and we both stumbled in.",30,20
1pt3o38,,"Candles were lit around the cabin. Prayer flags hung around the ceiling. “Hi, is anyone in here?” Mark shouted. No answer. Mark looked back and shrugged.",26,21
1pt3o38,,A chill ran down my spine. Mark pulled out his flashlight and climbed up the ladder to the sleeping area.,20,22
1pt3o38,,"“There’s some weird symbol on the wall.”

I walked back to take a closer look. It was a square with two lines extending from it, crossing each other.",28,23
1pt3o38,,It was the one from the cave.,7,24
1pt3o38,,"“Yo, the candles are in the same shape as the thing on the wall.”

Then, strange singing started coming up from the floor beneath us.",25,25
1pt3o38,,It was in a language I couldn’t understand. The singing was loud and throaty with a strange raspiness. We looked at each other in bewilderment.,25,26
1pt3o38,,Then the symbol on the wall began glowing in a bright white light. It shone right into Mark’s face.,19,27
1pt3o38,,His eyes then slowly widened and rolled up back into his head. He fell to the floor. “Mark!” I screamed out and ran to him.,25,28
1pt3o38,,His body started shivering and foaming at the mouth. A seizure? Mark didn’t have epilepsy.,15,29
1pt3o38,,"I got on my knees, rolled his body to the side, and put a bag under his head. He started seizing more.",22,30
1pt3o38,,"I frantically got our backpacks and started searching for the first-aid kit, knowing there wasn’t anything to help him. The trapdoor opened.",22,31
1pt3o38,,"People with long dark hair, beards, and clothing with strange necklaces began crawling out of it. They looked around the room and down at Mark.",25,32
1pt3o38,,One of them pointed at his hand. He had an open wound on it. They started arguing among themselves.,19,33
1pt3o38,,"Another one of them, a man with a larger set of necklaces and tattoos on his face, pointed at the symbol.",21,34
1pt3o38,,"I tried to tell them again that I needed to help my friend, but they wouldn’t listen. I could see genuine anger in their faces.",25,35
1pt3o38,,"They began screaming, pulled out knives, and began coming closer to us. Shock ran down my spine. Then Mark’s body sat upright. His eyes were still rolled back.",28,36
1pt3o38,,"He began roaring at the people, his voice deep and rusty. They stopped, got on their knees, and started bowing down to him.",23,37
1pt3o38,,"The roaring began getting louder until my ears started ringing. Mark then stood up, looking among the men.",18,38
1pt3o38,,"He pointed at one of them and outstretched his hand, motioning it upwards. As he did so, the man’s body began levitating, floating in the air.",26,39
1pt3o38,,The man wore a smile of contempt and happiness.,9,40
1pt3o38,,"Then Mark clenched his fist, and the man’s head slowly caved in on itself and exploded, his brain splattered all over the room.",23,41
1pt3o38,,"My legs started shaking, and I let out a gasp. The other men were still bowed on the ground, with no reaction to what had happened to their companion.",29,42
1pt3o38,,"I started slowly backing away, trying to reach the door, but as my hand touched the handle, Mark quickly turned away.",21,43
1pt3o38,,"He now pointed in my direction, started roaring, and outstretched his hand. My body then began levitating in the air. It was getting harder to breathe.",26,44
1pt3o38,,"“Mark…Mark…st…op.”

He then started slowly clenching his fist, and immense painful pressure formed in my head; my ears started popping. My world started turning black.",25,45
1pt3o38,,"I tried to call his name again. Then his eyes rolled back. My body fell to the ground. “Wha…What’s going on?”

“Mark, Mark!”

“John…?”

The men started singing again.",29,46
1pt3o38,,"Mark’s body began shivering. He fell to his knees and let out an agonizing scream, his eyes rolled right back into his head.",23,47
1pt3o38,,I didn’t wait around this time and opened the door and stumbled outside of the cabin into the blizzard. My heart was beating out of my chest.,27,48
1pt3o38,,"I ran as fast as I could, not looking back. The roars echoed through the wind. The hail was hitting my face. The wind felt so cold on my skin.",30,49
1pt3o38,,"I reached King’s Ridge. The roar was getting closer. I crossed swiftly, not caring if I fell. Halfway across, I saw an outline of a human next to me.",29,50
1pt3o38,,"My body froze with fear. Then the silhouette slipped, and a scream echoed through the mountain. First sounding like the roar, but then slowly turning to Mark.",27,51
1pt3o38,,"I managed to cross the ridge and hid in the cave next to it, shivering. Two other explorers found me after the blizzard subsided and called the mountain service.",29,52
1pt3o38,,"I was becoming hypothermic, but managed to survive. The mountain service explored the mountains. There were the bodies of the three men in the cabin with their heads exploded.",29,53
1pt3o38,,"They never found Mark’s body. I’m sitting in a hotel room now, awaiting the interrogation tomorrow. The walls are thin here. I can hear someone singing next door.",28,54

1pt33kb,,"With no job or responsibilities, I started going for long walks around my neighborhood, daydreaming about all the ways I could reinvent myself: move to Hollywood and live out of my car while working on my screenplays, sell all my possessions and travel the country in a van.",48,4
1pt33kb,,It was during one of these walks that I saw the man. We were on Bernard Street and walking toward each other.,22,5
1pt33kb,,"The middle of winter, and yet, he wore a t-shirt and shorts.",12,6
1pt33kb,,"When he walked past me I felt a surge of heat and fetid air, like an oven full of plastic had just opened.",23,7
1pt33kb,,I turned around in time to see him crossing the street. An SUV ran a stop sign as the man walked out in front of it.,26,8
1pt33kb,,"I screamed and threw my hands in the air, but the car passed right through him. The car moved steadily ahead, and the man continued walking.",26,9
1pt33kb,,"It was only then, staring at him with my mouth agape, that I realized: the man was somewhat opaque, not obviously so, but enough that I could look through him and vaguely make out dark shadows.",36,10
1pt33kb,,"I watched the ghost until he turned the corner, then I followed. I rounded the bend in time to see him walking toward an abandoned house on the right.",29,11
1pt33kb,,He entered the front yard and disappeared. I was stuck in place and breathing hard when a voice came from behind me.,22,12
1pt33kb,,"“You can see him too, can’t you?”

I turned around to see a tall, handsome man about my age, with curly blond hair and brown eyes.",26,13
1pt33kb,,"He looked down at me and smiled like I’d done something surprisingly cute. A kid who solved a math problem she hadn’t been taught in school. “Yes,” I said.",29,14

“Your guess is as good as mine. You followed him, right?”

I nodded. “He’s always walking the same path, but he disappears right here.",27,15
1pt33kb,,"I think it’s where he used to live.”

“What makes you think that?”

“Where else would you spend your afterlife trying to reach?” He shrugged. “My name’s Charles.",28,16
1pt33kb,,"You want to get a cup of coffee?”

I laughed, and he flinched as if I’d hit him. “I’ll take that as a no?” he asked.",26,17
1pt33kb,,"“Yes!” I said, too sharply. “I mean, no. You shouldn’t take it as a no. My name’s Sarah.",18,18
1pt33kb,,"Let’s get a cup of coffee and… you can tell me more about the ghost?”

“I don’t know anything else.",20,19
1pt33kb,,"But I can tell you more about me.”

I’m not sure if I said yes because I liked his smile, or because I didn’t want to give up the adventure.",30,20
1pt33kb,,We spent the 10-minute walk to Collective Coffee making awkward small talk about our lives and hobbies. He was an accountant who spent his free time hiking and rock climbing.,30,21

1pt33kb,,"The walls were covered with black and white portraits of couples and families, and next to the menu above the counter there was a blown-up image of a newspaper article touting the shop as winner of the city’s 1984 “best cup of coffee” competition.",44,24
1pt33kb,,The place was empty aside from an old man and woman sitting in the far corner by the bathroom and a barista with pink hair who stood at the counter and greeted us as we approached.,36,25
1pt33kb,,"I smiled at her and looked up to study the menu. I was thinking about either a latte or a cappuccino, but then Charles was already ordering his Americano.",29,26
1pt33kb,,"\\\\\\\*Rude,\\\\\\\* I thought. “And she’ll have… a chai tea latte?” He finished. “Uh, sure.”

The girl gave me a sympathetic look, then went to make our drinks.",27,27
1pt33kb,,"A few minutes later we were sitting down at a round table in the front. “So, how often do you see ghosts?” Charles asked.",24,28
1pt33kb,,"“Not often,” I didn’t want him to know that this was the first time. “I’ve been seeing them since I was little,” he said, looking down at his drink.",29,29

1pt33kb,,"“So… what happened to your mom?”

“She died.”

“Oh… yeah. Um, do you see ghosts every day?”

“Only when I’ve been out mushroom hunting.”

“Mushroom hunting?”

“Yeah.",27,32
1pt33kb,,"I like to search around trails and forests for rare mushrooms. Sometimes I eat the edible ones.”

It took me a second to get it.",25,33
1pt33kb,,He looked worried until I started laughing. I made some excuse about my parents needing my help at home.,19,34
1pt33kb,,"Before I could leave he said, “let’s get dinner… Tuesday night?”

When I took a moment to reply he said, “We can talk about… whatever.”

“Sure,” I said.",28,35

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\*\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\*\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\*

Dinner went okay. He was sweet but awkward; he kept teetering on the edge of telling me something about ghosts.",24,36
1pt33kb,,"He’d say something like, “sometimes they look, well…” and then go silent before changing the subject. It was like he wasn’t sure if he could trust me.",27,37

1pt33kb,,"Sometimes we’d get dinner, other times it was coffee, a movie, or a walk.",14,39
1pt33kb,,"I can’t say I ever liked him that much, at least not romantically, but there was a certain dependency that started not long after the first dinner date.",28,40
1pt33kb,,"To some degree, I felt close to him because of the power we shared. But he also had this anxious desperation.",21,41
1pt33kb,,"He hid it well with his smiles and cheesy jokes, but I could tell by how \\\\\\\*hard\\\\\\\* he tried that he was holding his breath with me, or on the edge of his seat, silently begging me not to go.",40,42
1pt33kb,,He paid for things and opened doors; he gave me flowers and chocolate.,13,43
1pt33kb,,"When it was time to say goodbye each night, he’d grab my hand and hold it for just a little too long.",22,44
1pt33kb,,"Before letting go, he’d squeeze hard, as if considering pulling me in.",12,45
1pt33kb,,"So when one day Charles asked me if I wanted to go back to his apartment, I said yes.",19,46
1pt33kb,,"Not because I felt that I had to, and not because I thought he would be mad if I said no, but because I wanted to be there for him.",30,47
1pt33kb,,"I wanted to see where he lived, what he kept in his fridge, what he had on his walls, what his room smelled like, I wanted to understand him.",29,48
1pt33kb,,"He had no welcome mat or decorations, just a TV, a couch, and some books stacked against the wall. No kitchen table, no recliner, no place to put our shoes.",30,49
1pt33kb,,"“You sure know how to live,” I said. He laughed. “When I was a kid, I spent all my time inside. I didn’t get the chance to experience much.",29,50
1pt33kb,,"So, when I started living on my own, I decided I’d spend as much time outside as possible.",18,51
1pt33kb,,"No need for a lot when I’m barely here.”

We sat down on the couch and talked for a while. I don’t remember what about.",25,52
1pt33kb,,What I do remember is the way his eyes softened and his lips parted slowly. How he lowered his chin in a way that made him look like a child.,30,53
1pt33kb,,"I remember, better than I remember anything else, how softly he asked me:

“Will you please try to find me?”

“What?”

“I want you to go outside, count to 10, then come inside and find me.”

Something about the way he asked made it so I couldn’t say no.",49,54
1pt33kb,,"I went outside and closed the door behind me. Standing outside in the dark, I was cold and shivering. My heart was pounding and I couldn’t catch my breath.",29,55
1pt33kb,,"I contemplated running to my car and just forgetting about Charles. I mean, I’d really only known him for a few weeks at this point.",25,56
1pt33kb,,"Why did he so desperately need me to play this game? I should have just left, but… I had to know where this was going.",25,57
1pt33kb,,When I finished counting I opened the door and scanned the living room. I took a step forward and the sound echoed off the bare walls.,26,58
1pt33kb,,I imagined Charles hiding just around the corner. He suddenly had a knife and a rope. He knew exactly where I was. He was waiting. My throat tightened.,28,59
1pt33kb,,"The door slammed shut behind me and I cried out. I wanted to leave, but no… it was just a game. I laughed at myself for being so ridiculous.",29,60
1pt33kb,,"I took my shoes off before taking another step. The apartment was small and there weren’t a lot of places to hide, but I took my time.",27,61
1pt33kb,,"I checked behind the couch, under the bed, behind the shower curtain. Each time I turned a corner or opened a door my body was tensed to run.",28,62
1pt33kb,,When I opened the towel closet I found him curled into a ball under the shelf. He was rocking himself back and forth and crying.,25,63
1pt33kb,,"I reached for him, and he straightened his legs and scooted out. I helped him get to his feet, and he just stared at me.",25,64
1pt33kb,,"His eyes were wide and he was shaking. For a moment neither of us moved, but when he took a shaky breath, I leaned in and kissed him.",28,65
1pt33kb,,I didn’t know how else to make him feel better. We had sex that night. I was on top of him with my hands on his chest.,27,66
1pt33kb,,I looked straight ahead at the wall the whole time. When we were done we laid next to each other. When he fell asleep I got up and went home.,30,67

1pt33kb,,"We were about halfway through when he gently grabbed my chin, turned me toward him, and kissed me. I pulled away on instinct. “Sorry,” I said.",26,69
1pt33kb,,"“I just… really like this movie.”

We watched for a little longer, then he paused the TV and said, “Can I tell you something?”

“Of course.”

He took a deep breath.",31,70
1pt33kb,,"Charles saw a ghost for the first time while playing in the backyard with his mom. Only, he didn’t realize it was a ghost.",24,71
1pt33kb,,He thought it was funny that the yellow dog kept walking back and forth from the big tree to their back door.,22,72
1pt33kb,,"When he perfectly described the dog that had died before he was born, was buried under the tree, and that he had absolutely not seen any pictures of, his mom brought him inside and prayed over him for hours.",39,73
1pt33kb,,"Later, when he began talking about a “grey man” in the house, she beat him so badly that he was kept out of school for a week for fear of teachers taking notice.",33,74

1pt33kb,,"Only, she got smarter about how she dished them out; she hit him in places where no one could see the evidence.",22,76
1pt33kb,,"She said she was beating the demons out of him. He started hiding every time his mom drank, or when he knew she’d be coming home late from the bar.",30,77
1pt33kb,,"She’d walk into the house screaming his name. Sometimes, if he hid really well, it would take her an hour to find him.",23,78
1pt33kb,,"But she would never stop looking until she did. “Even now,” he said, “part of me feels… loved. She always looked for me so hard.",25,79
1pt33kb,,Like I mattered to her more than anything else in the world. She wanted to find me and beat me because she thought she could cure me.,27,80
1pt33kb,,"If she hated me she could have just kicked me out or killed me, you know? She never stopped looking, and she never stopped trying.",25,81
1pt33kb,,"Until she died.”

It happened when he was 12. She came home after a long night at the bar and found him quickly because he wasn’t hiding at all.",29,82
1pt33kb,,He was sitting on the couch waiting for her.,9,83
1pt33kb,,"She went to slap him, but when her arm was just an inch from his face, he caught her by the wrist, squeezed hard, looked her in the eyes, and told her \\\\\\\*no.\\\\\\\*

When she tried to hit him with her other hand, he caught that one too.",48,84
1pt33kb,,"He let go, and she tried to hit him again and again. Each time he stopped her. He didn’t hit her back, but for the first time, he defended himself.",30,85
1pt33kb,,"She ran to her room sobbing. “I should’ve just hid,” he said.",12,86

But in the morning it was he who found her, dead in her bed.",26,87
1pt33kb,,"There was another her checking in closets and behind furniture. “I’m right here,” he told her. She turned.",18,88
1pt33kb,,"“You found me.”

She walked toward him like she always did, eyes narrowed and fist raised to strike.",18,89
1pt33kb,,"But when she brought that fist down, it went swiftly through him like a knife through a thin layer of smoke.",21,90
1pt33kb,,"She tried to hit him again and again as she screamed like a banshee. He backed away. “Why do you want to hurt me!?”

“There’s a demon inside you!",29,91
1pt33kb,,"You need to stop talking to ghosts!” 

“You’re a ghost!”

He ran out of the house and called the police.",20,92
1pt33kb,,"But as he looked through the front window, he saw her peeking behind the TV with her arm reared back.",20,93
1pt33kb,,"When he was done talking, I told him to hide, and that night I looked for him harder than ever.",20,94
1pt33kb,,"For weeks after, almost every night, I’d search for him and we'd end up in bed.",16,95
1pt33kb,,"I didn’t particularly like the strange game of hide-and-seek, but I didn’t hate it either. It made him happy. I really did want him to be happy.",27,96
1pt33kb,,"Even if I didn’t love him like he loved me. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\*\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\*\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\*

One day, we were hiking through a trail he’d been begging to take me to for weeks.",28,97
1pt33kb,,"It was special to him, and he kept stopping to tell me facts about different plants and wildlife. It was so mind-numbingly boring.",23,98
1pt33kb,,I kept trying to steer the conversation toward ghosts.,9,99
1pt33kb,,"I asked him if he could see any right now, or if he could sense any nearby, but all he would say was something like “that’s not how it works” before saying something about the trail.",36,100
1pt33kb,,He had just finished explaining the lineage of some tree when I came right out and said it. “I’m starting to get bored.,23,101
1pt33kb,,"Will you take me to see your mom?” 

I think we both knew that I was being intentionally vague about what exactly I was getting bored of.",27,102
1pt33kb,,I could see the fear in his eyes. He swallowed hard before answering. “Okay.,14,103
1pt33kb,,"But only once.”

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\*\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\*\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\*

We went on a Wednesday in the early afternoon so that the family who lived there would all be at school or work.",27,104
1pt33kb,,"It was a square house on the corner of Bernard Street. Brown brick, three steps up to the patio and front door.",22,105
1pt33kb,,We walked through the grass to the right side of the house and looked in through the kitchen windows.,19,106
1pt33kb,,"While the house was foundationally no different from the average suburban home, the owners had made it their own in a way that was beautiful.",25,107
1pt33kb,,The counter in front of the window held a yellow coffee mug with crudely drawn black lines meant to resemble a bee.,22,108
1pt33kb,,The fridge was covered with crayon drawings and A+ grades. There were five chairs circled around the kitchen table.,19,109
1pt33kb,,"When I looked over at Charles, his face was pressed against the glass, his breath fogged the space in front of his lips. “Is she here?” I asked.",28,110
1pt33kb,,"“I don’t see her.”

Charles only nodded. “What… what is she doing?”

“Just… walking.”

I closed my eyes and tried to imagine it.",23,111
1pt33kb,,"A cursed, phantom lady roaming the home, fist-raised, a fiery anger in her eyes as she hunted for her kid in a house full of others.",26,112
1pt33kb,,I wondered if any of them ever saw her. Or if she saw them.,14,113
1pt33kb,,"After a few moments Charles said, “We better get going before someone sees us,” and we began walking aimlessly down the street.",22,114
1pt33kb,,"“Why do you think she’s still there?” I asked. “Trauma, I guess. Or purpose. Maybe they’re the same thing.",19,115
1pt33kb,,"I mean, I was my mom’s trauma, and her purpose was to stop me, right?”

“How come I can’t see her?",21,116
1pt33kb,,"And how come I can see the one on the street? I don’t understand.”

“I don’t either. But you’re not like me. I see ghosts all the time.",28,117
1pt33kb,,"You only see the one, right?”

“Yeah. But what’s so special about that one?”

“I don’t know. Maybe you’re connected somehow.” He paused for a moment before finishing.",28,118
1pt33kb,,"“Please don’t make me take you back here again.”

That night I looked for Charles, and when I found him, he cried so hard that I couldn’t do anything but just hold his head in my lap and brush his hair.",41,119
1pt33kb,,It was the first time I felt guilty about us. Did he realize how transactional our relationship was? I thought he did.,22,120
1pt33kb,,"“I’m sorry,” I said, hoping he knew what I meant. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\*\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\*\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\*

Around that time, I found a full-time job as an SAT/ACT tutor.",23,121
1pt33kb,,"Charles was the first person I called when I got the news. “I’m so excited for you,” he said. “You deserve it so much, and I know you’ll do great.",30,122
1pt33kb,,"How about dinner tonight to celebrate?”

He pulled out all the stops. We had steak and wine, then chocolate cake for dessert.",22,123
1pt33kb,,He kept telling me that I was so smart and so qualified. He said it so many times that I was starting to feel like he doubted it.,28,124
1pt33kb,,At the end of the night he walked me to my car.,12,125
1pt33kb,,"When we were saying goodbye he looked at me so pleadingly, the way he did when he wanted me to go back to his place and find him.",28,126
1pt33kb,,"But he could tell that I was tired and he was too sweet to ask. Instead, he gave me a tight hug and squeezed my hand.",26,127
1pt33kb,,I found myself enjoying my job and looking forward to sessions with students.,13,128
1pt33kb,,For the first time in a while I felt as though I had a purpose: helping kids get into college.,20,129
1pt33kb,,I spent so much more than 40 hours a week on my work. I made detailed plans for each student.,20,130
1pt33kb,,I imagined how excited they would be when they finally got their goal scores. It took up almost all my time. I loved it.,24,131
1pt33kb,,"I still cared for Charles, but I was getting bored, and the newfound purpose made it hard to ignore the guilt. So I began drifting away from him.",28,132
1pt33kb,,We went from going to his apartment every day to hanging out once a week.,15,133
1pt33kb,,"Whenever we were together I had this heavy feeling in my chest, like I was mourning something.",17,134
1pt33kb,,"Once a week turned to every other week, and I could tell that he realized what was happening. Sometimes there were tears in his eyes when we parted ways.",29,135
1pt33kb,,"Eventually we were just texting every few days, like old college friends. How’s work? Good. You? Good.",17,136
1pt33kb,,"This continued for a while, but as I settled into the routine of my job, I was bored again. The students seemed to get dumber and less motivated over time.",30,137
1pt33kb,,"It was frustrating to explain the same thing over and over, week after week in all kinds of different ways.",20,138
1pt33kb,,"They just wouldn’t learn, and yet their parents blamed me when their scores didn’t increase.",15,139
1pt33kb,,"After a while, I decided there wasn’t a point in what I was doing after all. There was no purpose. Just a job.",23,140
1pt33kb,,I started going to see the street ghost on my own. I started to think of him as \\\\\\\*my\\\\\\\* ghost.,20,141
1pt33kb,,"My personal reminder that there was more to the world than test scores and bratty teenagers. I became braver, more used to him.",23,142
1pt33kb,,"I’d walk directly behind him, copying his every move.",9,143
1pt33kb,,"As we neared the old house, I’d close my eyes and keep walking, imagining that I was him, finishing the steps that he couldn’t.",24,144
1pt33kb,,All the time I wondered what the ghost’s trauma was. But after a while I started to want more. It wasn’t fair.,22,145
1pt33kb,,"Why did Charles get to see all these ghosts all the time, and I only had the one? So I reached out to him again.",25,146
1pt33kb,,"I texted him and waited a few days, but he didn’t answer. I couldn’t blame him.",16,147
1pt33kb,,"After all, the last text he’d sent me was asking if I wanted to get dinner. Two weeks later, and I’d never replied.",23,148
1pt33kb,,"When I got tired of waiting, I drove to his apartment. I knocked on his door, waited a few minutes, then went home.",23,149
1pt33kb,,"I tried again the next day, and the next. Eventually I got angry. I treated him like a video game that wasn’t working.",23,150
1pt33kb,,"He was the reason I couldn’t have my fun, my excitement. And there was only one of him. I couldn’t go buy another copy.",24,151
1pt33kb,,"So, one day, after sitting outside his apartment for hours, I just… opened the door. I called his name.",19,152
1pt33kb,,"I shouted that it was me; I said I just wanted to make sure he was okay. He didn’t answer, so I walked inside and started looking.",27,153
1pt33kb,,"I found myself checking all the places he used to hide back when we were together: behind the couch, in the bedroom closet, under his bed.",26,154
1pt33kb,,"When I walked into his bathroom, the smell hit me. He was lying in the tub, curled into a ball yet so flat that he was almost sinking into it.",30,155
1pt33kb,,Trailing down his wrists were thick lines of dried blood that pooled underneath him. Sitting next to him was another Charles. He looked at me with a blank expression.,29,156
1pt33kb,,"“You found me,” he said. “Oh God,” I cried, falling back against the sink. “What happened to you?”

He didn’t answer.",21,157
1pt33kb,,"“Why didn’t you tell me you were going to do this? I could have helped you, couldn’t I have?”

He didn’t respond. “Why… why are you still here?",28,158
1pt33kb,,"Are you… like your mom, and the man on the street?”

“Things are different.”

“Are they better?”

He didn’t answer for so long that I almost asked again.",28,159
1pt33kb,,"“No,” he said. “Are you choosing to hide? Could you move on… somewhere else?”

“If I go, then who will find me?”

“I don’t know,” I said.",27,160
1pt33kb,,"“I’m sorry.”

He was silent after that. I had to fight the urge to break down and scream. After some time he stood up and walked out of the bathroom.",30,161
1pt33kb,,"Slow and focused, like the ghost on the street. I counted to 10. When I found him behind the couch he smiled.",22,162
1pt33kb,,"“You found me.”

“Charles… isn’t… isn’t there a way for me to help you?”

But he was already looking for a new place to hide.",25,163
1pt33kb,,"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\*\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\*\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\*

I still watch the man on the street. When I’m particularly sad, I follow him until he disappears, then I close my eyes and keep walking.",27,164
1pt33kb,,I don’t pretend that I’m him anymore. I let the heat and the smell of death wash over me. I think of my future; I think of my past.,29,165
1pt33kb,,"I ask myself, sometimes over and over:

Will I be here [forever?](",12,166
1psu9yy,God Rest Ye Merry,It had been a couple of days near the end of Christmastide when the government broadcast came that would change my life forever.,23,0
1psu9yy,,"Now, I was nothing more than a nipper when it happened, so forgive me, my most esteemed reader, as my recollection is hazy—true to most of this period of my life, and, if I am being honest, with the entirety of my life.",43,1
1psu9yy,,"Still, I will do my best to relate a cohesive narrative of the events that happened that night.",18,2
1psu9yy,,"I also understand that what I am about to type out and share with the broader world beyond the limits of my facility will seem… well, the ramblings of a mad man, but I assure you I am not that.",40,3
1psu9yy,,"This truly happened to my family and me. I am sure of that, and what I saw is very much real, even if my doctors do not believe so.",29,4
1psu9yy,,"I distinctly remember being nestled deep against the warm fabric that lay over my mother’s bosom, my favourite stuffed animal, an anthropomorphic crocodile from some movie that’s long been erased from even the deepest recesses of my mind, against my own, as her supple fingers scurried through my hair.",49,5
1psu9yy,,"We were supposed to be wearing matching ugly Christmas sweaters for the party, but my mother had bought a size one too large.",23,6
1psu9yy,,"And so we just lay there, watching some horrendous festive B-movie. I felt relatively calm.",15,7
1psu9yy,,"My eyes were drowsy, and the sound of my own breath, mixed with the shimmering of the lights strewn across our tree and the oh-so-soothing crackles of the embers, was somniferous.",31,8
1psu9yy,,Then my eyes crept open slightly as a frizzled-looking bureaucrat with loose skin replaced the movie.,16,9
1psu9yy,,"The officialdom of my city had declared that all forms of merriment, all vibrant colours, and any upbeat or jovial music were to cease immediately.",25,10
1psu9yy,,"They did not specify why, just that it needed to be done, lest we all want to die; lest we all want to live in agony; lest we all want to be disappointed; lest we all wish never to receive a gift again; lest we all want to live an outcast life.",52,11
1psu9yy,,"I had asked my mother, with a characteristic, tired juvenile curiosity, what the man meant. She couldn’t explain it.",19,12
1psu9yy,,"She had gotten up, sat me down in the chair, put a festive blanket over me, and told me she needed to call my father.",25,13
1psu9yy,,"I believe I had sat there for quite a while, drifting off again, when I heard a pounding off a ways away. BAMBAM!",23,14
1psu9yy,,"I wanted to see, but like the dutiful son I was, I stayed put. BAMBAMBAM! The knocking had gotten more intense.",21,15
1psu9yy,,"My heart had skipped a beat; even as young as I was, with my social reasoning just barely developed, I could still parse the evident ire in each of those knocks.",31,16
1psu9yy,,"I tried sinking myself deeper into the couch cushion, and one foot succeeded.",13,17
1psu9yy,,"I desperately craved the safe and intimate embrace of my mother, and I thought my wish had been granted when she came back into the living room.",27,18
1psu9yy,,"But to my horror, she had skipped past me and headed down the hallway to where our front door resided.",20,19
1psu9yy,,"I heard the rattle of the lock, then the creak of the door opening. “Hello,” my mother had said.",19,20
1psu9yy,,“What can I do for you this—” A feminine scream filled my ears. My mother was pushed onto her fundament. She was now curled against the wall.,27,21
1psu9yy,,"Seeing her as terrified as I was made me even more frightened. There was a rhythmic *thumpthumpthumpthumpthump*, and men, reminiscent of soldiery, marched into the living room.",27,22
1psu9yy,,They began tearing down our tree and smashing ornaments with little care for the sanctity of our living space.,19,23
1psu9yy,,"I watched as they tore down everything we owned and threw what they couldn’t easily smash into the fires. One approached me slowly, yet somehow with unnerving steadfastness.",28,24
1psu9yy,,"His uniform was not of the CAF, nor was it American or any other military. To this day, I cannot tell you who these men belong to.",27,25
1psu9yy,,"But the man who approached me was large compared to me, muscle-bound with sallow skin.",15,26
1psu9yy,,"He tried to give a friendly smile, but those rotten teeth only made him more unsettling. “Hey there, kid,” he had said.",22,27
1psu9yy,,"“I’m going to have to take the toy.”

“No!” I protested. “You can’t take Mr. Smiley.”

“That name is the reason I have to!” he said.",26,28
1psu9yy,,"“So hand it over.”

“No!” I protested again.",8,29
1psu9yy,,"“Damnit, kid!” All semblance of nicety vanished in an instant as he rushed over towards me and tried pulling the toy out of my grasp.",25,30
1psu9yy,,"When he found it to be unusually firm for a kid my age, he had wacked me in the face with no hesitation, so that my grip became limp, and he could whisk my beloved toy away.",37,31
1psu9yy,,"My face began to smart, but I paid no heed to the pain as I watched in abstract horror as he hurried over to the fire, the dancing flames tauntingly trying to grab at Mr Smiley.",36,32
1psu9yy,,“No!” I had shouted.,4,33
1psu9yy,,"I had skittered off the chair and ran towards the man, but my body hit the hardwood as two other men—both of whom were incredibly stout, may I add—leaned their full weight onto my fragile frame.",36,34
1psu9yy,,"The pain was immense. Bruising was inevitable, and I felt my ribcage press tight against my organs.",17,35
1psu9yy,,"But none of the physical pain could prepare me for the mental agony of watching Mr Smiley descend into the hungry flames; they wrapped around him, his soft green skin turning tarlike, and soon enough, he had gone from something I could hold into billows of repugnant smoke.",48,36
1psu9yy,,"I had wept. I had wept harder than I ever had before. My mother started to shout at the men, and they argued and argued and argued.",27,37
1psu9yy,,"Good God, did they argue! For some reason, the men had no reservations about manhandling a nine-year-old, but they would not dare touch my mother.",25,38
1psu9yy,,"In fact, they seemed rather afraid of her. Perhaps it was her bombastic zeal. But whatever the reason, it caused them to slow their rampage.",25,39
1psu9yy,,"“Please, ma’am!” one of them, a younger fellow, pleaded. “This is for your own good…”

“I do not care!” she said. “Get out of my house!",26,40
1psu9yy,,"He needs to come out with the rest of everyone!”

“That is not safe, ma’am. It is best—” There was a rumbling sound.",23,41
1psu9yy,,"“Shit, quick, turn off the lights and put out the flame!” They did so, and my mother swept me up.",20,42
1psu9yy,,Then we crouched behind the chair as the men suddenly had rifles in their arms. The world went quiet. The men lined up neatly.,24,43
1psu9yy,,"They were so still that one could mistake them for toy action figures. Splatter sounds accompanied the rumbling. A bright, intense light lit the room from the hallway.",28,44
1psu9yy,,"It was a serpentine creature made of fetuses and five-week-old babies and little boys and little girls and teenagers and oh God who knows what else, gooey and slimy, with deep, visible pores across its skin that oozed what could only be described as literal shit.",46,45
1psu9yy,,"Yet, it was oddly festive in appearance.",7,46
1psu9yy,,"It had strings of Christmas lights around it with little bows now and again along the line, and atop its body was a nativity scene that had been corrupted to the point that it looked demoniacal.",36,47
1psu9yy,,"It had a mouth of rotting teeth, eyes made of dead Golden Retrievers, and it slithered with jagged movements; I swore I could hear the bemoans of the individuals who made up the monster—but they were not cries for help or screams of agony.",44,48
1psu9yy,,"No, they were Christmas carols that had been lowered in register to create a sombre, macabre melody.",17,49
1psu9yy,,"The men started to fire their guns, shells falling to the floor, but they did not damage the creature.",19,50
1psu9yy,,"“Shit,” one of the men said, “there is still something related to Christmas in here!”

Then my mother was yanked from behind me and thrown into the middle of the room.",31,51
1psu9yy,,"I watched as she slumped, taking little, useless steps backwards. The creature had locked eyes with her Christmas sweater and seemed to beam with excitement.",25,52
1psu9yy,,"Then it rushed forward, and to my horror, a sight for which my hand shakes just trying to type this out, my mother fell into its cavernous maw.",28,53
1psu9yy,,She screamed as green tentacles with little mouths of sharp teeth emerged and wrapped around her.,16,54
1psu9yy,,"Two of the tentacles flew close to her ear and whispered something gently, then she went limp and began mumbling the lyrics to God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen before descending slowly down its gullet.",34,55
1psu9yy,,It grew.,2,56
1psu9yy,,It grew and it grew and it grew and it got bigger and more shit poured out of the holes as it grew so big it threatened to tear the very house around us down.,35,57
1psu9yy,,"The Christmas carols became louder, to the point that to this day, I am astonished I am not hearing-impaired.",19,58
1psu9yy,,"But with my mother gone, there was nothing left in our home that was even remotely merry. The very notion of Yuletide had gone extinct in our household.",28,59
1psu9yy,,"So the men began to fire their rifles, and this time the creature shrank with each hit, shrieking as it did so, till it was no more than the size of me.",32,60
1psu9yy,,"The bullets suddenly stopped working, flinging off its body as it scurried out of the house.",16,61
1psu9yy,,"I do not remember what happened between then and my arrival at the facility I have called my home for the last thirty years of my life, but one thing I do know is that what happened that night was real.",41,62
1psu9yy,,"It had to have been. But I have yet to find anyone who believes me, so here I am, writing this.",21,63
1psu9yy,,"Maybe there is someone out there who has seen the creature, and perhaps I wish to express this experience in a creative way, which I personally find quite enjoyable.",29,64
1psu9yy,,"Either way, I hope to reach someone out there who is willing to talk to me, listen, or even relay a similar experience.",23,65
1psu9yy,,But I will say this: I am the reason my facility does not celebrate Christmas.,15,66

But as I stood up, I heard a scream.",27,29
1psti9l,,"It was muffled, coming through the air vents, vibrating the metal slats. It didn't sound like a recording. It sounded like Miller.",22,30
1psti9l,,"I looked over at the side office, hoping to see him sitting there, but his chair is empty.",18,31
1psti9l,,"The pile of Monster cans is still there, and his phone is still on the desk, plugged into its charger.",20,32
1psti9l,,"The screen is glowing in the dark, playing a TikTok on a loop.",13,33
1psti9l,,"The same six-second audio clip is repeating over and over, but the pitch is dropping, sounding more like a distorted, guttural chant every time it restarts. I’m an SFC.",29,34

1psrd32,"I visited the Florida Everglades, and my only souvenir was a supernatural stalker.",I know it's still out there. Something followed me home when I returned from my trip last week.,18,0
1psrd32,,"That thing, it was in the swamp, I did something there, and it followed me all this way. I don't know how much longer I have.",26,1
1psrd32,,But I need to tell someone what happened before it's too late. Last week I was visiting family in Florida.,20,2
1psrd32,,"It was a nice time to go, since it's freezing here this time of year, so the trip would be a good vacation.",23,3
1psrd32,,"I grew up in Florida, but moved away when I was eighteen. I had not been back to visit my family for several years.",24,4
1psrd32,,It seemed like a good time to go and after visiting I was going to meet up with an old friend from school. Lewis and I grew up together.,29,5
1psrd32,,He was my best friend for years before I moved away. He stayed when I left and eventually we fell out of touch.,23,6
1psrd32,,Now he was living in a small house near the Everglades doing some sort of ecology or environmental research.,19,7
1psrd32,,"I realized I had never been to the Everglades before, so it would be good to see him again and check it out for the first time.",27,8
1psrd32,,I called him up and he was happy to hear I would be in his neck of the woods.,19,9
1psrd32,,"After spending some time with my family near Orlando, I started the long trek south to see what sort of place Lewis had taken up near the state's' most famous stretch of wetlands.",33,10
1psrd32,,I finally got to the muddy driveway and did not see his house. I figured it must be further down the path.,22,11
1psrd32,,I stepped out and was surprised how it still felt humid despite the fact it was nearing wintertime.,18,12
1psrd32,,I walked a bit then saw a figure coming down the path to meet me.,15,13
1psrd32,,"Despite the beard and the fact that he was balding a bit, I knew it was him right away.",19,14
1psrd32,,"I was already smiling as he approached and he was chuckling,

“Man, it's been too long, how the hell are ya?” I shook his hand and clapped him on the back and returned the greeting,

“Yeah it has, not too bad, how about yourself?”

He chuckled again,

“Ah you know, dodging gators and making moonshine, living the dream as they say.",61,15
1psrd32,,"It's an honest life.” He tried to sound serious for a moment, but we both laughed at the same time and we walked the rest of the way to his small house.",32,16
1psrd32,,I was surprised by the hike and why he said not to bring my car any further.,17,17
1psrd32,,"I was about to ask but he read my mind,

“Road sucks out here, don't want you to get stuck.",20,18
1psrd32,,"I sold my car last year, got the old airboat for getting around.",13,19
1psrd32,,"Works with the stuff I need, I just Uber anywhere else or get delivery, which many of the drivers don't appreciate.” He grinned and I believed him, this place was rough to reach.",33,20
1psrd32,,We finally arrived at a haggard-looking building that tottered above the shifting swamp on a wooden catwalk.,17,21
1psrd32,,"After looking at it, I had to ask,

“Why here?” He paused as if considering, then answered,

“It’s fine for my purposes, it's close to the areas of significance for my research, the ecology grant money has got to go somewhere so why not me?",45,22
1psrd32,,"I got a nice stipend from FSU, it's not much but I just have to do my research and put up with the mosquitos and that's that.” He smiled and I appreciated the simplicity that he apparently wanted.",38,23
1psrd32,,We went inside and it was a bit of a mess to say the least.,15,24
1psrd32,,"Garbage, beer bottles, and the smell of even stronger alcohol made me think the moonshine comment was legitimate.",18,25
1psrd32,,"He shrugged as we walked in,

“Sorry, was a little busy, couldn't tidy up.",14,26
1psrd32,,But take a seat and Il grab ya a beer.” He shuffled to the kitchen and I looked around at more of the controlled chaos that was his living and work space.,32,27
1psrd32,,"Papers were strewn all over the floor. As I looked, I almost cried out when I saw what appeared to be a large, motionless Alligator.",25,28
1psrd32,,I relaxed when I saw the gator was just a taxidermied one.,12,29
1psrd32,,Lewis returned with a few luke warm Miller’s and we cracked them open and spent some time reminiscing about the past.,21,30
1psrd32,,"After a while Lewis suggested something that sounded cool,

“Hey man, why don't we take the air boat for a ride, it's a little loud but it's fun and we can explore a bit.",34,31
1psrd32,,"It's kind of like being a pirate on the open seas, except instead of wind and sails it's swamp water and loud engines.” He smiled and despite the bad sales pitch it did sound fun.",35,32
1psrd32,,"We walked outside and down a small dock to a moored airboat, the large fan looked rusted and the thing swayed and shifted on the dark brackish waters.",28,33
1psrd32,,I took a closer look at the surrounding area and was surprised.,12,34
1psrd32,,"When I imagined the Everglades, I had the image of the nicer spots of wetlands where manatees swam, but it just so happened that Lewis’s house was by the more “Swampish” sections.",32,35
1psrd32,,"I did not want to voice my concern about the location, or that his boat looked like it could barely stay afloat.",22,36
1psrd32,,"Fortunately, once we stepped on and the fan roared to life, I did not worry about my esthetic concerns or anything beyond how loud the fan was.",27,37
1psrd32,,We were on the water and moving in no time. I had to admit it was a little fun as we sped around the channels of water.,27,38
1psrd32,,"No one else seemed to be out and about just then, so it felt like the entire area was ours.",20,39
1psrd32,,"As we were moving along at speed, I spotted a sign that concerned me though.",15,40
1psrd32,,"It looked like a warning sign and I swear I saw the faded words, 

“Keep out!” I turned back to Lewis,

“Hey man, I think that sign said we aren't supposed to be in this area.” He waved his hand and scoffed,

“Nah its cool, it's just something that the tribe puts up to keep out poachers and other undesirables, its okay.",62,41
1psrd32,,We aren't here to do any of that.,8,42
1psrd32,,"Most of this area is still Seminole land and I respect it, though I do pass through on occasion for a short cut.” He grinned again and I did not know if I believed him that it was “Okay” with them, but I let it go.",46,43
1psrd32,,"We slowed down a bit. The engine stuttered, and the fan died for a moment. Lewis grumbled,

“Damn thing, piece of crap engine.",23,44
1psrd32,,"I just fixed it.” He started taking a closer look at the stalled fan and as he worked, I looked around.",21,45
1psrd32,,"The area was preternaturally dark compared to the other spots, and I noticed the heavy canopy of trees overhead in this area particularly.",23,46
1psrd32,,"As we floated there, motionless I took in the sights and sounds. Then I thought I heard something else, besides the buzz of insects and the splashing of fish.",29,47
1psrd32,,"It sounded like....crying? I strained my hearing, and I heard it again. Someone was crying for help.",17,48
1psrd32,,"I turned to Lewis and grabbed his shoulder,

“Hey do you hear that?” He stopped what he was doing and listened.",21,49
1psrd32,,"“Mmmm I think so.”

“I think someone needs help, just over there. I heard someone crying, let's go.",18,50
1psrd32,,"Do you have any oars or even a big stick to push us along?” I asked, anxious to investigate.",19,51
1psrd32,,He pulled out a pair of paddles and I started slowly propelling us towards the sound.,16,52
1psrd32,,"The sounds grew louder as we progressed, and I tried to paddle as fast as I could, while Lewis continued trying to fix the engine.",25,53
1psrd32,,"We made it into a shadowy section of mangroves, and it was getting harder to see.",16,54
1psrd32,,"I pushed us along, all the while Lewis was trying to do something with the fan and complaining about the lack of light.",23,55
1psrd32,,"The cry rang out again and as we looked on, we saw a strange glow near a small inlet that housed what looked like a single burning torch and some strange stones.",32,56
1psrd32,,"I looked to Lewis and he shrugged,

“Not sure. Wish I knew what it was.”

I got the boat closer to what I hoped was solid land.",27,57
1psrd32,,"As we neared the edge of the small island, we heard a loud cracking and breaking sound. Lewis groaned in irritation,

“Shit, that better not have broken the hull.",29,58
1psrd32,,"It sounded bad.” We couldn't check just yet, but I agreed. I looked over the edge and saw what we had apparently struck.",23,59
1psrd32,,It was a small stone statue that was half submerged in the water.,13,60
1psrd32,,The boat had broken off the top half of whatever it was and the other portion was still floating on the surface of the surprisingly clear water.,27,61
1psrd32,,"The piece looked odd, it had natural striations, but also a strange suggestive set of grooves which looked like they might have been carved into it.",26,62
1psrd32,,"As I looked at it, I felt an odd sensation.",10,63
1psrd32,,"My ears suddenly popped and there was a strange feeling of decompression, like pressure was being let out in the air around us.",23,64
1psrd32,,"I looked back at Lewis, but he must not have noticed it.",12,65
1psrd32,,He was too busy swearing and freaking out about his boat and the potential damage the collision had caused.,19,66
1psrd32,,"Suddenly we heard a voice cry out again, clearer and more desperate than before,

“Help!",15,67
1psrd32,,"Someone help me!”

We were reminded of why we had come out to this little island. I jumped off the boat, aiming for what I thought was the ground.",29,68
1psrd32,,"I nearly fell back into the water when I landed, but I managed to grab a bundle of tangled branches that were leaning down towards the spot I had jumped.",30,69
1psrd32,,The branches held firm enough to pull myself up the rest of the way and step onto studier ground.,19,70
1psrd32,,"“I need to go look, someone's out there.” I called back to Lewis, not even looking to see if he was going to come ashore as well.",27,71
1psrd32,,"I rushed into a small brush of trees, past more of the strange stones and some strangely carved wooden effigies.",20,72
1psrd32,,I nearly tripped when I stepped into a think pool of mud. I thought it might even be a sinkhole of some kind.,23,73
1psrd32,,"I avoided falling in and rushed further toward the direction I had heard the voice from. Then I saw him. It was a boy, maybe twelve or thirteen years old.",30,74
1psrd32,,"He was standing near a tree with his back to the water, he was covered in mud and it was hard to even make out his features.",27,75
1psrd32,,He was calling for help in between fits of coughing up what looked like gobs of mud. I rushed over to try and help.,24,76
1psrd32,,"As soon as he saw me, he called out again,

“Please help!",12,77
1psrd32,,"It's after me, something pulled me under, its trying to get me.” I rushed over to the kid to check on him.",22,78
1psrd32,,"He was slowly being pulled into another sinkhole, worse than the last one I had passed.",16,79
1psrd32,,His legs were snared by some of the vines growing in the basin and it kept him from being able to climb out of the muddy vortex.,27,80
1psrd32,,"I grabbed his outstretched hands first. “Hold still, Il get you out.” I tried to reassure him while struggling to get him unstuck.",23,81
1psrd32,,"I nearly got pulled in myself, but I was finally able to free his leg and pull him out of the mud pit. He was filthy, but otherwise seemed uninjured.",30,82
1psrd32,,"The shock of the event was causing him to hyperventilate, and I tried to slow him down. I asked him about what happened,

“What happened?",25,83
1psrd32,,"You said something was after you, chased you here? Was it a gator? Is it still nearby?” He tried to answer but his voice was shallow.",26,84
1psrd32,,He had been screaming so hard he had almost lost his voice. I could barely make out his mumbled response.,20,85
1psrd32,,"“No....no gator, something in the mud, something dragged me down, tried to pull me in. I’m not supposed to be here, you aren't either, it's not safe.",27,86
1psrd32,,"There is something bad here, I never would have come if I had known what spot this was.",18,87
1psrd32,,"Something was trapped here long ago, I can't believe this is where I had to get stuck. I got lost, my raft was damaged.",24,88
1psrd32,,"The water here was deeper than I expected, I couldn't get back so I swam up here thinking it was safe.” He was starting to panic again, but I tried to settle him down.",34,89
1psrd32,,"“It's alright, my friend and I will get you home, what was your name?”

He took a deep breath and finally started to control his breathing.",26,90
1psrd32,,"When he sensed the immediate danger was gone he answered,

“Nokoski, my name is Nokoski. But we don’t have time to talk.",22,91
1psrd32,,"We need to leave, do you have a boat?",9,92
1psrd32,,"I lost my raft back that way and I am not getting near the water again, or the mud.” I nodded my head and held out my hand, showing him the way back to the boat.",36,93
1psrd32,,"As we walked I heard Lewis calling out to me and when he saw us walking towards him, he looked relieved and concerned all at once.",26,94
1psrd32,,“What happened to him?” Lewis asked once we were closer.,10,95
1psrd32,,"“I think he got attacked by something, may have been a gator but he was not sure, let's take him back home.",22,96
1psrd32,,Where is home Nokoski?” I asked the boy but his face had turned pale and he stood on the shore looking down at the broken rock that the air boat had knocked down when we had reached land.,38,97
1psrd32,,"He shook his head then froze, standing quiet and still for a long moment before saying something I couldn't understand.",20,98
1psrd32,,"He looked like he was on the verge of shock again and he kept repeating,

“The totem, the totem.” I tried to ask him what was wrong and he turned around and looked at us.",35,99
1psrd32,,He looked completely horrified and I had no idea what had suddenly happened that could make him so scared. “You two need to leave now!,25,100
1psrd32,,"Stay away from me!” Before we could ask why, he dove back into the water despite his previous protests and started swimming as fast as he could away from us and the strange little island we had landed on.",39,101
1psrd32,,"“What the hell was he talking about? I'm so confused.” Lewis said, scratching his head. “I don't know but I think he’s right, something feels off.",26,102
1psrd32,,"He was looking at that little stone that we toppled and kept saying “The totem"" I think we may have accidentally desecrated an important site.",25,103
1psrd32,,Let's get out of here.” Lewis nodded his head and we turned back to the boat and departed.,18,104
1psrd32,,"As we slowly paddled away from the strange island, I thought it was odd when I looked back and saw that the stone in the water was no longer visible.",30,105
1psrd32,,In fact the area behind us seemed to look more like sludge or mud rather than water. I tried the ignore the bad feeling I had focus on getting back.,30,106
1psrd32,,We barely shared a word about the strange event we had witnessed as we slowly floated back. We got back late and I was exhausted.,25,107
1psrd32,,"Lewis offered to let me stay at his place for the night, before heading out to catch my flight back home the next morning. I agreed.",26,108
1psrd32,,"Despite the run-down state of his home, I did not want to try and find a motel at that time of night.",22,109
1psrd32,,I slept on his couch and had a hard time getting comfortable. Lewis had managed to fall asleep almost immediately and I could hear his snoring from where I was.,30,110
1psrd32,,"Just when I did manage to nod off, I thought I heard something outside that made my ears perk. It sort of sounded like wet footprints on the deck outside.",30,111
1psrd32,,I sat up and tried to focus on the odd noise. It shifted slowly and moved on.,17,112
1psrd32,,"I was not sure what it could be, but I was a bit concerned.",14,113
1psrd32,,I considered telling Lewis and asking if animals or other things often ventured near his front deck.,17,114
1psrd32,,"But when the sound finally died down, I managed to get a few fitful hours of sleep before my alarm woke me.",22,115
1psrd32,,I said goodbye to Lewis and promised to try and visit again soon.,13,116
1psrd32,,"As I was leaving back down the road towards where I had parked my car, I saw something odd.",19,117
1psrd32,,"It looked like large muddy footprints on the deck outside his house, they seemed to circle the entire place and even though I did not have time to investigate further, I got a creeping sense of unease when I considered the sound of footsteps last night, and the odd muddy prints I was looking at that morning.",57,118
1psrd32,,I resolved to send a message to Lewis when I got to the airport and tell him what I saw.,20,119
1psrd32,,"I never ended up sending the message though, as I ran into traffic and barely made my flight on time.",20,120
1psrd32,,"When I got off the plane, I was anxious to get back home. Despite the strangeness of the last day, my trip had been a good one.",27,121
1psrd32,,But I was tired and was planning on using my last day before going back to work to relax.,19,122
1psrd32,,"It was two days after my return, when I got the call telling me that Lewis was dead.",18,123
1psrd32,,"I was shocked, I had meant to call him when I got back, but I didn't think it was urgent and now he was dead.",25,124
1psrd32,,I was apparently the last person to have seen him alive and the circumstances of his death were very disturbing.,20,125
1psrd32,,"He seemed to have been drowned in mud, not outside his house near the swamp, but in his own bed. My heart sank and my mind raced.",27,126
1psrd32,,Who would have wanted to kill him?,7,127
1psrd32,,"Then I thought about the muddy footprints, that strange encounter with the boy and how he had said something had tried to pull him into the mud.",27,128
1psrd32,,"Worst of all I considered how he had turned pale when he saw the small rock totem we had toppled, when we arrived to try and help.",27,129
1psrd32,,He had tried to warn us away from something bad but left without giving us more details.,17,130
1psrd32,,I told the police everything that happened that day and I was informed of their intent to keep me as a person of interest for the investigation into his death.,30,131
1psrd32,,"When I hung up the phone I was crushed, confused and scared.",12,132
1psrd32,,"I had no idea what had really happened to him, but whatever it was, felt like it was connected to what we had seen.",24,133
1psrd32,,"I felt a lingering sense of danger as well. I felt terrible for what happened to Lewis, but I was glad to be far away from where it had happened.",30,134
1psrd32,,The next day was when I saw the footsteps at home for the first time. I was just getting back home from work.,23,135
1psrd32,,"It was a dry day, no rain or snow, despite how wet the winter had been so far.",18,136
1psrd32,,It made the presence of those muddy prints even more jarring when I saw them.,15,137
1psrd32,,A line of the tracks could be traced from the woods near the backyard all the way to my front door.,21,138
1psrd32,,Unnerved by the sight I bent down to inspect them. I was disturbed when I saw they looked exactly like the ones I had seen outside Lewis’s house that night.,30,139
1psrd32,,"Despite the large humanoid shape, no boot imprint or anything like that was present.",14,140
1psrd32,,"There was not even the outline of a barefoot, just a large general shape and it looked about ten sizes too large to be a normal human print.",28,141
1psrd32,,I followed the tracks to my front door and saw an even larger concentration of mud outside.,17,142
1psrd32,,"My doormat was saturated, and I saw mud on my door handle as well.",14,143
1psrd32,,Seeing this after Lewis had just been killed and learning about the detail in which it had happened cause me to fly into a panic.,25,144
1psrd32,,"I did not see anyone, or anything around, but I rushed to unlock my door.",15,145
1psrd32,,"I hurried inside and slammed it behind me, locking it again the moment I was inside.",16,146
1psrd32,,I turned on the lights and frantically searched for any trace of mud in the house. I was relieved when none was evident.,23,147
1psrd32,,"At least in that moment, I relaxed and felt a bit safer.",12,148
1psrd32,,"I kept thinking about the mud, the boy calling for help and the horror in which he had fled after he told us to run.",25,149
1psrd32,,"Then I thought about Lewis, he had been drowned in mud.",11,150
1psrd32,,"It couldn't have been an accident, something from the swamp had gotten in and killed him, smothered him with mud.",20,151
1psrd32,,I looked outside through my front door and knew then that whatever had killed Lewis had followed me back home somehow.,21,152
1psrd32,,"We must have done something when we were on that island, violated the sanctity of somethings home perhaps? I remembered the boy's words about a totem.",26,153
1psrd32,,Had we broken a sacred object? What was it doing there? And how did this thing know who we were and how to find us?,25,154
1psrd32,,"I had many questions and few answers. The one thing I did know, was that my time was running out.",20,155
1psrd32,,"I didn't leave my house for the rest of the night and when I tried to sleep, I swear I heard dull scratching on the windows outside and the slow shambling walk of something dragging muddy feet along the perimeter of my house.",43,156
1psrd32,,Yesterday I stayed inside.,4,157
1psrd32,,"I didn’t know what else to do, I knew I was in trouble, but I couldn't tell the police that some mud monster followed me home from Florida and was stalking me.",32,158
1psrd32,,I calmed down a bit during the afternoon and even risked ordering food for lunch.,15,159
1psrd32,,"When nothing had shown up and jumped out at me when I got my food, I relaxed a bit.",19,160
1psrd32,,I felt safer knowing that at least in the day I was safe. That feeling did not last through the night.,21,161
1psrd32,,"When it started to get dark, the subtle fear crept back into my mind.",14,162
1psrd32,,"I decided to distract myself with a shower, since I realized I had not had one for a few days.",20,163
1psrd32,,"I turned on the water and was puzzled when nothing came out. As I waited, all I heard was a low grumbling in the pipes.",25,164
1psrd32,,I sighed when I thought I might have to call a plumber.,12,165
1psrd32,,"I wish it had just been the pipes, since in the next moment something did come out of the showerhead; it just wasn't water.",24,166
1psrd32,,There was a large bulbous mass of mud and viscous dirt pressing through the showerhead along with a trickle of the water trying to move through the mass.,28,167

I was in a small, windowless room, a concrete bunker beneath the cabin. All the while, the thumping was louder than ever before.",26,0

1psr7yx,,"Mason jars, hundreds of them, all filled with a murky, amber-colored liquid. Suspended in the liquid were... things. Things that had once been living, things that were now grotesquely preserved.",30,2
1psr7yx,,"A snake, coiled in eternal agony. A bird, its wings frozen in a death-throe. A cluster of misshapen, tumorous-looking organs that I couldn't identify.",24,3
1psr7yx,,"There were charts on the walls, complex diagrams of what looked like circulatory systems, annotated with a cramped, precise scrawl that I recognized as my grandfather's.",26,4
1psr7yx,,"There were medical textbooks, their pages yellowed and brittle, their spines cracked. It was a charnel house, a cabinet of horrors created by a madman. My grandfather.",27,5
1psr7yx,,"Finally, I looked to the center of the room, its oppressive aura beating down on me.",16,6
1psr7yx,,"In the dead center, surrounded by the shelves of bottled abominations, was the source of the thumping. It was a machine.",21,7
1psr7yx,,"was a monstrosity of jury-rigged genius and utter, unfathomable madness. A large, corroded tank, the size of a small hot water heater, sat on a raised platform.",27,8
1psr7yx,,"A thick, industrial-grade hose, the color of faded rubber, snaked from the tank to a series of smaller, glass tubes, which in turn were connected to a complicated-looking apparatus of brass valves, pressure gauges, and a humming motor.",38,9
1psr7yx,,"The whole thing looked like a bastard hybrid of a moonshine still, a dialysis machine, and something from a Frankenstein movie. And the thumping...",24,10
1psr7yx,,"the thumping was the sound of the pump, a massive, cast-iron beast of a thing that was clearly the heart of this mechanical abomination.",24,11
1psr7yx,,"It was a well pump, I realized with a jolt of icy horror, a heavy-duty, industrial pump that had been modified, repurposed for some unspeakable task.",26,12
1psr7yx,,But that wasn't the worst of it. The worst of it was the chair.,14,13
1psr7yx,,"It was an old, leather-bound armchair, the kind you'd see in a doctor's waiting room, but it had been stripped of its upholstery, leaving only the stained, cracked wood and a frame of cold, unforgiving metal.",36,14
1psr7yx,,"And in that chair, strapped to it with a series of thick leather restraints, was a man. Or what was left of a man.",24,15
1psr7yx,,"He was emaciated, a desiccated husk of a human being, a cadaver that had somehow forgotten to lie down.",19,16
1psr7yx,,"His shrunken head lolled to one side, with deep aged lines that looked like spidery crevices weaving throughout his false flesh, the head of ancient deity.",26,17
1psr7yx,,"His skin was a sickly, jaundiced yellow, stretched taut over a skeletal frame.",13,18
1psr7yx,,"His hair was a wispy, cloud-white halo around his skull-like face, and his eyes were sunken deep into their sockets, two dark, vacant pits in a mask of withered flesh.",30,19
1psr7yx,,"A thick, clear tube ran from the apparatus, its needle buried deep in the crook of his arm, a steady, sickly-looking fluid—a mix of the amber liquid from the jars and something that looked ominously like fresh blood—trickling through it, feeding the pump.",43,20
1psr7yx,,"The thump-thump wasn't just the pump; it was the pump forcing this vile concoction through the man's veins, a mechanical heartbeat keeping a corpse in a state of perpetual, agonizing animation.",31,21
1psr7yx,,"But my eyes were drawn to the tapping. The frantic, desperate tapping had stopped, but I could still see the instrument of its creation.",24,22
1psr7yx,,"It was the twitch of his hand, animated in a state of wicked purgatory, echoing like an ancient typewriter against the metal arm of the chair, infinitely louder than the motion would suggest, a pathetic, robotic plea for an end that would not, could not, come.",46,23
1psr7yx,,"My mind, already frayed beyond recognition, finally snapped. In its place, something primal and screaming took over.",17,24
1psr7yx,,"I was no longer a man named Benjamin, a recent inheritor of a mountain cabin.",15,25
1psr7yx,,"I was a witness to a blasphemy against nature, a voyeur at the theater of the damned.",17,26
1psr7yx,,"I tried to scream, but my throat was a constricted knot of silent agony.",14,27
1psr7yx,,"I stumbled backward, my feet tangling in the snaking hoses of the apparatus, and I fell, my back hitting the cold, hard concrete with a sickening thud.",27,28
1psr7yx,,"The flashlight slipped from my grasp, rolling away, its beam now casting a wild, strobing light on the walls of horrors, the jars of preserved nightmares dancing in the chaotic glow.",31,29
1psr7yx,,"I lay there, sprawled on the floor, my body paralyzed by a terror so profound it was its own form of sensory input, a physical presence in the room.",29,30
1psr7yx,,I couldn't breathe. I couldn't think.,6,31
1psr7yx,,"I could only stare, my gaze locked on the wretched figure in the chair, on the rhythmic convulsions of the pump, on the horrifying, undeniable truth of my own heritage.",30,32
1psr7yx,,My grandfather hadn't been a spiritualist or a simple folk doctor.,11,33

1psr7yx,,"The pump continued its relentless, rhythmic work, but in the absence of the frantic tapping, its sound seemed less a heartbeat and more a function, a cold, mechanical process devoid of any life.",33,37
1psr7yx,,I picked up my flashlight reluctantly and pointed it back at the figure.,13,38
1psr7yx,,"A strange, vague familial resemblance, though distorted by age, atrophy, and whatever dark arts had been wrought upon him, was undeniable. The nose. The high, intelligent forehead.",27,39
1psr7yx,,"The shape of the jaw. It was like looking into a funhouse mirror, a grotesque reflection of the face I saw in my own shaving mirror every morning.",28,40
1psr7yx,,"A cold, creeping dread, far more potent than the fear I had been feeling, began to seep into my bones. This was a family affair. A generational curse.",28,41

1psr7yx,,"The man, whose name I didn't even know, was a prisoner in a state of perpetual non-life, a living sacrifice to some dark, forgotten power. And I...",27,46

1psr7yx,,"His chest was barely moving. It was shallow and fluttering, a rise and fall that was almost imperceptible. An odd, inhuman lagging that barely resembled breathing.",26,48
1psr7yx,,"His eyes were closed, his eyelids thin, veined membranes. A prisoner in a state of perpetual, agonizing non-life. A living cadaver.",21,49
1psr7yx,,"The tapping had stopped, the frantic cry for help silenced.",10,50
1psr7yx,,"But as I watched, a single, tear-like drop of a clear, yellowish fluid welled up from the corner of his eye and traced a slow, glistening path down the sunken crater of his cheek.",34,51
1psr7yx,,"This was the old root. The one who was holding. The ""graft"" wasn't a medical procedure to cure an ailment.",20,52
1psr7yx,,"It was a transfer of something vital, something that sustained one life at the expense of another.",17,53
1psr7yx,,"I, reeling from the sheer, unadulterated horror of it all, latched onto the details, the minutiae of this chamber of horrors, as if by understanding the components, I could somehow understand the whole.",33,54
1psr7yx,,"I looked closer at the apparatus, the jury-rigged monstrosity that was the source of the thump-thump. The tank was not just a simple container.",24,55
1psr7yx,,"It was a distillery, a monstrous alembic designed to extract some vital essence. The amber liquid wasn't just preservative.",19,56
1psr7yx,,"It was a medium, a carrier for whatever my grandfather had managed to distill from... what? From the land? From some sacrifice? From another poor soul?",26,57
1psr7yx,,"I shone my flashlight on the shelves of jars, my mind racing, connecting the dots in a pattern of pure, unadulterated madness. The preserved animals, the misshapen organs...",28,58
1psr7yx,,"they weren't just trophies. They were experiments. Failed experiments, perhaps, or stepping stones on the path to this final, abominable success. I had to know more.",26,59
1psr7yx,,"I had to understand the full scope of my grandfather's depravity. My eyes scanned the room, my flashlight beam a nervous, searching finger in the oppressive dark.",27,60
1psr7yx,,"I saw a small, wooden desk tucked away in the corner, almost hidden in the shadow of a towering shelf of bottled nightmares.",23,61
1psr7yx,,"On it, amidst a clutter of stained glassware, scalpels, and a pile of yellowed papers, was a small, portable tape recorder.",21,62
1psr7yx,,"An old model, a gray plastic box with a built-in microphone and a row of chunky buttons. It looked so out of place, so mundane, amidst the surrounding barbarity.",29,63
1psr7yx,,"But it was a clue. A message. My hand trembled as I reached for it, my fingers fumbling with the cold, smooth plastic.",23,64
1psr7yx,,"I picked it up, my breath held tight in my chest. There was a cassette tape inside, its spools showing it had already been rewound to the start.",28,65
1psr7yx,,"The tape clicked into place, and I pressed the 'play' button. A low, humming static filled the room for a moment, a sound that was almost comforting in its familiarity.",30,66
1psr7yx,,"Then, a voice. It was my grandfather's. I recognized it instantly, even though it was thinner, weaker, frayed by age and whatever illness had eventually claimed him.",27,67
1psr7yx,,"But the cadence, the precise, almost academic tone, was unmistakable. ""If you're hearing this, Benjamin... then you've found him. You've found the old root.",24,68
1psr7yx,,"And you've found your inheritance.""

My blood ran cold. This was a message, a post-mortem confession, a final, twisted act of paternal guidance. ""I know what you must be thinking.",30,69
1psr7yx,,I know the questions you have. The answers... the answers are complex.,12,70
1psr7yx,,"They are rooted in the old ways, in the traditions of this mountain, in a truth that the world outside has long forgotten. The mountain rot. The wasting sickness.",29,71
1psr7yx,,"It's not just a disease. It's a tax, a tithe that the land demands from those who live on it.",20,72
1psr7yx,,"A levy of life.""

His voice was calm, reasoned, as if he were explaining a complex scientific theorem, not justifying an act of unspeakable cruelty.",25,73
1psr7yx,,"""Our family, Benjamin, our family has always defied it. For generations, we have thrived on this land, while others withered and died. We were healthy, we were prosperous, we were...",30,74
1psr7yx,,blessed. But the blessing came at a cost. It required a graft. A transference of life.,16,75
1psr7yx,,"A way to pay the tithe without sacrificing our own.""

My grandfather paused, and in the silence, the only sound was the relentless thump-thump of the pump.",27,76
1psr7yx,,"I looked from the tape recorder to the desiccated figure in the chair, the ""old root,"" the source of my family's twisted prosperity. ""I tried to find another way.",29,77
1psr7yx,,"I did. I spent decades studying, experimenting, delving into the forgotten pharmacopeias, the rituals of the old ones.",18,78
1psr7yx,,"I tried to cheat the mountain, to find a loophole in its ancient contract. But there are no loopholes.",19,79
1psr7yx,,"There is only the debt.""

His voice grew weaker, a faint, rattling cough echoing from the speaker. ""The wasting sickness... it found me. It's a slow, insidious thing, Benjamin.",29,80
1psr7yx,,"It starts in the bones, a deep, aching cold that no fire can warm. Then it moves to the blood, a thickening, a slowing.",24,81
1psr7yx,,"The organs begin to fail, one by one, like a failing battery. There is no cure. Not in the modern world. And not in the old world.",27,82
1psr7yx,,"There is only the graft.""

I was mesmerized, my mind a whirlwind of horror and disbelief.",16,83
1psr7yx,,"The story he was telling, this insane, folkloric justification for the atrocity before me, was starting to make a terrifying kind of sense. The fertile land. The family's wealth.",29,84
1psr7yx,,"The ""mountain rot."" It was all connected. ""My father... your great-grandfather... he is the old root. He was strong, a powerful man, full of the mountain's vitality.",27,85
1psr7yx,,"He was the last vestige of this damned lineage, selfishly having me and polluting a thousand generations after. But he had a failing heart. A weakness.",26,86
1psr7yx,,"A chink in his armor. It was an opportunity. A chance to... rewire the system. I did what had to be done, Benjamin. I grafted the sickness onto him.",29,87
1psr7yx,,I took the rot from my own blood and forced it into his. I didn't cure myself. I... transferred the debt. I made him the tithe.,26,88
1psr7yx,,"He became the anchor, the sacrifice that kept the rest of us safe, that kept the land fertile, that kept the rot at bay.""

The tape went silent for a long, agonizing moment.",33,89
1psr7yx,,"The only sound in the room was the relentless, soul-crushing thumping of the pump.",14,90
1psr7yx,,"I stared at the withered figure in the chair, my great-grandfather, and for the first time, I saw him not just as a victim, but as a cornerstone of a monstrous, cyclical horror.",33,91
1psr7yx,,"He was the foundation upon which my family's prosperity and damnation was built, a living tombstone marking the price of their survival.",22,92
1psr7yx,,"My grandfather's voice returned, now barely a whisper, a dry, papery rustle from the speaker. ""It worked. For forty years, it worked. The land has been good to us.",29,93
1psr7yx,,"We have been healthy. We have been... exempt. But the machine, the apparatus... it requires maintenance. The graft requires a... a steward. A caretaker to tend the old root.",29,94
1psr7yx,,"And my own sickness, the one I thought I had outrun, has returned. A different strain, perhaps. A final consequence. I am dying, Benjamin.",24,95
1psr7yx,,I can no longer maintain the connection.,7,96
1psr7yx,,"The root is weakening."" 

Out of the corner of my eye, I could have sworn a sudden jerk of movement came from my great-grandfather's chair.",25,97
1psr7yx,,"But when my eyes fully found him, he was perfectly, impossibly motionless—a waxwork figure draped in a dead man's suit. My grandpa continued.",23,98
1psr7yx,,"""I left the cabin to you because you are the last. You are the eldest son of the eldest son. You are the only one who can inherit the debt.",30,99
1psr7yx,,"You are the only one with the blood-link that can sustain the graft. The inheritance wasn't a gift, Benjamin.",19,100
1psr7yx,,"It was a summons."" 

My stomach turned, a cold, churning sickness that had nothing to do with the frigid air of the bunker. I wasn't just an heir.",28,101
1psr7yx,,"I was a replacement. A new cog in this diabolical machine. ""I know this is a terrible burden.",18,102
1psr7yx,,I know it is a horror that no sane man should be asked to bear. But you have no choice. The mountain will not be denied.,26,103
1psr7yx,,"The debt must be paid. And if the old root fails, if the pump stops...",15,104
1psr7yx,,"the mountain rot will return with a vengeance.""

He paused, and I could hear him breathing, a ragged, wet sound that spoke of failing lungs and a body consumed from within.",31,105
1psr7yx,,"""This is something I have only recently begun to understand. The connection is deeper than I ever imagined.",18,106
1psr7yx,,The link between the root and the heir is not just a matter of land and legacy. It is a... a symbiosis.,22,107

1psr7yx,,"The apparatus, the distillation, the graft... it has created a feedback loop.",12,109
1psr7yx,,"His life force is being siphoned, filtered through the land, and fed back to you, to the last scion of this cursed bloodline.",23,110
1psr7yx,,"He is the source, and you are the destination."" 

My mind reeled, a spattering of pure, unadulterated terror. This wasn't just about avoiding a horrible disease. This was about... survival.",30,111
1psr7yx,,"A grotesque, parasitic survival. ""If the pump stops, Benjamin... if his heart stops... your own will follow.",17,112
1psr7yx,,"It will start to wilt away until you are a man no longer, a bastardized being controlled by the will of the mountain. This is my final, terrible discovery.",29,113
1psr7yx,,"The inheritance, the cabin, the land... it's not a trap. It's an anchor. His anchor, and yours.",17,114
1psr7yx,,"You are a hostage to your own blood, a prisoner in a game you never agreed to play. You cannot leave. You cannot let him die.",26,115
1psr7yx,,"Because if he does, you will die with him. It will claim you, Benjamin. I have seen what it does. It is not a peaceful death.",26,116
1psr7yx,,"It is a slow, agonizing dissolution, a melting away of the self until there is nothing left but a husk, a hollow shell for the mountain's hunger.",27,117
1psr7yx,,"I would not wish that on my worst enemy. And I certainly would not wish it on my own flesh and blood.""

He paused for a moment.",27,118
1psr7yx,,"The longest moment I have ever felt. I could hear him breathing again, gurgle through the speakers.",17,119

1psqqje,LA Airbnb left me scared for months,"I read a lot of these, and thank you all for sharing your stories. I thought maybe I should share one I have. This was back in June 2019.",29,0
1psqqje,,"I (19F at the time) went to visit my best friend, we'll call her Kelly, at her college UCSC.",19,1
1psqqje,,"A few of our hometown friends tagged along, and we stayed at her apartment for a day until our bigger trip down to LA.",24,2
1psqqje,,"Us and her college friends rented a minivan and drove 6 hours down to West Hollywood. There were 7 total of us girls, and it was all going really well.",30,3
1psqqje,,"Going to Malibu Beach, breakfast at the Belvedere Hotel, hiking to the Hollywood sign. Our first 2 nights were joyful, as well as our last until late in the night.",30,4
1psqqje,,"Before I go on, I'd like to give some description to the Airbnb.",13,5
1psqqje,,"It was in a sketchy area, there was a shed (we weren't supposed to go in) in the backyard among overgrown plants, there was a high chainlink fencing surrounding the property, and you had to enter a padlock code at the driveway to get the key.",46,6
1psqqje,,"It was one story, 3 bedrooms. There was a glass window front porch and that's where we'd hang out a lot and smoke weed (lol).",25,7
1psqqje,,"The back porch was similar, but more beaten down. We kept both doors locked at all times and the driveway gate as well.",23,8
1psqqje,,"I have the exact address (found it by street view on google maps), but I won't release that now.",19,9
1psqqje,,"Our last night, Saturday, we were hanging out on the front porch.",12,10
1psqqje,,"What was so weird and a foreshadow we didn't see, is that while on the porch, we heard the padlock and chain jingling around down at the gate.",28,11
1psqqje,,"There was all brush, so we couldn't see, but I remember we all retreated inside for a little bit, until we worked up the courage to go back out and finish the joint.",33,12
1psqqje,,A bunch of us went to bed early figuring we had to be up early to drive back to SC. Some of them still needed to study for finals.,29,13
1psqqje,,"I remember smoking and then heading to bed around 11:30PM. My other friend, we'll call her Gabby, was the last to go to bed around 1:30AM.",26,14
1psqqje,,"Except for Kelly, she stayed awake talking to her crush on FaceTime.",12,15
1psqqje,,"I was sleeping for a while, until I was woken up by one of the girls in a frantic state.",20,16
1psqqje,,"She was pleading with me to come out to the living room, that they think there is ""something"" in the house.",21,17
1psqqje,,"I was honestly pissed at first, that they couldn't figure it out themselves and that they woke me up. I didn't know yet the desperation of the situation.",28,18
1psqqje,,"I walked out into the living room and everyone was there except one other, who was sleeping.",17,19
1psqqje,,"From the living room, you can't see the kitchen and that's also where the bathroom is.",16,20
1psqqje,,"I sat on the couch and they all, simultaneously, were trying to tell me what was going on in whispers.",20,21
1psqqje,,"Again, I was annoyed, so I said, ""If you really think there's something going on, why don't you call the cops!!?"" and then all of them told me to SHHH and I shut up.",34,22
1psqqje,,It was for 5 seconds that I was quiet. And I heard movement in the kitchen. Almost like putting something in the sink or moving cups around?,27,23
1psqqje,,"My heart dropped and I jumped off that couch so fast, in a manner I will never forget.",18,24
1psqqje,,"I gathered all of the girls into one bedroom, went to wake up the last (she was so annoyed at me waking her up, I had to be a bit mean to get her the fuck up), and we took safety to the other bedroom.",45,25
1psqqje,,"We put a chair under the door, me and another girl stood by it just listening and guarding.",18,26
1psqqje,,"At this point we're a mix of fear pacing, crying, not being able to breathe, and going nonverbal. I was trembling. Kelly was on the phone with the cops.",29,27
1psqqje,,Me and the other door guarder were talking about what happened. She said Kelly was still on FaceTime and started hearing things going on in the bathroom.,27,28
1psqqje,,Like drawers opening and our cosmetics being moved around. This was around 3:00AM.,13,29
1psqqje,,"Kelly didn't remember me going to bed, and thought it was me, so she called out my name twice.",19,30
1psqqje,,"This woke Gabby up, and Gabby came out asking what was going on. This caused the other girls to come out and check it out.",25,31
1psqqje,,I remember one of the girls told me she heard spoons rattling and her voice was shaking.,17,32
1psqqje,,"They thought it could be an animal, so they went by the open kitchen doorway and banged a water bottle against the frame and yelled, to scare it off.",29,33
1psqqje,,"But obviously, that did nothing. That's when they came and woke me. At this point, the cops are taking long of course and all girls are feeling different, wild emotions.",30,34
1psqqje,,There was a huge window in the bedroom and I just remember feeling so terrified that they'd climb in through there.,21,35
1psqqje,,"The other door guard looked at me and whispered, ""Wait, put your ear and listen,"". I heard footsteps. I wanted to scream, cry, throw up.",25,36
1psqqje,,"I whispered that we weren't going to share this at that particular moment. The cops come, but they are not allowed to enter without us letting them in.",28,37
1psqqje,,This causes another huge problem and Kelly is fighting with the dispatcher on the phone.,15,38
1psqqje,,"I'm asking if they could just come to the window, that we don't want to go out there.",18,39
1psqqje,,"Eventually, the other door guard gains the courage and goes out to let the cops in. Welp.",17,40
1psqqje,,"I have had many experiences with cops, I live on a bad block, and this one I will remember. They were two females, you'd think they understand our fear.",29,41
1psqqje,,"Not in the slightest. They said they ""searched the home and saw nothing"". They didn't ask questions, they weren't curious, they just wanted to leave.",25,42
1psqqje,,They kept glancing to the weed on the table! As if inferring it was all because we were high!,19,43
1psqqje,,"Mind you, some of us weren't smokers and those of us who were, it was at 11PM! Weed has never affected me nor anyone I know like *this* before.",29,44
1psqqje,,"We ask them if they searched the backyard, that there was a run down shed back there, and they were hesitant to do that for us.",26,45
1psqqje,,YALL DIDN'T SEARCH THAT IN THE FIRST PLACE? They leave.,10,46
1psqqje,,"And Kelly looks at us and goes, ""I don't know about y'all, but there is no way I am sleeping here tonight and I want to leave right now,"" and we all immediately agreed.",34,47
1psqqje,,It was probably around 4:00AM at this point. We pack up our stuff and leave for a 6 hour drive to SC.,22,48
1psqqje,,"During the drive, the sun rises, I text my parents, and Kelly is messaging the Airbnb host.",17,49
1psqqje,,"When the host woke up, she was never helpful, and I honestly don't know much development on that. We were in CA for 2 more days.",26,50
1psqqje,,"I remember Gabby and I just hung out at the beach while the girls studied and took their finals, but it all felt so weird.",25,51
1psqqje,,"It was the only thing we could *think* about, *talk* about.",11,52
1psqqje,,"At one point, Kelly broke down crying because she was holding her strength for so long, trying to be the dominant one.",22,53
1psqqje,,It was so sad to watch and we all just group hugged her. It didn't feel real and our brains were just trying to come up with an explanation.,29,54
1psqqje,,"Trying to piece it all together and make sense of it. On the long ride back to SC, one of the girls was saying maybe it was something supernatural?",29,55
1psqqje,,"That seems like such a far reach, regardless of how big a fan of ghosts I am.",17,56
1psqqje,,The most sensible explanation is that a homeless person broke in and enjoyed going through girls' belongings. Our noises and yells didn't scare them off because they were probably high.,30,57
1psqqje,,"So often, I think, what if we just went into the kitchen? But if there was someone there, what the fuck would we have done?",25,58
1psqqje,,And then what if it was nothing? Just empty space? This event took up my life for a while.,19,59
1psqqje,,I was so strict on all of the windows and doors being locked at night back at home. Checking 3 times.,21,60
1psqqje,,"I was pleading with my dad to get a new, updated alarm system. I put a bat under my bed.",20,61
1psqqje,,"Honestly, all of the stuff we, sadly, should already be doing. But that fear, the inability to fall asleep for months, I don't want that ever again.",27,62
1psqqje,,Thank you for reading.,4,63
1psqqje,,"I don't know who or what was in that house, but this experience caused me to buy and always bring my portable door lock to Airbnbs with me.",28,64
1psp7ch,I set up a camera in my room. What I saw still haunts me.,"“She’s in my dreams again,” my wife gasped, stirring me awake. It was 3 am.",15,0
1psp7ch,,"For the past few weeks, my wife had been having the same nightmare: a pale woman would appear next to our bed and pull off the sheets.",27,1
1psp7ch,,"She’d point to our bodies and wave her index finger back and forth, whispering, “Eeny, meeny, miny, moe.”

I thought the dream was odd, but not out of bounds for a woman who binged horror movies, so I’d usually roll over, pull the blanket over my shoulder, and tell her to go back to sleep.",55,2
1psp7ch,,But this morning seemed different. There was something exact and final about her voice. It encouraged me to get up and see what was wrong.,25,3
1psp7ch,,"“What is it?!” I rubbed the sleep from my eyes. My wife stood at her side of the bed, wearing a horrified expression.",23,4
1psp7ch,,"“Sweetie, what?”

She just pointed at the floor.",8,5
1psp7ch,,"I got up, switched on the light, and made my way over until I came face to face with the area she had pointed to.",25,6
1psp7ch,,"There at her feet was a pile of human hair. *What on earth?!*

I did a double take.",18,7
1psp7ch,,"The hair on the left side of her head was missing, like someone had snipped it off with scissors. “It happened while I was asleep,” she muttered.",27,8
1psp7ch,,I called the police. Drove us to her parents’ place. The thought that someone had broken into our home and harassed us made it impossible to sleep.,27,9
1psp7ch,,"“I think it’s connected to my dreams,” my wife said. “No way. It’s not real. It’s just a nightmare.”

The police didn’t know what had happened.",26,10
1psp7ch,,I figured some psycho had broken into our home and given my wife a late-night haircut. The frustrating thing was that there were no signs of a break-in.,28,11
1psp7ch,,"The only clue was the discarded remains of my wife’s hair, but that didn’t give the investigators any leads.",19,12
1psp7ch,,My wife later evened out the rest of her hair by removing the shoulder-length strands on the right side of her head.,22,13
1psp7ch,,Now she had a shorter cut that ended at the middle of her neck. She was still beautiful. Just… different.,20,14
1psp7ch,,"After the police reassured us that our house was safe, we returned and asked our “spiritual” friend to come and give it a once-over.",24,15
1psp7ch,,"“I think it’s something spiritual,” she mused. “Sometimes evil entities cross over and cause panic.”

“You’re saying a demon cut my wife’s hair?”

“Maybe.",24,16
1psp7ch,,"I’ve heard stories about sprites tormenting beautiful women.""

I was unconvinced but willing to accept anything, so I asked, “How do we get rid of it?”

“Try this.” She pulled out a small vial from her jacket.",37,17
1psp7ch,,“Anointing oil.,2,18
1psp7ch,,"Sprinkle it on the doors and walls and any evil beings will be scared off.”

I dabbed a few drops on our front and back doors and outside walls.",29,19
1psp7ch,,"I felt stupid doing so, but I didn’t have any explanations for what had happened.",15,20
1psp7ch,,"I figured, *What do I have to lose?*

After our friend left, I put a camera in our bedroom.",19,21
1psp7ch,,"I assured my wife, “If anything turns up, we’ll catch it on film.”

***

What happened next is almost too difficult to believe. I’ll try to explain.",27,22
1psp7ch,,"If I hadn’t seen it on camera, I wouldn’t have believed it myself. The strange experience started after we had fallen asleep at our usual time of 10 pm.",29,23
1psp7ch,,"A few hours later, my wife shook me awake: “Honey, I had that nightmare again!”

I felt anxiety prick at me. Our hair incident was only a few months prior.",30,24
1psp7ch,,"I clicked on the lamp and motioned to her, “I’ll stay up and keep an eye out.",17,25
1psp7ch,,"You relax and get some sleep.”

My wife laid back down and drifted off. I still wasn’t convinced if this was spiritual or not. Dreams aren’t real, right?",28,26
1psp7ch,,They can't invade daily life. They’re just processes of our imagination. I wondered if my wife had sleepwalked and cut off her own hair.,24,27
1psp7ch,,"I’d heard about people doing surreal things like that. Regardless, I must've fallen asleep because I awoke to my wife's screaming. I staggered out of bed, in shock.",28,28
1psp7ch,,"“Helen?!”

I turned the corner and found her in the bathroom, hyperventilating in front of the mirror: “Oh god!",19,29
1psp7ch,,"It happened again.”

I glanced up and noticed…

… her left eyebrow was missing. “Something was hovering over me…” she groaned, tears streaming down her face.",26,30
1psp7ch,,“And then… a sharp scraping against my skin.,8,31
1psp7ch,,"I can’t stay in this house any longer!”

She sprinted past me, snatched her keys from the glass bowl in our living room, and dashed outside.",26,32
1psp7ch,,"I was too stunned to even react. I listened to the sound of her car drive further away. *She’s going to her parents’ house,* I figured.",26,33
1psp7ch,,I steeled my resolve and remained inside. Determined to find the source of this mischief. I yanked a knife from the kitchen. Did an extensive tour of the home.,29,34
1psp7ch,,"Just like last time, there wasn’t a single sign of a break-in. ***

I called the police. Told them everything.",20,35
1psp7ch,,Mentioned how my wife was gone and that I was staying behind to find out who had invaded our home.,20,36
1psp7ch,,I informed them that I had a camera and was eager to hand over the footage to assist in their investigation.,21,37
1psp7ch,,"But before they arrived, I wanted to see the footage myself. Check if something… or someone… had really snuck in and tormented us. I opened the app on my computer.",30,38
1psp7ch,,Fast-forwarded to the precise moment where my wife had stirred me awake. There I was… exhausted… trying to reassure her.,20,39
1psp7ch,,I skipped ahead to where I had switched on the lamp and escorted her back to bed.,17,40
1psp7ch,,"Then, I watched myself stay awake for a few moments, then fall back asleep. I sped on further until I saw…

… the woman.",24,41
1psp7ch,,"She had appeared out of nowhere, lurking in the corner of our room.",13,42
1psp7ch,,"Even with my added lamp light, she seemed fuzzy, like the camera didn't want to focus on her. Where she had come in from I couldn’t tell.",27,43
1psp7ch,,But at exactly 2:23 am she had drifted to the foot of our bed. She was about five-foot-three and her body was of average build.,25,44
1psp7ch,,"She wore loose pajamas and had stringy hair covering her face. Just like in my wife’s dream, she pulled off our sheets and examined our bodies.",26,45
1psp7ch,,"Like a studying physician, she placed a thumb on her chin and moved an index finger back and forth, *Eeny, meeny, miny, moe.*

I was so grossed out that I couldn’t watch it any longer.",35,46
1psp7ch,,"I leapt from my seat, vomited on the floor. The thought of someone being in our home, watching us, was too much.",22,47
1psp7ch,,It horrified me beyond belief and made me never want to sleep again.,13,48
1psp7ch,,"But instead of giving in to the panic, I went back to my computer and rewound the clip several seconds.",20,49
1psp7ch,,I’d theorized that the woman had somehow climbed in through our window and snuck back out.,16,50
1psp7ch,,"However, when I searched for the exact moment of her entry, I was surprised to see…

… no signs of her breaking in.",23,51
1psp7ch,,The woman had simply appeared in the room’s corner… like a wraith emerging from her tomb. *It’s a harassing spirit.* My friend’s words echoed in my mind.,27,52
1psp7ch,,"But that would mean that this trespasser wasn’t real. She was an evil entity sent to harass my wife and me. But that wasn’t possible, right?",26,53
1psp7ch,,"“No,” I said to myself. “It has to be an actual person. This woman has to be real.”

And then I heard it.",23,54
1psp7ch,,"*Thump-thump-thump.*

An intense knocking from my bedroom closet. It was a loud series of bumps that sounded like someone was trying to break out.",24,55
1psp7ch,,"*Thump-thump-thump.*

The noises sent an electrical charge through my body. The skin on my neck pimpled. *Oh Jesus.* I glanced around for my phone.",24,56
1psp7ch,,"*Where are the police?*

I searched for my device, remembered, *I left it in the living room!*

I rose slowly and kept an eye on the closet as I ventured toward the hallway.",33,57
1psp7ch,,"*Thump-thump-thump.*

The only comfort I felt was knowing that the police were on their way.",15,58
1psp7ch,,"I had told them, “There’s someone in my house!” They’d assured me they'd be there in minutes. I just needed to make it outside. Then I’d be safe.",28,59
1psp7ch,,I rushed into the hall. The thumping from my closet growing louder.,12,60
1psp7ch,,"I reached the living room, scooped up my phone from the couch, and dipped my hand in the glass bowl by the front door.",24,61
1psp7ch,,"My fingers fished for my keys and wallet, found nothing.",10,62
1psp7ch,,"*Did my wife take my things as well?!*

“Eeny, meeny, miny, moe.”

The voice was soft and playful, like a child learning a nursery rhyme.",25,63
1psp7ch,,"But it was also detached, like a person who didn’t quite understand the meaning of their words.",17,64
1psp7ch,,"I stepped back and swallowed every ounce of fear and turned, seeing…

… the woman from my wife’s nightmares. Skin so grey it resembled concrete.",25,65
1psp7ch,,Her hair as dark as rotten leaves.,7,66
1psp7ch,,"And her eyes were the color of frozen fat, like the kind you see in a bowl of soup after leaving it in the fridge overnight.",26,67
1psp7ch,,"In one hand she held my keys and wallet. In the other, she grasped a rusty straight razor. “Catch a tiger by the toe…” She grinned.",26,68
1psp7ch,,"“Eeny, meeny, miny, moe!”

The woman dropped my things and leapt at me, moving with incredible speed. *Oh God! Help me!*

I jumped back, petrified.",25,69
1psp7ch,,"Somehow, I managed to get my hand on the door and wrenched it open.",14,70
1psp7ch,,"Out of the corner of my eye, I saw the gleam of her razor’s steel catch the moonlight. I flung myself into the yard, barely avoiding the attack.",28,71
1psp7ch,,"As I tumbled into the grass, I heard a car door slam behind me. I peered up and saw…

…two police officers sprinting toward me. *Thank God.* “Help!",28,72
1psp7ch,,"Please!” I pointed to the house. “She’s got a weapon!”

The officers, an older man and a younger woman, rushed past me.",22,73
1psp7ch,,"The demonic woman just stood in the doorway, watching us, then stepped back inside and shut the door.",18,74
1psp7ch,,"The younger officer did her best to stay calm as she hunched over me. “Do you have a back door?”

“Yes. That way.”

The older officer circled around back.",29,75
1psp7ch,,"I heard him kick open the back door and sprint inside. “Stay put,” the younger officer commanded me. She bolted to the front door and tried the knob.",28,76
1psp7ch,,“All clear!” Her partner's voice shouted over her shoulder-walkie. I breathed a sigh of relief as the older officer cranked open the front door and allowed his partner inside.,29,77
1psp7ch,,"They came back out moments later, eyes clouded in mystery. “She’s gone,” the younger officer said. ***

My wife and I couldn’t stay in our house after that.",28,78
1psp7ch,,We moved in with her parents days later and brought most of our things over.,15,79
1psp7ch,,"Some of our items are still at our old place, but we refuse to go back. What’s terrifying us now is my wife’s hair. It won't grow back.",28,80
1psp7ch,,"No matter what she does, the left side of her hair is still missing. And her eyebrow? It won’t regrow either.",21,81
1psp7ch,,She has to use a fake brow to appear normal. I just hope that the nightmares don’t start again.,19,82
1psp7ch,,"Part of me wonders if the woman is tied to our old place, or if she's somehow able to transfer to our new home.",24,83

I slumped back in my chair, faking a grin, toying with the hair in my pocket.",19,23
1pslfrg,,"When that wasn’t providing relief, I swapped to old reliable: my fidget ring. A mobile, spinnable band over a stationary inner band. A tactile outlet for my never-ending worry.",29,24
1pslfrg,,"Afterwards, Fox pulled me into his office and closed the door. “So - what’d you think?",16,25

I paced around his office, avoiding eye contact, thumbing the hair in my pocket. Could Tim really be gunning for my position?",26,26

“Hmm?” I stalled my hectic pirouettes, unaware that Fox had sat down behind his desk. He gestured towards a nearby chair.",22,28

I trailed off, distracted.",23,31

Fox leaned forward. His shoulders tensed.",18,33
1pslfrg,,"“You believe his work was plagiarized?” 

I scratched the back of my head, contemplated the potential ramifications of doubling down for about a quarter of a second, then nodded.",29,34

The rest of the day devolved into a hazy panic. Didn’t get a shred of work done.",24,37

Sleep evaded me that night. I tossed and turned, writhing well into the morning hours like a man possessed.",23,42

I only looked away for a moment.",29,53

1pslfrg,,"The moment I left the band to focus on my career, his attitude towards me shifted 180 degrees. Cold, vacant stares. Forced smiles.",23,67
1pslfrg,,"Never sat next to me at the bar anymore. The changes were subtle, but they were there.",17,68
1pslfrg,,"I just needed proof, and the thing in the pipes was more than happy to oblige. Of course, Rattle wasn’t perfect: the notes often contained small clerical errors.",28,69
1pslfrg,,"For example, my sister’s name is “Meg”, not “Marge”. And the note about Calvin mentioned him despising me for leaving the “team”, when it should have said the “band”.",29,70
1pslfrg,,Wasn’t a problem.,3,71
1pslfrg,,"In both cases, I knew what they were *intending* to say, and, far as I could tell, Rattle was right about those bastards every time, so what did it matter?",30,72

1pslfrg,,"I feared the worst, but didn’t want to jump to conclusions. My fiancé was still at work when I heard a rattling below the floorboards that evening.",27,74
1pslfrg,,"I pushed myself from the couch, plodded into the kitchen, and stood over the kitchen sink.",16,75
1pslfrg,,"*Any second now.* 

There was a faint scent drifting through the air, one I had trouble placing. It was woody, but with a peculiar hint of sweetness.",27,76
1pslfrg,,"Eucalyptus with a drop of honey. Whatever the scent was, it didn’t raise any red flags. In fact, I found the phantasmal aromatherapy quite relaxing.",25,77
1pslfrg,,"As I waited, my finger stopped incessantly spinning my fidget ring, and the grinding *squeaks* stopped in turn. Silence blanketed our house. Even the muffled rattling had ceased.",28,78

A low, whirring clamor blared through the room. Cold metal cradled my wrist.",22,81
1pslfrg,,"Artificial wind pushed between my fingers, like the breeze from a fan cranked to its max settings. My right hand was pressing into the drain. The garbage disposal was on.",30,82
1pslfrg,,"I leapt back, ripping my hand out. A searing pain exploded across my middle finger.",15,83
1pslfrg,,"Cereal boxes and cans of soup clattered against the floor as my shoulders slammed into the pantry shelves. Eventually, the discord settled.",22,84
1pslfrg,,"Excluding my labored breathing, the house was silent again; the whirring clamor had disappeared. Across the room, the switch for the disposal was in the “off” position.",27,85

1pslfrg,,"A nickel-sized slice of skin had been cleanly excised from above my knuckle. The injury was superficial. No wound to sew back together; just a patch of raw, gushing tissue.",30,88
1pslfrg,,I wrapped the finger with paper towels and crept over to the sink. A note was resting in the drain. The accompanying hair was silver and brittle.,27,89
1pslfrg,,"I opened it, surprised to find that there was a second note concealed inside the first. Rattle had never done that before.",22,90
1pslfrg,,"In jagged blue letters, the larger read: 

*ARDIN IS SLEEPING WITH HER BOSS*

In delicate black typography, that second, smaller one read: 

*It’s time, Pete.",25,91

There was a flicker in my chest. A brief rebellion.",25,92
1pslfrg,,"An honest recognition of the outlandish situation I’d found myself in. Before that ember could bloom, however, it was snuffed out. A sweet, woody scent slithered up my nostrils.",29,93

“Where the fuck is the Kindle charger, Pete?” Arden ripped open my nightstand’s bottom drawer.",20,103
1pslfrg,,"Normally, it required a key, but it was an old piece of furniture. In her rage, she’d pulled on the handle with enough force to break the aging lock altogether.",30,104

1pslfrg,,"I kept the tufts of hair on one side and the notes on the other. By that point, the drawer was nearly full.",23,106
1pslfrg,,"A bevy of useless half-words lurched over my tongue, none of which provided even a semblance of an explanation.",19,107
1pslfrg,,"Eventually, I mustered something like: 

“I’ve been receiving...messages.” 

The only thing she said in response was: 

“But...this is your handwriting, Pete.” 

Arden slung the duffel bag over her shoulder and practically sprinted from our home.",35,108

1pslfrg,,"I was used to feeling relief after confronting people with what Rattle divulged to me, but that time was different.",20,110
1pslfrg,,"At that moment, alone in an empty house, I did not experience relief. I just felt hollow. The minutes that followed are a bit of a blur.",27,111
1pslfrg,,"I don’t think I passed out. Not fully, at least. I floated above my own body, but I couldn’t really see anything. Just shapes lumbering through a thick, blinding mist.",30,112
1pslfrg,,"I resigned myself. Embraced the detachment. I didn’t feel worth the trouble of it all: letting Rattle protect me was much, much easier. Then, it hit me.",27,113

The paranoia untangled. The mist cleared. Painful remorse fell over me like a landslide.",28,114

“I will say the noises in your particular room are a little...strange. Shrill.",25,125

1psj2sv,,"“I’m not here alone…”

He’d seen her almost immediately. A shape in the distance, darker than the beige, moving against the current like she had weight. A girl, maybe.",29,11
1psj2sv,,"A woman. Someone human enough that his heart leapt when he noticed her. He waved. She didn’t wave back, but she didn’t disappear either. “See?” he told Marge.",28,12
1psj2sv,,"“I’m not alone. There are others. So maybe I’m here by mistake. They’ll figure this out.”

Marge swallowed.",18,13
1psj2sv,,She didn’t tell him that everyone else said the same thing at first. That they always thought they saw someone.,20,14
1psj2sv,,"The phenomenon didn’t discriminate by age, but the couples it chose tended to have history.",15,15
1psj2sv,,"Years and decades, sharing lives so deeply intertwined that betrayal didn’t always carry repercussions, but weight. Cheating was the most common offense. Lying came second.",25,16
1psj2sv,,"Sometimes it was something harder to define, emotional abandonment, quiet cruelty, a thousand small choices that added up to harm.",20,17
1psj2sv,,"The rule of The Void revealed itself slowly, but once it was understood, it was always the same:
The other person was given a date and time. A choice.",29,18
1psj2sv,,"Donnie didn’t believe that part until Marge showed him the notification on her phone. It appeared like a reminder text she hadn’t subscribed to. A simple text, no sender.",29,19
1psj2sv,,"RETURN WINDOW:
Saturday, (DATE REDACTED) 11:30 a.m. Failure to arrive will be considered FINAL. “If you come back,” Donnie said, “what happens?”
Marge hesitated.",24,20
1psj2sv,,"“They say… if I come back, you can come out.”
Donnie exhaled sharply. “Then that’s it.",16,21
1psj2sv,,"That’s the solution, just wait until then and get me the hell out of here.”
But there was another rule. One no one liked to say out loud.",28,22
1psj2sv,,You couldn’t force the release. The person outside had to choose to return. Love mattered. Trust mattered. The Void didn’t accept transactions made out of feelings of obligation alone.,29,23
1psj2sv,,That was why so many people never came back. The first night was hard in The Void.,17,24
1psj2sv,,The portal between The Void and the real world was opaque on his end. The girl he thought he saw was nowhere in sight once he was alone.,28,25
1psj2sv,,"One moment she was there, still distant, still indistinct, and the next she was gone, like The Void had erased the idea of her.",24,26
1psj2sv,,"Like it tricked him into believing he’d have some sort of companionship, as if he deserved it.",17,27
1psj2sv,,"Donnie was spinning in his mind, dark static matter whipping faster around him, his voice echoing, as if swallowed before it could travel. “That’s not fair,” he said.",28,28
1psj2sv,,"Marge heard it through the portal, warped and thin.",9,29
1psj2sv,,"She could see him, if she wanted to, by summoning the portal via the link on her phone, but she had the option to allow him to see her.",29,30
1psj2sv,,She chose to keep her presence unknown. After a few days she stopped seeing him regularly. The thought of him begging her became too much to handle.,27,31
1psj2sv,,"She chose to just watch. “This isn’t fair. You chose me for this, didn’t you? How could you do this?”

His words broke apart. He stopped finishing sentences.",28,32
1psj2sv,,"“That’s not fair,” he repeated, softer now, like he was trying to convince something that didn’t listen. Marge cried after that. She cried because she loved him.",27,33
1psj2sv,,"She cried because she remembered being young with him, because decades of shared life don’t evaporate just because trust fractures. She cried because she was lonely.",26,34
1psj2sv,,"And she cried because, deep down, she believed that if she didn’t go back for him, something would come for her eventually anyway.",23,35
1psj2sv,,"Karma, consequence, God, whatever name you gave it, she felt its breath on her neck. Saturday came. Marge returned. The Void spit Donnie out.",24,36
1psj2sv,,"He collapsed onto the bedroom floor, solid again, crying and laughing at once. The Void sealed behind them like it had never existed. People said it was beautiful.",28,37
1psj2sv,,People said it was proof love could redeem. But…I didn’t say anything. I couldn’t stop thinking that Donnie had deserved to stay. That The Void had been right.,28,38
1psj2sv,,"That Marge had confused compassion with justice. I said it too many times. At family gatherings. In hushed conversations. Once, too loudly. “He cheated,” I said.",26,39
1psj2sv,,"“Why does he deserve to come back?” 
We’d known Marge and Donnie for years. My grandparents church friends.",18,40
1psj2sv,,"We’d known they had their problems, and Marge couldn’t leave so we supported her the best way we could. This felt like just desserts.",24,41
1psj2sv,,People told me I was being cruel. Donnie avoided my eyes at ever Sunday dinner. I wish I had just stopped talking.,22,42
1psj2sv,,"Because The Void doesn’t disappear when it’s done with someone. When a person leaves The Void, they’re given something else. A submission. The rules came out slowly, like an infection.",30,43
1psj2sv,,"If someone escaped, they could anonymously submit another person into the system. The Void would pair them with the person who had loved them most and been wronged by them.",30,44
1psj2sv,,Love was the key. Not current love. Not forgiveness. But the deepest imprint. The Void didn’t care how much time had passed. Mine came on a Tuesday afternoon.,28,45
1psj2sv,,"My phone buzzed while I was standing in line at a grocery store, staring at nothing. I almost ignored it. Almost. VOID PAIRING CONFIRMED. PARTNER: Sabrina. I dropped my phone.",30,46
1psj2sv,,"I started shaking before I understood why. Sabrina. We were young. We were stupid. We were real in the way only first loves are real, messy, blinding, precious.",28,47
1psj2sv,,She loved me more purely than anyone ever has. And I took her for granted. I didn’t cheat. Not like Donnie. That almost made it worse. I was careless. Dismissive.,30,48
1psj2sv,,"I assumed she’d always be there, waiting for me to decide she mattered. By the time I realized what I had lost, she was already gone. I screamed.",28,49
1psj2sv,,I screamed that I wouldn’t go. That I refused. That they couldn’t make me. Because I knew the rule that mattered most.,22,50
1psj2sv,,"The person outside has to choose to come back. And I didn’t know if Sabrina loved me anymore. So here I am, waiting for The Void to devour me.",29,51
1psj2sv,,I know I won’t be coming out once I go in. The Void doesn’t care if you’ve changed. It only cares what love remembers.,24,52
1psj2sv,,I don’t know how much time I have. People think The Void is rare. It’s not. It’s just waiting and listening. People aren’t playthings. Hearts aren’t toys.,27,53
1psj2sv,,"Love isn’t a game. Check your phones. If you see a name you don’t remember, or worse, one you do, don’t ignore it.",23,54
1psj2sv,,"If you ever hurt someone who loved you, really loved you, pray they forgot. Because The Void hasn’t.",18,55
1psj0mr,I Was Too Depressed to Leave My Apartment. Then My Parents Sent Me a Christmas Gift.,"“Dad, what is this package?” I asked into the phone, staring angrily at the large wooden crate sitting in the middle of my living room.",25,0
1psj0mr,,"“Well… you know… it’s supposed to help,” he said hesitantly. “How should I put it… with your problem.”

I rubbed my eyes hard, already exhausted.",25,1
1psj0mr,,"My dad kept talking, stumbling over his words, trying to explain how this thing was supposed to improve my depression.",20,2
1psj0mr,,"“Dad…” I tried to cut in, but by then my mom had joined the call too. “I don’t need this crap.",21,3
1psj0mr,,"We already talked about this.”

“I know, Pete,” my dad said quickly. “But this might actually help! I read about it in the paper.",24,4
1psj0mr,,"They specialize in people like you.”

“People like me?” I shot back coldly. “You mean crazy people?”

“Oh, Pete, don’t say that,” my mom said softly.",26,5
1psj0mr,,"“You’re not crazy… you’re just not feeling well right now. We know that.”

“Yeah,” I muttered. “Mom, Dad, I think I should go now.",24,6
1psj0mr,,"I’m really not in the mood for this.”

“Wait—wait, Pete,” my mom said urgently. “What if… what if you came home for Christmas? It’s only two days away.",28,7
1psj0mr,,"Christmas Eve is coming up… You wouldn’t have to be alone.”

I walked over to the window. The curtains were drawn, like always.",23,8
1psj0mr,,"I pulled them aside just enough to look outside. Everything was gray. Dark. Cold winter weather. “I don’t think so, Mom,” I said flatly.",24,9
1psj0mr,,"“But please… have that thing picked up. I don’t want it. Bye.”

I hung up. I know it was a shitty way to act, but I just couldn’t do it.",30,10
1psj0mr,,"I’d been like this for almost six months. One day, it just hit me—I didn’t want to do anything anymore. I couldn’t go to work.",25,11
1psj0mr,,"I didn’t want to talk to anyone. I didn’t want to see anyone. And eventually, it got worse. I stopped leaving my apartment altogether. It’s been almost two months now.",30,12
1psj0mr,,"Every day, I just sit here inside…
drifting around my own life like I’m not really part of it anymore. I dropped onto my couch.",25,13
1psj0mr,,"The sunken spot where I’d been spending most of my days lately. The TV was on, like always. I wasn’t really watching it.",23,14
1psj0mr,,"I just knew it was there—programs flickering, scenes changing—while I stared straight through it, not actually processing any of it. My phone lit up again.",25,15
1psj0mr,,"It was a text from my dad. “The courier can’t pick the package back up until next week.”

“Great…” I muttered. I glanced at the crate.",26,16
1psj0mr,,"They’d left it right in the middle of my living room, exactly where it was in the way of everything.",20,17
1psj0mr,,"I didn’t recognize the delivery service, and honestly, I didn’t care.",11,18
1psj0mr,,"I hadn’t even wanted to accept it—but of course, the food delivery guy showed up at the exact same time, and I signed for everything without really thinking.",28,19
1psj0mr,,"And now it was here. I just sat there, staring at the tall wooden crate. I don’t even know why it bothered me so much.",25,20
1psj0mr,,"My living room was already a mess—trash everywhere, empty boxes, dirty clothes—but somehow this thing completely threw off the whole picture. I kept staring at the TV.",27,21
1psj0mr,,That was basically my plan for the rest of the day anyway. Then something slammed—hard.,15,22
1psj0mr,,"Over the dull background noise of the TV, it sounded like a gunshot going off in my living room. I jumped to my feet, my heart skipping a beat.",29,23
1psj0mr,,"I looked around, nothing unusual at first… and then I saw it. One of the metal rivets had shot out of the crate.",23,24
1psj0mr,,"The lid was partially shifted, like something inside had shoved it. “What the hell…?” I muttered, shuffling closer.",18,25
1psj0mr,,The lethargy I’d been stuck in for days made even those few steps feel like exhausting physical labor. I pressed my hand against the loose lid.,26,26
1psj0mr,,"The frame was cracked where the rivet had blown out. I thought about thermal expansion. Or poor construction. Anything, really. But was it actually that cold outside?",27,27
1psj0mr,,"“Ah, damn it…” I sighed. “I hope Dad gets his money back.”

Out of the corner of my eye, I spotted the rivet. It was embedded in the wall.",29,28
1psj0mr,,"Half-buried in the drywall, like it had been fired from a nail gun. I walked over, kicked aside a pizza box, and leaned in closer. The rivet was lodged deep.",30,29
1psj0mr,,I shook my head. Of course this would happen at a time when I barely had the energy to exist. Then there was another loud crack.,26,30
1psj0mr,,"This time, the lid split completely open. “You gotta be kidding me…” I muttered. “Go ahead. Try to scare me.”

I shuffled back to the crate.",26,31
1psj0mr,,"Somehow, this was the biggest effort I’d made all week, which felt almost ironic. I slid the shifted lid aside and peered through the opening.",25,32
1psj0mr,,"For a second, I didn’t understand what I was looking at. Then it clicked. My dad had been completely ripped off. The crate was empty.",25,33
1psj0mr,,I slumped back onto the couch.,6,34
1psj0mr,,I wanted to call my dad and tell him that whatever they’d supposedly picked out specifically to help me didn’t even exist—but I just couldn’t bring myself to do it.,30,35
1psj0mr,,I didn’t feel like talking to them. I didn’t feel like doing anything. I just wanted to sit. To exist. To not think.,23,36
1psj0mr,,"So I kept sitting there, staring at the TV with my brain switched off. Shows blurred into each other while I sank deeper and deeper into the couch.",28,37
1psj0mr,,"It felt like my body was slowly melting into it. It didn’t take long before sleep pulled me under. “Pete… Pete, wake up.”

A soft voice. Somewhere far away.",29,38
1psj0mr,,"Half a dream. “Pete. Santa’s almost here. Wake up.”

My eyes snapped open. For a second, I just sat there, disoriented.",21,39
1psj0mr,,It was a strange dream—especially since I hadn’t been dreaming at all lately. The apartment was still dark.,18,40
1psj0mr,,"The TV was still blasting the same mindless shows at the same volume, like it hadn’t changed scenes in hours.",20,41
1psj0mr,,The crate was still in the middle of the living room. But the lid had completely slid off. It was lying on the floor. I slowly pushed myself up.,29,42
1psj0mr,,"At least I could still manage the bathroom. I hadn’t had the energy to shower in weeks, but somehow I always made it to the toilet.",26,43
1psj0mr,,"When I reached the bathroom door, I grabbed the handle. It didn’t move. I pushed harder. Nothing. “What the fuck?” I muttered, staring at the door.",26,44
1psj0mr,,"I yanked on the handle again, like I was only just realizing something was wrong. The lock didn’t click. It didn’t resist. It didn’t jam. It just wouldn’t open.",29,45
1psj0mr,,"I shook my head, confused. I probably locked it earlier and just don’t remember, I thought. Or maybe I imagined the whole thing.",23,46
1psj0mr,,"Time had been bleeding together for days now. But when I turned back toward the living room, Everything changed. I wasn’t standing in the living room anymore.",27,47
1psj0mr,,I was already inside the bathroom. The door was behind me—the same door that wouldn’t let me in a second ago.,21,48
1psj0mr,,"And in front of me, impossibly, was the exit back into the living room. Like someone had swapped out the stage set around me. Instantly. Without any transition.",28,49
1psj0mr,,"I looked around in panic. My dark, exhausted eyes couldn’t make sense of what I was seeing. I think I was actually starting to lose my mind.",27,50
1psj0mr,,"I peed and, with this empty, numb feeling, somehow accepted the fact that I had… teleported into the bathroom. Or maybe my brain had just skipped a beat.",28,51
1psj0mr,,Maybe I’d walked in here and simply didn’t remember it. That kind of thing wasn’t exactly rare for me anymore.,20,52
1psj0mr,,"I expected the door not to open on the way out either. But the moment I pressed the handle, the lock clicked open like it always had.",27,53
1psj0mr,,"What I walked back into, though, wasn’t my living room.",10,54
1psj0mr,,"All the trash that had been piling up for months—pizza boxes, empty bottles, garbage bags, clothes, scraps of packaging—had been stacked into a single grotesque tower.",26,55
1psj0mr,,"Like someone had gathered it all deliberately and arranged it with care. The pile nearly reached the ceiling. A half-collapsed, reeking pizza box sat on top of it.",28,56
1psj0mr,,"Like a disgusting Christmas tree topper. “What the fuck…?” I whispered, staring at the trash-tree in disbelief. I hadn’t even finished processing that when I noticed something else.",28,57
1psj0mr,,The TV—which had been talking nonstop for months—was now nothing but static. That constant white noise. The kind that had always been tied to nightmares when I was a kid.,30,58
1psj0mr,,"I moved closer, slowly. The image was completely distorted. Colors bleeding into each other. Shapes warped and wrong. And yet, I could still tell what was playing. Home Alone.",29,59
1psj0mr,,Only it looked like the movie itself was melting. Then something shifted in the corner of my vision. I froze. My bedroom door was open.,25,60
1psj0mr,,"And inside the darkness… something was standing there. Right in the doorway. Positioned so the shadows still swallowed it, but not enough to hide its outline.",26,61
1psj0mr,,"And then I saw the eyes. Two greenish, button-like points of light. Locked onto me. Unblinking. Perfectly still. It stared at me in silence. Like it had always been there.",30,62
1psj0mr,,"The air caught in my chest. “Who are you?” I asked, my voice shaking. “What are you doing in my apartment?”

The dark figure didn’t answer.",26,63
1psj0mr,,"Its tall silhouette just stared at me, completely motionless, like it couldn’t even hear my voice. The static from the TV seemed to grow louder.",25,64
1psj0mr,,My heart was pounding in my chest. “Can’t you hear me?” I swallowed hard. “How did you get in here?,20,65
1psj0mr,,"I’m calling the police if you don’t leave.”

I reached out blindly, feeling along the wall for the light switch in the dim glow of the TV.",27,66
1psj0mr,,"When I finally found it, I slammed it down almost instinctively, panic taking over. And then two things happened at once. First—the lights actually turned on. That alone surprised me.",30,67
1psj0mr,,I would’ve sworn I hadn’t used them in months. Second… The figure was gone. Not just it.,17,68
1psj0mr,,"The trash Christmas tree in the corner vanished too, like it had never been there.",15,69
1psj0mr,,"The TV image snapped back to normal, the static cut out, and Kevin McCallister’s voice came through the speakers clearly.",20,70
1psj0mr,,"“What the fuck was that…?” I muttered, rubbing my eyes and talking to myself. “Am I really losing my mind?”

I cautiously peeked into the bedroom. There was nothing there.",30,71
1psj0mr,,"No one. The room stared back at me, empty. Just the tangled bed and the wrinkled, overused blanket. I collapsed onto the bed.",23,72
1psj0mr,,"I stared at the ceiling, and before I could put together a single coherent thought, sleep took me. When I opened my eyes, it was morning.",26,73
1psj0mr,,Sunlight filtered weakly through the curtains. The light in the living room was still on. I must have left it that way overnight.,23,74
1psj0mr,,"I stumbled out of the bedroom and looked around, confused. Not just the trash tower was gone. Everything was gone.",20,75
1psj0mr,,"In place of my filthy, garbage-filled mess was a clean, neat, almost cozy apartment. Like someone had spent days doing nothing but cleaning. Like it didn’t belong to me anymore.",30,76
1psj0mr,,"I rubbed my eyes and wandered into the kitchen. I made coffee. No matter how much I hated everything, I never skipped my morning coffee.",25,77
1psj0mr,,"Then, like I’d completed some important task, I dropped onto the couch. Same as always. Time for another day of nothing. I don’t know how long I sat there.",29,78
1psj0mr,,I just stared at the TV. I didn’t care what was on. It was enough. I didn’t want to think. I didn’t want anything. Until the TV suddenly shut off.,30,79
1psj0mr,,"“What the hell?” I frowned. I started looking for the remote, but it was like it had vanished. I couldn’t find it anywhere.",23,80
1psj0mr,,"I stood in the middle of the living room, hands on my hips, turning in circles in frustration. That’s when I noticed the curtain had been pulled aside.",28,81
1psj0mr,,"The windowsill was visible. And there it was—outside, beyond the glass—resting peacefully. The TV remote. I trudged over, irritated, grabbed the curtain to pull it back, and it ripped free.",30,82
1psj0mr,,"Not just fell. Like someone had torn it straight out of the wall. The rod and the curtain crashed down in front of me, nearly giving me a heart attack.",30,83
1psj0mr,,“God damn it!” I shouted. I barely managed to jump out of the way. I stared at the holes in the wall where the rod had been seconds earlier.,29,84
1psj0mr,,"“You know what…” I muttered, kicking the pile of fabric aside. “Fuck this.”

I turned and headed back toward the bedroom, angry and exhausted.",24,85
1psj0mr,,"I had absolutely zero desire—none—to deal with any more of this weird shit. I was going to crawl into bed and rot there. But as I started walking, something changed.",30,86
1psj0mr,,"The sun was still shining in through the window behind me… but it was being blocked. By something rising up, swallowing the light. I turned around.",26,87
1psj0mr,,The fallen curtain was lifting. Pointed at the top. Like someone was standing beneath it. A shape began to form. The curtain rose higher and higher. I couldn’t move.,29,88
1psj0mr,,"My throat tightened, air barely making it into my lungs. I backed away until I hit the bedroom doorway. The curtain was almost brushing the ceiling now.",27,89
1psj0mr,,The bottom barely touched the floor. Then it stopped. I stood there shaking. Cold ran down my spine. The curtain hovered in place. Completely still.,25,90
1psj0mr,,"For a moment, it felt like everything had frozen. I locked eyes with my own curtain. Then it lunged at me. I didn’t think. Instinct took over.",27,91
1psj0mr,,"I jumped into the bedroom, slammed the door shut, and threw my full weight against it. A soft thump hit the door.",22,92
1psj0mr,,"Like someone had just tossed the curtain against it. I braced myself there, mouth dry, waiting. Nothing. Silence. Calm. I didn’t dare open the door.",25,93
1psj0mr,,"I pressed my ear against it, listening. And then something slammed into the door, hard. Into me. I flew backward, crashing into the wall.",24,94
1psj0mr,,"The door exploded out of its frame. The last thing I saw before everything went black, was sunlight pouring into the living room. I came to slowly.",27,95
1psj0mr,,"I was lying on the floor of my bedroom, my back against the wall. It had gotten dark while I was out.",22,96
1psj0mr,,"Even so, I could clearly see that the door leading into the living room was gone. Not open. Gone.",19,97
1psj0mr,,"Its broken pieces were scattered across the floor, like something had blasted straight through it.",15,98
1psj0mr,,"I struggled to my feet, my head still swimming, and only then did I really start to process what had happened.",21,99
1psj0mr,,"I looked around in panic, searching for the curtain-shaped thing. There was nothing there. My curtain lay crumpled in the living room, harmless fabric again.",25,100
1psj0mr,,"I stepped out carefully, half-expecting something to jump at me—but nothing did. Everything looked exactly like it had that morning. The apartment was clean. Organized.",25,101
1psj0mr,,"And completely empty, except for me. I hurried into the kitchen to get some water. But the moment I stepped inside, my heart nearly stopped. The refrigerator was open.",29,102
1psj0mr,,"I approached it slowly, terrified that something would leap out. My hand was shaking as I looked inside. The fridge was almost as empty as it always was. Almost.",29,103
1psj0mr,,"There was one thing inside. A gingerbread house. It sat on a small plate, carefully placed. White and pale-purple icing covered the roof, forming my mom’s initials.",27,104
1psj0mr,,Exactly like the ones she used to make when I was a kid. Every single Christmas. But… how was this here now? I slammed the fridge door shut.,28,105
1psj0mr,,I was really starting to get sick of all this weird shit. I sat down on the couch again. The TV wasn’t working at all now.,26,106
1psj0mr,,I didn’t even bother looking for the remote anymore.,9,107
1psj0mr,,"I had no idea what was happening in my apartment, whether I’d completely lost my mind… or something far worse was going on.",23,108
1psj0mr,,That’s when my eyes drifted back to the wooden crate.,10,109
1psj0mr,,"The empty box was still there in the living room, pushed neatly against the wall, like it had always belonged there.",21,110
1psj0mr,,"“This piece of shit is still here…” I muttered to myself. “Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells…”

A strange voice started singing softly. It was coming from the crate.",27,111
1psj0mr,,Someone was singing inside it. The voice was rough and raspy—like a very old man… or someone who’d never really learned how to speak properly.,25,112
1psj0mr,,"“What the fuck is this…?” I whispered, frozen. Then two black hands rose up out of the crate.",18,113
1psj0mr,,"They grabbed the edge, like whatever was inside was struggling to pull itself out. “Oh what fun it is to ride…” the voice continued.",24,114
1psj0mr,,"A dark, thin shadow slowly lifted itself out of the crate. Its green eyes glowed in the dim light. And it kept singing. It was singing the Christmas song.",29,115
1psj0mr,,"My heart was racing. I thought I was about to pass out right there. And then, as if this still wasn’t enough. My phone started ringing on the couch.",29,116
1psj0mr,,I didn’t think. I grabbed it and ran for the bathroom. “Dashing through the snow…” the shadow croaked behind me as it climbed out of the crate.,27,117
1psj0mr,,"I burst into the bathroom, slammed the door shut, and locked it. I flipped on the light instantly, and panic took over—I dove into the bathtub.",26,118
1psj0mr,,I was gripping my phone so hard I thought it might crack. And only then did I look at the screen. Dad was calling. “Dad!” I shouted into the phone.,30,119
1psj0mr,,"“What is this crate? What did you send me?!”

“Oh, Pete…” my dad said, surprised. “I didn’t think you’d answer.",20,120
1psj0mr,,"I just wanted to wish you a Merry Christmas…”

“Okay, fine,” I snapped. “There’s someone here, Dad! I need help!”

That’s when something started pounding on the bathroom door.",29,121
1psj0mr,,"Not knocking. Pounding—like fists slamming into it. The whole room shook. “Dad, listen to me—this is really bad,” I was almost screaming now.",23,122
1psj0mr,,"“What did you buy me?!”

“Well… a gift, Pete,” he said calmly. “That’s your Christmas present.”

“What?!” I stammered. “Where did you even get something like that?!”

“Ho. Ho.",29,123
1psj0mr,,"Ho.”

The voice came through the phone. It wasn’t my dad. “What the hell was that?” I asked, terrified. “Oh, that’s great, Pete,” my dad said cheerfully. “Santa’s here.",29,124
1psj0mr,,"He just arrived. Come say hello.”

“Ho. Ho. Ho, Pete,” someone said, taking the phone. “It’s Christmas, for fuck’s sake. Don’t be such a coward.",25,125
1psj0mr,,"Get out of the tub and celebrate.”

“What the fuck is happening?!” I screamed. “Ho. Ho. Ho…” the voice laughed. I hung up. This was all insanity.",27,126
1psj0mr,,"Something was still slamming against the bathroom door—but the worst part came next. “Ho. Ho. Ho.”

The same voice. But now it was inside the bathroom. Coming from the closet.",30,127
1psj0mr,,“Ho. Ho. Ho…” it grew louder. Cold sweat ran down my neck. My head was ringing. The sounds blurred together. I was panicking. I had no other choice.,28,128
1psj0mr,,"I climbed out of the tub and rushed to the window. The fire escape was right there. My only chance. I pulled the curtain aside, and something was standing outside.",30,129
1psj0mr,,"It was big. Brown. Flat. I squinted into the darkness, and my stomach dropped when I realized what it was. A gingerbread man stood on the fire escape.",28,130
1psj0mr,,"As tall as me. And it was waving. I yanked the curtain shut. “Ho. Ho. Ho! I’m right here, Pete!” the stupid Santa voice called from the closet.",28,131
1psj0mr,,"“Go fuck yourselves!” I screamed, and lunged for the bathroom door. I ripped it open and burst out. The living room was empty. The black, singing shadow was gone.",29,132
1psj0mr,,"For a second, I didn’t even know where to run. Then it started. Bells. Small bells, like a thousand of them ringing at once.",24,133
1psj0mr,,Carol of the Bells screamed from every direction. I could feel it pounding in my chest. My head went numb.,20,134
1psj0mr,,"“Shut up!” I yelled, dropping to the floor and clamping my hands over my ears. That’s when something jumped onto my back. Like a sack being thrown over me.",29,135
1psj0mr,,"A bony, clawed hand twisted my arm behind me, while the other dug deep into my skull. I screamed. “It’s Christmas, Pete,” the black shadow whispered into my ear.",29,136
1psj0mr,,"I caught a glimpse of its emerald-green eyes at the edge of my vision. “Get the fuck off me!” I choked, thrashing with everything I had. The thing let go.",30,137
1psj0mr,,I threw myself forward. Crawled. Slid. Scrambled toward the front door. I was gasping like a wounded animal.,18,138
1psj0mr,,"I could feel blood running down my head, but the bells were still screaming. I reached the door and threw it open. The lock gave way. I ran.",28,139
1psj0mr,,"Down the hallway. Down the stairs. I slipped, fell down a few steps, smashed my arm into the railing—but I didn’t care. I just needed to get out.",28,140
1psj0mr,,I burst out of the building. The old wooden gate flew open. I jumped the last few steps. I was gasping for air.,23,141
1psj0mr,,"I leaned against the roof of my car, hands shaking. The street was empty. Lights were on in the surrounding apartments. Inside, people were celebrating.",25,142
1psj0mr,,The cold air turned my breath into white clouds. That’s when I noticed it. Snow. It was everywhere. I felt cold flakes melting on my head.,26,143
1psj0mr,,I looked up into the night and watched the snowfall grow thicker. I hadn’t seen snow in a long time. It was beautiful. Out here. In the open.,28,144
1psivx5,The Quiet Stretch (Part 1),"*I’ve been a long-haul trucker for years, and I wouldn’t be writing this if I hadn’t made it back.",19,0
1psivx5,,"Some roads don’t behave the way they should...*

---

Being a trucker was never something I considered.",17,1
1psivx5,,"But in those days, I couldn’t find a decent job with decent pay, and I had planned on doing it only for a few months before moving on to something better.",31,2
1psivx5,,"When I commenced, the routes were different each time. I was frequently assigned jobs that led to new locations, never the same ones twice.",24,3
1psivx5,,"I was often labelled the human GPS, because I could remember long-distance routes with extreme precision, exact spots where the dividers were slightly broken, the exact number of gas stations along the way, exact tyre repair centres.",37,4
1psivx5,,"You name it. That was what I consider the golden time, because that was when I met Martin.",18,5
1psivx5,,"He helped me a lot during my initiation as a trucker, especially when I was still learning the rhythms of the road and the unspoken rules that came with the job.",31,6
1psivx5,,"Martin was full of life and always cheerful. For every problem, he had a solution, and you could spot his smile from yards away.",24,7
1psivx5,,"Sometimes we’d happen to meet on a route, park our trucks nearby, and talk for hours about nothing in particular. Cigarettes were his weakness.",24,8
1psivx5,,"If he ever caught you smoking, he’d snatch one away and take enough puffs to leave you with nothing.",19,9
1psivx5,,"That was the only thing I hated about him, though even that was in a friendly way.",17,10
1psivx5,,"Lately, I had been assigned a job transporting vehicles to the same location twice in a row.",17,11
1psivx5,,"Since I was never a troublemaker, and I almost always gave my hundred percent, I was trusted more than most others.",21,12
1psivx5,,"Martin was trusted just as much, which made things easier when we needed favors.",14,13
1psivx5,,"During my first time on that route, after paying the toll, I noticed something strange in the rear-view mirror.",19,14
1psivx5,,"There was a brief flicker, as if something had flashed behind me, but I couldn’t see what it was.",19,15
1psivx5,,"My eyes were mostly fixed on the road ahead, and I eventually shrugged it off as some kind of mirage.",20,16
1psivx5,,"The highway was surrounded by forest, with no restaurants, local shops, or even mobile towers nearby.",16,17
1psivx5,,"To break the silence, I used to honk there, following the exact pattern of a song I loved.",18,18
1psivx5,,"The isolation made the route uncomfortable, and Martin would often step in for me when he could.",17,19
1psivx5,,"We’d exchange tasks whenever possible, and he had a habit of doing so before things went wrong, almost as if he sensed trouble ahead of time.",26,20
1psivx5,,"That time, Martin took the burden as usual.",8,21
1psivx5,,"He said calmly that I didn’t need to worry and that he’d take the route for me, joking that I should keep the cigarette packets ready in the glove box.",30,22
1psivx5,,"He laughed as he said it, like it was just another minor inconvenience. It was a task exchange like the ones we had done before.",25,23
1psivx5,,"I took his assignment instead, the one that involved going into the city, delivering a few goods, and returning without much hassle.",22,24
1psivx5,,"It was easy work, and I didn’t think much of it at the time. It was the last time we exchanged tasks.",22,25
1psivx5,,"The next time I was assigned the same route Martin had been covering for me, I called him to ask if he wanted to swap again.",26,26
1psivx5,,"He didn’t answer the phone, and when I tried later, it rang without response.",14,27
1psivx5,,"Around the same time, the company owner found out about our exchanges and immediately imposed strict restrictions on swapping assigned routes.",21,28
1psivx5,,"That made it my third time on the same stretch of highway. After a three-week halt between assignments, something felt off, though I hadn’t noticed it earlier.",27,29
1psivx5,,"The trouble wasn’t just that I disliked the route; it was that things kept happening there that never happened anywhere else. Minor injuries, the kind you dismiss at first.",29,30
1psivx5,,"Once, after setting the handbrake near the toll, I stepped down to grab my tools and the truck rolled forward anyway, crushing my foot before stopping on its own.",29,31
1psivx5,,"Another time, the rear-view mirror cracked without impact, and a shard flew loose and struck my cheek, missing my eye by inches.",22,32
1psivx5,,"I wrote it all off as fatigue, bad luck, coincidence, anything but the road itself.",15,33
1psivx5,,Perhaps I had been too anxious about finishing the job on time to pay attention to anything else.,18,34
1psivx5,,"There was a toll plaza on that route that I don’t wish to name. To an ordinary, worn-out driver, there was nothing strange about it at first glance.",28,35
1psivx5,,"The wrongness was subtle and easy to miss, and it usually took at least two trips along the same route before anyone noticed anything unusual.",25,36
1psivx5,,"Even then, most people wouldn’t, because whatever happened there wasn’t timed or predictable. It simply occurred when it wanted to.",20,37
1psivx5,,"The highway itself was mostly empty, and you could go minutes without seeing another vehicle.",15,38
1psivx5,,"While the road was only four lanes wide, the toll plaza stretched across six lanes, wider than it had any reason to be.",23,39
1psivx5,,"By the time you reached it, you were usually too eager to pay and drive off to waste time noticing details. The problem was Lane 7.",26,40
1psivx5,,"Sometimes it didn’t exist at all, and sometimes it did.",10,41
1psivx5,,"It shouldn’t have existed on a six-lane toll plaza, and when it appeared, it formed right next to the sixth lane.",21,42
1psivx5,,I was heading back towards home when I noticed it again.,11,43
1psivx5,,I had already driven past the toll plaza and was roughly two hundred meters away when I saw it in the rear-view mirror.,23,44
1psivx5,,"Lane 7 was flickering, carving a way for itself where there had been nothing before, and the road beneath me began to hum in a way I could feel through the tyres and into my chest.",36,45
1psivx5,,Lane 4 flickered briefly as well before returning to normal. I pulled the truck over and stopped.,17,46
1psivx5,,"Another truck approached the toll plaza on Lane 4, the same lane that had flickered moments ago in unison with Lane 7.",22,47
1psivx5,,"From where I was, I noticed that the toll attendants didn’t seem to move, though I was too far away to be certain.",23,48
1psivx5,,"As the truck drew closer, Lane 7 flickered once more before vanishing. I never saw the truck from Lane 4 pass through the toll. It was just there, static.",29,49
1psivx5,,"I thought maybe the truck driver had been stopped for some violation. That was the second time I noticed Lane 7, and I tried to blame it on exhaustion.",29,50
1psivx5,,"I wanted to prove myself wrong, because it would have been easier to believe I was imagining things. That was also why I never mentioned it to Martin.",28,51
1psivx5,,"I didn’t want to sound insane, and I was certain a carefree person like him wouldn’t believe me without proof. The next time, it was raining heavily.",27,52
1psivx5,,"I halted the truck at a lay-by and lit a cigarette before approaching the toll booth, deciding that I wanted to see what would happen if I paid attention.",29,53
1psivx5,,"As I drove toward the third lane, the road began to hum again, subdued, but unmistakable. That was when I saw Lane 7 come into existence out of nowhere.",29,54
1psivx5,,"It appeared like a flickering tube light struggling to turn on, flashing a few times before stabilizing completely.",18,55
1psivx5,,"It hadn’t been there moments earlier, just six ordinary lanes, and now a seventh stood beside the sixth, solid and undeniably wrong.",22,56
1psivx5,,"I wanted to leave immediately, so I pushed the accelerator and entered the booth area of Lane 3. At that exact moment, Lane 3 flickered in unison.",27,57
1psivx5,,"The moment I entered, everything froze around me. The booth attendants froze mid-motion. I stared through the windshield and saw the rain droplets stop, suspended in place.",27,58
1psivx5,,"All I could faintly move were my eyelids, while my vision began to fade.",14,59
1psivx5,,"Before time resumed, something crushed inward inside my head, dense and soundless pressure that left me blind with pain for a heartbeat too long.",24,60
1psivx5,,"When the world moved again, there was no trace of it left behind. Only silence that felt deliberate. Then everything moved again, and I entered an empty highway. [Part Two](",30,61
1pshqan,Keep Your Lights On,"I closed my door and flipped the light switch. Darkness. After a long day, it was finally time to get some sleep.",22,0
1pshqan,,"I knew the layout of my bedroom by heart, so I blindly walked over to where my bed should have been and collapsed onto it. I fell onto the carpet.",30,1
1pshqan,,The fall was so unexpected that I almost landed on my face—I barely reacted in time to put out my hands.,21,2
1pshqan,,"Suddenly filled with adrenaline from the fall, I jumped to my feet and stumbled backwards. *What...?*

Where was my bed? Disoriented and panicking, I reached backwards to find my dresser.",30,3
1pshqan,,"If I touched that, I could find my way back to the light switch. My dresser wasn't there, either. I swung around, reaching for something—anything—but found nothing.",27,4
1pshqan,,That was impossible; my room had furniture near almost every wall. My room was empty.,15,5
1pshqan,,"Confused beyond belief, and definitely not dreaming, I carefully shuffled to a wall and started running my hands along it. Soon, I found the door.",25,6
1pshqan,,"I reached next to it for the light switch. The light switch wasn't there. *What the hell is happening?*

Determined to find answers, I opened the door and stepped out.",30,7
1pshqan,,I'd turn on the hallway light and figure this out. I walked out onto the laminate floor and left the door open behind me.,24,8
1pshqan,,"The light switch was at the far end, so I hugged the left wall as I felt my way forward.",20,9
1pshqan,,"There was a foul smell in the hall, almost like rotten eggs. I tried not to gag as I shuffled along.",21,10
1pshqan,,I was almost to where I remembered the corner being—where the light switch was—when suddenly I was pressing against a solid wall. The hallway was now a dead end.,29,11
1pshqan,,Now I was freaking out. I crouched down against the wall and tried to control my breathing. I couldn't see. I was in my underwear. In the dark.,28,12
1pshqan,,"In some unknown place. It was all happening too fast. I sat there for a minute, collecting myself. After I had mostly regained control, I stood up.",27,13
1pshqan,,My best option was to go back to my room and check the rest of the walls more thoroughly.,19,14
1pshqan,,"I hugged the opposite side of the hall as I made my way back, making sure I didn't miss anything. The smell was getting stronger.",25,15
1pshqan,,"Suddenly, I slipped on something wet and fell forward—landing on a huge pile of something squishy. The smell was coming from this pile, and I quickly jumped back, disgusted.",29,16
1pshqan,,"It was some kind of wet trash, and it had gotten on me. I retched and shook my arms to flick it off.",23,17
1pshqan,,"From my room—down the hall—I heard a door creak open. *There was another door in my room?*

""Honey?"" a voice called. A chill went down my spine and I froze.",30,18
1pshqan,,"That voice sounded exactly like my mother. My mother, *who had been dead for ten years.*

""Honey?"" the voice repeated. ""Where are you?""

I didn't dare respond.",27,19
1pshqan,,"That was not my mother. Fear crept in. ""Are you okay?"" the voice asked. It was getting louder, closer to the hallway. I stood still.",25,20
1pshqan,,"My thoughts were racing and my body was paralyzed. ""Are you out here, honey?"" it asked. Something entered the hall.",20,21
1pshqan,,"I heard a series of small clicking noises on the laminate floor as the thing slowly made its way toward me. ""Honey, come out,"" the voice said. Horror seized me.",30,22
1pshqan,,The huge pile of trash was the only thing between me and whatever was coming.,15,23
1pshqan,,I was so afraid I didn't even think—I stepped up onto the pile and tried to hide myself in it. Getting filthy was a small price to pay for safety.,30,24
1pshqan,,"As I started to move aside the oddly-shaped pieces, I touched a roundish object. My hand brushed over it, and I felt a nose.",24,25
1pshqan,,I felt teeth in an open mouth. They were body parts. I had been touching body parts.,17,26
1pshqan,,"*I was digging into a pile of butchered corpses.*

I was so utterly terrified that I couldn't scream. My breath caught in my lungs.",24,27
1pshqan,,This may have saved me; the thing would have known where I was if I had.,16,28
1pshqan,,"""Let me help you, honey,"" the voice said, the clicking of its footsteps getting louder and quicker. It was now halfway between me and the room. I had to hide.",30,29
1pshqan,,"I tried to stop thinking about what I was burrowing into and continued to wedge myself deeper. ""Don't worry, I'm here now,"" the voice said.",25,30
1pshqan,,"It had almost reached the pile. Frantically, I squeezed the rest of my body into the pile. Soon I was completely covered, and no part of me was visible.",29,31
1pshqan,,"""Honey?"" the voice said, moving around the pile. I held perfectly still, trying not to breathe.",16,32
1pshqan,,"The smell was overpowering, and it took all of my willpower not to throw up. *It's just trash, not bodies,* I thought, over and over.",25,33
1pshqan,,"*It's just trash.*

The clicking noises stopped directly next to the pile. Silence. Suddenly, I could feel body parts being moved around on the surface. Right above my head.",29,34
1pshqan,,"I had never been so scared in my life. I wanted to scream, to run, but I didn't move.",19,35
1pshqan,,"Some kind of liquid from the dislodged body parts dripped down my face, across my nose, and over my mouth. It took absolutely everything not to retch.",27,36
1pshqan,,I gagged silently and almost made a noise. Body parts were being moved right next to me. I was about to be discovered.,23,37
1pshqan,,My own butchered body was going to join this pile. My heart thundered and its beat roared in my ears. I heard another voice near the door to my room.,30,38
1pshqan,,"""hE's nOT In hERE,"" it said. Its voice was unnatural, alien. The limbs stopped moving. The edge of my arm had been exposed. The thing had almost touched me.",29,39
1pshqan,,"""leT'S CHeCK thE OthER rOOm,"" the voice outside the pile said. It sounded completely different from my mother's voice—a hideous chittering from an inhuman mouth.",25,40
1pshqan,,"There were clicking noises on the laminate as it began moving away from me, back toward the door.",18,41
1pshqan,,"As the clicking disappeared into my room, I let out a long, shaking breath.",14,42
1pshqan,,I was trembling so hard that a few of the body parts dislodged and silently slid down the pile. I heard a different door open in my room.,28,43
1pshqan,,Tears rolled down my face. I just wanted to go home. They were going to find me when they came back. I needed to escape.,25,44
1pshqan,,"My only option was to go back to my room and search for the light switch, or find a different exit.",21,45
1pshqan,,"Driven by fear and desperation, I dug myself out of the pile. I was covered in disgusting fluid from the corpses.",21,46
1pshqan,,I made my way around the pile and back to the room as quickly and quietly as I could. I listened at the door. Heard nothing. I stepped inside.,29,47
1pshqan,,"Scared out of my mind, I began blindly running my hands along the wall, moving clockwise. I had to get out of here before they came back.",27,48
1pshqan,,"""Honey, where are you?"" the voice of my mother asked, somewhere in a different room behind me. I was sweating, shaking from fear and panic.",25,49
1pshqan,,"My trembling hands flew up and down the walls as I searched frantically. ""Is that you, honey?"" the voice called. It was just outside the room.",26,50
1pshqan,,"Absolute, primal horror enveloped me and squeezed. Adrenaline flooded my body. I was almost running now as I clawed at the wall. I couldn't breathe. Couldn't think.",27,51
1pshqan,,"""D**O**N'**T** R**U**N.""

It was in the room. It was right behind me. I screamed in utter terror. At the last moment, my hands felt a switch.",26,52
1pshqan,,"I flipped it, desperately, still screaming. The lights turned on. I could see. Crying out, I raised my hands to defend myself as I spun around. But nothing was there.",30,53
1pshqan,,"I was back in my room. My real room. My bed, my furniture, all of it—was back. As if nothing had happened. I had escaped.",25,54
1pshqan,,"I fell backwards against the wall and sank to the floor in shock. Looking down, I saw that I was covered in blood. I was too traumatized to react.",29,55
1pshqan,,"I sat there for twenty minutes, weeping. I couldn't stop shaking as I held my face in my hands. Eventually, I got up and grabbed my phone off the nightstand.",30,56
1pshqan,,"Using the flashlight, I turned on every light in the house. Only then did I take a shower. All of this happened last night. I haven't slept since.",28,57
1pshqan,,Even the darkness of closing my eyes brings terror. I only feel safe in the light.,16,58

1psgwvq,,"As expected, a few minutes after I turned on a random movie, I fall asleep only to be awakened by a horrible quaking and shaking.",25,38
1psgwvq,,"I sit up immediately, breathing heavily. I can feel my heart pump out of my chest as I grab my phone to use its flashlight.",25,39
1psgwvq,,"When I try to unlock it, I see the time and freeze. 9:30 pm. Not again. Who the FUCK redecorates their room? Every. Single. Damn. Night?!",26,40
1psgwvq,,At the same time too?! Also: Did I really sleep that long..?,12,41
1psgwvq,,With a sigh I get up to pour my cold coffee into the kitchen sink and notice that some stuff had fallen over.,23,42
1psgwvq,,"With a raised eyebrow, I put everything back into place and walk into the bedroom.",15,43
1psgwvq,,"When I enter, a sudden sharp pain fills me and I drop to the floor, grabbing my foot. ""God fucking damnit..."" I say through my clenched teeth.",27,44
1psgwvq,,I must have hit my foot against a table that is near the entrance of the room. But how?... It doesn't make any sense to me.,26,45
1psgwvq,,"I just shake my head violently, wanting to forget about it. It's probably nothing. My brain and body must be fucked up from the restless nights and ruined sleep schedule.",30,46
1psgwvq,,"I go to bed. Pull the covers up to my chin and lay on my back, staring at the ceiling. The longer I look at it, the weirder it feels.",30,47
1psgwvq,,"Something is not right, because usually when I look up, I only see the ceiling. Nothing else. But now I see the ceiling and the corner of my wooden wardrobe.",30,48
1psgwvq,,"As if someone had pushed it closer to my bed, causing it to be in my line of sight. Now that I think about it, the sounds have stopped.",29,49
1psgwvq,,"Quickly, I check my phone that I had placed on the nightstand. 10:15 pm. Strange. This is the first night it stopped sooner. But why..? Again, I shake my head.",30,50
1psgwvq,,"I must be seeing things. Even though I had just slept for many hours in one go, I fall asleep quickly once more.",23,51
1psgwvq,,"All these lost hours from the nights before caught up to me, it seems.",14,52
1psgwvq,,"The next morning, my alarm rings at 6:00 am, so I get up, rub my eyes, slowly walk into the bathroom and get ready for uni.",26,53
1psgwvq,,"I take my bag, put on my shoes and jacket, grab my keys and leave the apartment. But before I actually take the bus, I check my mail.",28,54
1psgwvq,,"You never know. As I stood in front of the letterboxes, I couldn't help but notice that the old, green and rusty bike had fallen over. Odd.",27,55
1psgwvq,,"After staring at it for a while, I shrug and leave. Typical university day. Get up. Leave. Go to uni. Study. Leave. Go home. And go home I did.",29,56
1psgwvq,,"When I get into the complex, I realise that someone put the bike back into place, but something about it looks different. I don't know what it is.",28,57
1psgwvq,,"I mean, it's still green, rusty and ugly. Whatever. With my keys in hand, I enter my apartment and lock the door behind me. A quick glance at my phone.",30,58
1psgwvq,,"""8:00 pm"". Sigh. Another exhausting day done.",7,59
1psgwvq,,"After a short bathroom visit to change and brush my teeth, I hop to bed and try to relax on my phone, till I eventually pass out.",27,60
1psgwvq,,"This night, the moving noises were not as loud which is why I was able to sleep through the night. But when my alarm rings and I wake up, it's...",30,61
1psgwvq,,dark. The air feels thin and heavy. I have trouble breathing.,11,62
1psgwvq,,"Quickly, I use my phone as a flashlight and get up to hit the lightswitch of my bedroom as fast as I can. I didn't even have to run far.",30,63
1psgwvq,,It was only one step to take which didn't make sense... Now I stand here frozen in my bedroom. Hand on the lightswitch. Tears in my eyes.,27,64
1psgwvq,,My bed only one single step away from me. My wardrobe pressed against the side of the bed. The table touching the end of the bed and brushing my side.,30,65
1psgwvq,,The window gone. I had not been wrong the past few days. Something had indeed been weird. The bike falling over and looking like it is out of position.,29,66
1psgwvq,,"Me hitting my foot, even though I should be able to walk around my flat blindfolded. The stuff in my kitchen falling. Everything seeming out of place.",27,67
1psgwvq,,"No one has been moving stuff around next door all these nights. I knew that. I absolutely knew. Because behind that wall where it has been coming from, is... nothing.",30,68
1psgwvq,,"I don't have a neighbour next door, because there is no flat. No room. No furniture. Only the neatly cut grass that surrounds the complex.",25,69
1psgwvq,,"The walls had been moving every single night. And tonight, they locked me in. The room is so small and tiny now. This could be a toddler's or baby's room.",30,70
1psgwvq,,There is no door I could go through. No window. No toilet. No water or food.,16,71
1psgwvq,,"And eventually, I will either die from no oxygen or get crushed by these walls.",15,72
1psgaqu,"""Because of the Implication""",Nothing seems like a greater deterrent to dating than success.,10,0
1psgaqu,,"I don’t know what it is about this generation of men, but it feels like the more accomplished I get, the more I seem to attract the riff-raff.",28,1
1psgaqu,,Years of winning medals for the swim team in college brought enough publicity to keep the good ones away while attracting those who fed off my fame like vampires.,29,2
1psgaqu,,"It’s not that I didn’t know this would happen. My mother always warned me. Traditional men don’t want someone submissive, they want someone independent that they can break.",28,3
1psgaqu,,"And I knew I would never fall for it. At least that’s what I thought, until I met Richard. He had this softness about him that I didn’t quite expect.",30,4
1psgaqu,,"His charm, passion, and fake feminism drew me in like a sucker. Maybe all those years in a dating desert gave me an unquenchable thirst, a longing.",27,5
1psgaqu,,"Or maybe anyone would have fallen prey to him. There was, after all, something otherworldly about him. It started with a book.",22,6
1psgaqu,,"I left my copy of “All about love” behind in my favorite coffee shop. When I came to retrieve it, his hand met mine.",24,7
1psgaqu,,"“Excuse me.” I glanced at the handsome stranger. “Ah, you found my book.” He smiled. “Uh, that’s my book.” I showed him the front page with a dramatic flourish.",29,8
1psgaqu,,My name was as legible as chicken scratch. “So it is.” He mused. “You read bell hooks?” I asked. “Shouldn’t everyone?” He raised an eyebrow. I faltered for a second.,30,9
1psgaqu,,Don’t fall for it. This has to be his schtick or something.,12,10
1psgaqu,,"“Did you forget your matcha latte and canvas tote as well?” 
 
“I think if more men spent time actually trying to become the men they pretend to be, women wouldn’t need to be so cautious of them.” His words felt like honey and I, the hungry bear, fell for his trap.",51,11
1psgaqu,,He was entirely too handsome and it made me incredibly nervous. I fiddled with my metal lighter as we spoke. I swung the lid open and closed.,27,12
1psgaqu,,"The repetition and sound helped relieve some of my stress. “Do you smoke?” He asked, with clear apprehension on his face. “Ah, not anymore.",24,13
1psgaqu,,I just carry this for…luck I guess.” My mom had given it to me before she died. It was the only thing I had left from her. He looked relieved.,30,14
1psgaqu,,"“Oh good. I have very delicate lungs. I don’t do very well around smoke.” 

“Noted.” I nodded.",17,15
1psgaqu,,"“I’m Charlie by the way.” 
 
“Richard but you can call me-”

“Dick?” I stifled a laugh. His smile was infectious.",20,16
1psgaqu,,"“I was going to say Richie, but honestly you can call me anything you’d like.” 
 
“Including Dick?” 
 
“Maybe *almost* anything.” 
 

A simple moment in time set in motion a wildfire of passion.",32,17
1psgaqu,,"The dates, late night phone calls, naughty encounters, and delivered flowers swept me up like nothing had before. He was both the perfect gentleman and the perfect savage.",28,18
1psgaqu,,"He satisfied me in every way I wanted. Except for a gnawing voice at the back of my head. It seemed too calculated, too real.",25,19
1psgaqu,,Almost as though he was programmed as the lead character in my otome game. He seemed to know my every move before I even made it.,26,20
1psgaqu,,"I was so far gone, drunk on his attention, I didn’t even notice the small ways he was chipping away at my life.",23,21
1psgaqu,,"Until, one day, he invited me on a trip. “I’ve never been on a cruise before.” I confessed. “That makes it even more exciting.",24,22
1psgaqu,,I get to see you experience everything for the first time.” He was too convincing.,15,23
1psgaqu,,I wish I had put up more of a fight or at least listened to that raw unease in my gut every time I thought about it.,27,24
1psgaqu,,"It was not your standard, commercial cruise of three thousand guests. Other than the crew, only thirteen total of us boarded. A very intimate arrangement.",25,25
1psgaqu,,"The ship itself was about a fourth the size of a typical cruise ship, with all the suites being at least two thousand square feet each.",26,26
1psgaqu,,Every unit was equipped with its own outdoor hot tub and veranda.,12,27
1psgaqu,,"I let my imagination consider all the possible things we could do in that private hot tub, overlooking the ocean.",20,28
1psgaqu,,"After we boarded and left the harbor, Richard led me to my room, where I would be staying by myself. I felt like I had my own mini apartment.",29,29
1psgaqu,,"At first I thought Richard would be sharing the room with me, but he insisted I feel like a princess on this trip.",23,30
1psgaqu,,He said his room would be next door if I needed anything.,12,31
1psgaqu,,"“Distance makes the heart grow fonder, my love.” At this point he’d grow accustomed to kissing my hand so I didn’t think much of it at the time.",28,32
1psgaqu,,"“I guess.” 

“Let me know when you’ve settled in.",9,33
1psgaqu,,"I can’t wait for you to meet the other guests.”

What I expected was to meet work acquaintances, people he played pickle ball with, or his neighbors.",27,34
1psgaqu,,Nothing could have prepared me for the truth. I met Richard in the ballroom wearing the dress he’d picked out for me.,22,35
1psgaqu,,"It was gold and made of thousands of tiny pieces of metal, likely connected together by hand.",17,36
1psgaqu,,The fabric made a lovely rustle as I walked and felt deliciously cool on my skin. He greeted me warmly and took a moment to behold my appearance.,28,37
1psgaqu,,"“You’re more beautiful than a galaxy. And believe me, I would know.” He kissed my cheek gently. “Thank you.” 
 
“Come.” He led me to join the rest of the group.",30,38
1psgaqu,,"“Let me introduce you to my collection.” 
 
My heart sank at his words and my eyes looked on in horror.",20,39
1psgaqu,,"Twelve women, various beauties of different backgrounds and body types stood before me, all wearing the same dress as me. “Your…*collection?*” I spat in disbelief. “Now, now.",27,40
1psgaqu,,Don’t be that way. I chose you because you are exceptional.,11,41
1psgaqu,,"Just like every one of these ladies.” He beckoned to them and they flocked like obedient pets, surrounding him, and doting on him.",23,42
1psgaqu,,"“I thought you loved me.” 
 

“I do.” He insisted. “Just like I love them.” He walked around slowly kissing the hand of each woman.",24,43
1psgaqu,,"The gesture disgusted me, my own hand burning at the realization. “The thing about flowers” he mused, “Is that they wilt too soon to truly enjoy their beauty.",28,44
1psgaqu,,"If you let me, I can show you a way you will never wilt. Captured in perfection forever.” He smiled and slowly outstretched his arms to me. “Come Charlotte.",29,45
1psgaqu,,"I promise the procedure will be painless.” 
 
“Come” His woman army echoed mindlessly. “Oh hell no.” I immediately bolted back to my room.",23,46
1psgaqu,,"Richard was close behind, followed by his entourage in heels. “Please stop, you’re only making this more difficult for yourself.” He seemed so calm and it angered me more.",29,47
1psgaqu,,"“There’s nowhere to go. We are in the middle of the ocean.” 
 
“Shut up!” I removed one of my heels and threw it at his face.",26,48
1psgaqu,,He caught it with insane precision and closed the gap between us. I felt his hand snatch my left ankle and my face suddenly met the deck.,27,49
1psgaqu,,"Dazed but pumped on adrenaline, I removed my other heel and jammed it into his face. He let out a gurgling scream.",22,50
1psgaqu,,I wiggled back and forth till I freed myself from his almost superhuman grip. I ignored the crunching sound and searing pain. My only goal was survival.,27,51
1psgaqu,,"As I limped away, his doting army surrounded him to try to tend to his wounds, letting out unearthly calls of distress.",22,52
1psgaqu,,"After I reached my room, I bolted the door, and searched for the orange life vest. Richard and the women pounded on the door furiously.",25,53
1psgaqu,,I knew it wouldn’t hold for very long. Suddenly a glimmer of metal caught my eye. My lucky lighter lay ceremoniously on the bed where I had left it.,29,54
1psgaqu,,“Sensitive lungs eh?” I ripped open the mini bar and started emptying them all on the bed. With one rip of my lighter I set a coffee filter aflame.,29,55
1psgaqu,,"Dropping onto the bed, it ignited quickly and grew. I rushed out to the veranda with the life vest and shut the door on the flames spreading behind me.",29,56
1psgaqu,,"As I climbed on the metal railing, my left ankle buckled with pain. I knew there was a chance I wouldn’t generate enough force to clear the decks below.",29,57
1psgaqu,,"You’ve got this Charlie. You’ve got this. With all the force I could muster, I dove from the deck towards the ocean water.",23,58
1psgaqu,,They say traditional men want someone independent they can break and he did break me. That bastard broke my ankle in two places.,23,59
1psgaqu,,What he didn’t count on was how flammable his ship was. I watched it burn down as I swam back towards my freedom. [Previous Archive Entry](,26,60
