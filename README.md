# Diffusion-LM
This repository consists of my work and experimentations while trying to implement a Diffusion based Language Model(LM) from scratch.

### Tasks Achieved:
- Implemented GPT2 following Karpathy's Tutorial
- Trained on the ROCStoreis Dataset.
- Implemented a very basic version of Diffusion-LM

### TO-DOs:
- Improve Diffusion Training - Larger epochs and compare
- Explore Anchoring and Discrete Diffusion methods
- Benchmark with GPT2 on the ROCStories Dataset.
- Document the work and organise the workspace/scripts
- Visualise structure in embedding space using PCA or smth
